0,i thought this was a really well written film i've heard of radio the person before this movie was even created and i can't begin to describe how good cuba gooding jr was in it it will make the women cry everyone laugh and most everyone will leave smiling,1
1,i first played this around or when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it br br the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find ammo and weapons to help from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work br br again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to unlock i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your opponent is and it's surprising to see them behind a door where you are going br br this game gets 1 2 stars or of very good go play it sometime,1
2,let start off by first saying that i have been a punk fan most of my life i always kind of had a lack of respect for the la scene of the early 80's which the decline of western civilization documents with the exception of x and black flag being more of new york and english punk guy after i saw this movie that completely changed the people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond street cree through their lifestyles but it is a great display of hedonism at it's best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll one of the best scenes and actually most insightful is the interview with claude of catholic discipline or boy' as he was known to slash magazine readers originally from france he rants about punk like a dirty old frenchman and clues in viewers to many aspects of the punk or diy attitude to music politics and life in general darby crash of the germs comes off as a complete idiot most of the time but the performance of is pretty decent complete with a young pat smear black performance with chavo pederast on vocals it was filmed a couple of years before henry rollins joined the band is decent and x and fear give the best performances in the movie look out for the interviews with the young punk kids you'll hear some of the funniest things you have ever heard in a documentary highly recommended,1
3,valentine and joe the judge kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of geneva thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers polish fugitives peeping philandering girlfriends renegade dogs and who are too lazy to bin their don't be fooled by the deceptive miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious art house flick this movie is 100 action,1
4,well i'll begin with this i love horror movies not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present second this is the worst movie of all times it even beats mean guns and the attack of the killer tomatoes and for that i pay it homage br br however the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed after which point everything was so so sad to my great surprise the reviews where somewhat divided and you guys who rated this piece of c movie crap from 7 and up i know you're joking good one hahaha because if there is any reason in the world and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is you can't be for real br br everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up so i'll leave it br br minor spoiler alert br br but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog kennel for ten minutes with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two really does it for me,0
5,this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen br br we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant know it all trashy bank robber played by dale robertson and a coy tease played by the extra ordinarily beautiful linda darnell in a fire engine red dress she must have been into that bodice br br a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding the bigots however win the day i could barely sit through the endless dialog of bigotry that issued from the other characters mouths br br except for wounded knee and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians and very few old westerns do this one is exceptionally bad in that regard br br the romance between robertson and darnell set my teeth on edge as he came swaggering in forcing a kiss on her while she plays the old hard to get game br br there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a stagecoach in several shots br br a puzzlingly humorous incident in the storyline is linda character going to great lengths to purchase tickets for the stagecoach only to then demand a horse to ride minutes later for no apparent reason br br another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road and not only that but then all the passengers pile out for a look see br br 1 star,0
6,if you're familiar with the work of auteur johnny to and his band of filmmaking cronies over at milky way you know what to expect with this latest production all the familiar elements are in place the strong camaraderie between two characters usually a cop and a baddie the coincidences and chances that turn on a dime and pay off handsomely in the end and the humor that arises even in the most dire of situations br br andy lau plays a man who has 72 hours to live and decides to rob an insurance company lau ching wan also brilliant in other milky way films like longest nite a hero never dies and where a good man goes portrays a hostage negotiator cop who is on the robber's tail even as the robber sets up a series of tricks and clues that he must follow in order to get his man br br funny poignant and cool while being subtle running is actually one of the most entertaining milky way films to date don't miss the performances by the two leads esp andy lau usually considered an average actor who has rarely been this natural and fun to watch this film is one to go out of your way to see,1
7,julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie musical the opening song by ms andrews whistling away the dark will always be in the back roads of my mind the plot line during world war i is great and suspenseful one if you are a romantic you will love this movie this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again,1
8,nothing great here but a nicely acted story about an abused deaf wife fonda of a small time crook bochner who gets involved with one of her husband's plans and his mistress sutherland and weber are cops drawn into what turns out to be a unmysterious murder investigation and the story just flows along,1
9,i didn't have much faith at the beginning but as a costa citizen i can confirm that the movie shows the reality that we live day by day and shows a lot of things of our culture such as our way to speak our music our way of standing up for our rights without any fear without any weapons br br i'm really proud of the job they did and of how they didn't forget along the movie the message they wanted us to receive not caring for the money but actually working with a short budget letting us appreciate the beautiful scenarios and the great photography br br i strongly recommend seeing this movie you will not regret it,1
10,i clerk in a video store so i try to see the movies we're about to put out each week i don't have a problem with this in fact i sort of feel it's a privilege not so with this film after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home in my free time and if i'd known there was another hour to be endured i might have given up right then i didn't care about the characters the filming was unremarkable and ford made kissing look like a chore even the score was incongruous and jarring what a waste,0
11,surprised to know that the director sebastian was a young venezuelan 28 and bored with so many predictable movies i was delighted with the script showing so many small stories and cues spread here and there directed with black humor and taste i loved the tension between the very rickman and the very natural but beautiful thompson each member of the gang deserves attention gil bellows at his best is remarkable,1
12,this movie is based on the true story of christopher boyce and his friend lee this fascinating story takes place around the time of the dismissal in which during his time as a clerk for christopher was privy to classified correspondence which admitted the cia's involvement in australian political and union circles the movie shows several scenes involving gough transmitted over us tv where events take place which confirm the classified documents that christopher had read previously the removal of gough was an organized cia coup elsewhere in the film it was mentioned that most people have no idea about the level of deception that goes on ultimately to ensure that the us is used as a vehicle to promote certain policies at the behest of everyone else in the current age nothing has changed br br christopher's life was profoundly affected read shocked by his knowledge of what and how the cia shapes foreign including the of allied nations to the united states christopher reacted probably not in the best way at the time by selling top secret information to the soviet union with lee acting as his exchange eventually christopher and were captured and convicted of treason br br on 23rd may 1982 whilst serving time in us prison christopher boyce agreed to a one and only interview with ray martin of 60 minutes australia because it was the australian connection that profoundly affected him it caused a in the australian media for about a week then it went hushed br br i liked the movie's symbolism of the falcon and in it chris was called the falcon and the snowman drug connection but in reality the title falcon was not something that was used by chris br br christopher boyce criminal or man of conscience you decide br br resources http www com boyce html,1
13,j s cardone directed a little known 'video nasty' in 1982 called the slayer and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie the forsaken his latest feature film wicked little things boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie and so turned this one down i don't blame him for it either the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband however what they don't realise is that around a hundred years earlier a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft naturally that's not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of br br the film is essentially a collection of clichés from the youngest kid with an imaginary friend the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish j s cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes mostly involving kids but its not enough the story doesn't play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier mortuary and that's not a good thing although mortuary is actually a better film than this one the acting is nothing to write home about either lori is decent looking as is eldest daughter scout taylor compton but neither manages to provide an interesting performance chloe is slightly better than the usual child actor the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can't even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals it all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies then you can feel free to skip this one,0
14,i think i would probably not hate this movie if i spoke polish i selected the english version at the first menu but it gave me polish dialogue with english subtitles just as the polish version did maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into english very well to exacerbate the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all the acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything one scene that bothered me was when a german woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed close ups of her naked breast for the next 15 20 seconds i couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the americans first the american uniforms did not look anything like u s army uniforms second none of the extermination camps in poland were liberated by the americans i would think that a polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an american born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the russians all in all it's just not a very good film if you don't speak polish,0
15,it's a shame house calls isn't better known is it perhaps because the romantic leads are middle aged shopworn and gun shy rather than oversexed teen stars could be if you're over 35 you'll probably get this comedy if you're over 45 you're really going to get this comedy if you're 25 wait until you're older to see it br br the unlikely pairing of matthau and jackson works precisely because it is so unlikely there's a wonderful line of matthau's that sums up what is happening between the two of them i like old broads because you don't have to explain who ronald coleman is if that's not the exact line it's close br br the premise of a sub par hospital run by incompetents rings true art portrayal of a senile head surgeon is absolutely brilliant it is impossible not to laugh out loud at his delivery subplots if you can call them that are fun too like between matthau and jackson's teenage son everything hits just exactly the right tone br br okay there's the bit where matthau has to wear women's clothing that's a bit over the top and an easy mark but still it's walter matthau in drag it's funny,1
16,this is seriously the worst movie i have ever seen right from the start the movie goes straight down hill with its cheesy music score poor acting and total lack or real story or plot even for a b movie this is down right awful after reading some of the good reviews i thought i'd keep an open mind and watch it but all the bad reviews were so right i totally can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it i'm a huge sci fi fan and this was way more than i could swallow do yourself a favor a move on to a different movie they are many other better movies that deal with this subject matter you have been warned,0
17,haggard the movie is the real life story of ryan dunn and his girlfriend who cheated on him also with the help from his two friend 1 a skate boarder who lives for nothing and 2 a trying to be funny scientist which doesn't really work played by bam and br br the film haggard the movie also has a lot of the characters from jackass etc but to say it was written by bam and co this is a very weak attempt seems to me like it was written when he was bored or as a project with they did not pay a lot of attention to br br the films also stars girlfriend jennifer who plays ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him again very bad acting by jennifer another actor that some people may be interested in is steve a k a hellboy played by which his character does not seem to be with the story again bad acting also this character does not really have a lot of lines in this film which basically makes it very boring but worst of all is character the voice sound like a smoker who basically has throat cancer also i think he could have been improved overall i think the characters in this film aren't with the story like in one scene it would be on one certain character a minute later a different scene different character br br to say that this is supposed to be a film sort of a documentary its not played by the characters as a documentary the acting makes you think that its a cheap attempt at making a film with your spare time br br towards the middle of the film we start to lose focus on the main character ryan dunn although a lot of the attention is on bam and brandon br br in conclusion this film is ok if you laugh at things that aren't very funny stupid stunts terrible acting and the occasional nude scene also i think there there are too many scenes of just no talking and just music 7 10,1
18,this screened at sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd clearly the story is worth relating it's powerful and true but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face i mean really you spend have your time saying oh look it's the guy from or hey it's easy rider and you lose sight of the story perhaps it's the only way this guy could get his movie made but it's a little distracting sort of like 'the love boat or those old towering inferno movies that were o' block with stars ' i wish he's just told the story simply with less famous faces also the camera work seems kind of lazy like there wasn't any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story all in all i thought it was okay but could have been really good,0
19,what uh br br this movie is so dissociative and messed up that i literally lost a bit of my sanity after it was over i will never be the same person again i'm trying to put my finger on what exactly is so completely insane about it it's not just the hilarious techno music or the outside of time medieval blade runner wild west highlander setting or the weird cgi grendel monster that looks like a man made out of animated sausages or even the grendel's mother monster which looks like some alabama table dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed in the tanning bed too long all of those things are weird but what's really the strangest thing in this movie is the acting i simply can't explain this script is obviously hellishly silly but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all lambert is always weird and usually kind of boring but for this one he's gone into dolph territory i can't help but just start laughing every time he talks br br i will give this movie some credit for being completely scatter brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring i'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one br br warning if you are planning on watching christopher lambert as beowulf be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish hyperactive catatonic daze it's true when i was done with my beowulf spirit journey i woke up in the middle of the siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk there was a dead wolf lying next to me and i later found i had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket my vhs copy of beowulf was sitting on a hastily constructed stone altar nearby enshrined with candles and wilted flowers the tape told me to walk i rose and i walked,0
20,another slice of darkness and denial hiding beneath the surface of american suburbia imaginary heroes chronicles the lives of the travis family all recovering following the suicide of their eldest son br br the pair at the center of the film is mother and son sandy sigourney weaver and tim emile hirsch both acting out in different ways as a result of the death while tim experiments with prescription medication and his own sexuality sandy regresses to her former self smoking marijuana and coming to terms with an old act of infidelity br br the relationship between sandy and tim is explored well especially when references are made to both of them being outcast from their own family sandy due to her affair and tim initially due to always being in the shadow of his more successful older brother considerably less time is allowed for sandy's husband ben jeff daniels who in a devastating depiction of denial orders sandy to make an additional plate of food for his dead son and place it in his old spot at the dinner table michelle williams' older sister penny is underwritten and could easily be taken out of the film br br despite its long runtime imaginary heroes doesn't explore its many subplots as much as the individual stories deserve while some of the movie's black comedy doesn't translate as well as writer director dan harris may have liked and the depiction of a disturbed family dynamic isn't depicted as strongly as the many other films out there with similar ideas but despite some issues the central performances from weaver and hirsch are stunning and easily carry the film to its successfully subdued conclusion br br rating b,1
21,i'm not really sure what to make of this movie especially after seeing a great film like la notte unfortunately i saw this in german during an antonioni film festival at the frankfurt film museum so i didn't get to hear great voice he is supposed to tie together four stories about couples in italy however as good an actor as he is malkovich cannot rescue the most ridiculous of the four stories portrayed here a woman who comes up to him at a waterside cafe near a shop she owns and blurts out about how she killed her father nearby then the two of them go home have sex and he leaves it seems as if antonioni lost the subtlety had in earlier films like the passenger when dealing with sex and replaced it with blatant nudity br br however nonsensical the storyline is the film features two things that make it watchable eye and ear candy the actors and actresses are all beautiful people and the cinematography is marvelous scenes in old italian cities contrasting with a bit in a tall apartment building overlooking a city reminiscent of la notte br br the ear candy however is what really makes the film worth watching u2 and brian collaborated on your blue room and beach sequence both of which set the mood perfectly in the film the songs are available on passengers original soundtracks 1,1
22,i should have known better the clues were all over imdb com this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record the cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of joe estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies etc suffice it to say i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful amateurish attempt at film making turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies nuff said,0
23,yeah i made it all the way to the end it was pretty hard though br br sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set the acting well i don't even know what to say i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog br br i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100 minute long audition tape br br i'm not even going to talk about the ending br br the best thing about the movie was the music br br that being said i do not recommend this movie to anyone even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall this is nothing to waste your time on if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie check out the children's hour lost and delirious or high art those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process,0
24,i haven't seen this film since it came out in the mid 70s but i do recall it as being a very realistic portrayal of the music business right up there with paul simons one trick pony another vastly underrated film imo br br harvey keitel does an excellent job as a producer caught between the music he believes in and the commercial tripe the record company suits want him to work with br br since i spent my entire career in the music business as a composer arranger producer i can really vouch for the verisimilitude this film possesses br br if it should ever come out on dvd uncut i'd buy it,1
25,barbet murder by numbers starring sandra bullock is solid work though not particularly compelling i am a big sandra bullock fan and she is effective here as forensic detective cassie mayweather who is not very likable and a broken person too however there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure it's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers richard ryan who is the cool one and justin michael pitt who is the sympathetic geek basically richard and justin kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night they are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing but it just doesn't work here tony script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder and it is truly by the numbers we have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority and we just want them to take a fall br br this is not a great exploration into the dark side like reversal of fortune about claus von bulow there are interesting turns in numbers the movie is not so much a thriller but rather a character study of cassie sandra bullock balances the bravado of cassie her fear of letting people get in with her and her secret past bullock brings courage and strength to a suffering character her partner and sort of love interest sam played by ben chaplin is more a plot than a real character though chaplin does the bewilderment thing very admirably the other nice touch is having richard and justin involved a strange sexual attraction the most interesting thing about numbers are pitt and br br there are many entertaining twists and turns throughout the movie everything is done very competently i saw the movie about a week ago and in retrospect i like it a little more than i did when i saw it however it is just not inspired work sandra bullock and barbet schroeder deserve a lot better and so do we,1
26,i discovered the patriot in a dvd store and thought it could be a real action thriller no it´s instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story it´s no doubt a cable movie and not one for the theatre fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an anti virus against sleep one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot you can really feel the american air but that´s all i hope for steven seagal that he finally succeeds in a big hit it is not a must see because i and my wife voted average 4 10,0
27,i for one absolutely loved this movie br br it is not a typical asian horror where you would see a gruesome looking ghost usually a woman that is going around scaring people you barely see any ghosts for a majority of the film but the way this movie keeps you interested in the plot and characters is genius this is not the movie for you if you're into gore e g saw hostel or surprise scares where stuff pops out at you hollywood horror slasher films but this movie has an underlying creepy factor throughout the entire movie which i loved is a progressive and somewhat experimental approach to horror amongst the ridiculous remakes and unoriginal crap being released by hollywood in today's society br br please don't let the documentary style of filming turn you off why should it it is far superior to the blair witch project because for one the acting in is brilliant and it really makes you really feel like you're watching something you're not supposed to be seeing br br is definitely one of the best horror movies i have ever seen only a few films have made it into my top 5 horror and this movie holds a solid 1 spot on my list,1
28,read the book forget the movie,0
29,i really enjoyed this epic thought not quite so much as the english patient a modern day classic the first 20 minutes or so feel awkward but as jude law embarks on the journey back to his love ava nicole kidman the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable thoughtful romantic drama apparently it is fashionable to hate kidman at the moment but i don't agree at all and she does well here i actually think that the romance between and ada is weakly developed in the script they really don t get much screen time together to develop a relationship but law and kidman give it their all and convince ada's journey is the crux of the film she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything zellweger at first seems all wrong as ruby but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes the film has beautiful photography and set design but never really captures the true feel of a period piece jack white in particular has long hair and a pale that look completely out of place with the setting cillian murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented irish actor in an early bit part and natalie portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence it's a pity that in the other boleyn girl she's so inadequate,1
30,larry bishop the writer actor director focuses too heavily on the camera music and visuals the film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues which seem to have no purpose other than boring and irritating the audience the actors experience a bumpy ride from the film's start to finish and are caught in one terrible smoke screen the hell with the ride the film is a bomb br br the victors are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness they are bikers anti heroes and protagonists played by larry bishop is the leader of the pack the gent michael madsen is trapped in his own crossfire of chaos and psychosis br br comanche eric balfour is loyal but mysterious deuce performed by david carradine should have passed on the ride and so should the ticket buyers if you decide to see the film you'll be sorry but you'll find out why billy wings vinnie jones is a lewd and venomous character completely filled with disdain br br what puzzles me is how this film with all of its continual ramblings and vulgarity ever got anybody to invest in a ride that absolutely goes nowhere ticket buyers take my advice don't pay for the ride please don't make the same mistake as the investors br br the first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is confusing and unintelligible the dialog which rapidly turn into meaningless monologues doesn't make any sense the entire film is hell bent on going nowhere poor dennis hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess he too should have passed on the ride there are decapitated heads slashed throats and nude females wrestling it is clear that bishop doesn't know where he is going with the film he gets entirely lost but by the end of the ride you just won't give a damn mama mia stay home and by all means don't take the ride i rate this film a 1 out of 10 but this movie is so awful it deserves a zero,0
31,try not to see this one i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigley's work i was wrong i should have said no and watched gigli instead which is probably a far better film i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor nothing about it was funny or even close to funny the acting is bad even for the queen of cheesy 80's films there is no story just random clips i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap i'm sorry but i don't find zombies doing aerobics funny,0
32,there's potential in there with tell no one a curious and intriguing plot and a french take on a very american story but for me the opportunities were not exercised here br br although i liked aspects of this film there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten br br firstly it's a silly clichéd murder mystery a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac being french doesn't eliminate this problem it's just silly and in french at the same time it's full of implausible coincidences br br secondly the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically this french doctor hanging out on the streets of a french city with his new homies and their suvs and then there's the car chases br br but thirdly and mostly it's just too darn long to me a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes and over two hours takes some serious justification this once didn't have it,0
33,i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah so i rented it bad idea this movie was bad on so many levels that i'm glad that i had the option to fast forward the shark itself is ok it's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1 i gave it a 2 the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable i wasn't expecting much but i was continually surprised by this suckfest antonio sabato jr is some kind of biologist or scientist or something i wasn't really paying attention he goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course by the way all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater first of all if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the and stuff are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against antonio and this young college student horrible actress by the way just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble what is with that unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background metal crafting is very important when your on a sub i guess anyway i could go on but i've said too much already bottom line go to your local video store rent this video and then destroy it then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed we can do it if we work together,0
34,this movie is amazing it is funny sexy violent and sick but it all holds together for a brilliant troma rendition of romeo and juliet if you don't mind being grossed out a bit ok a lot but it's funny grossed out see this movie it's worth it there's not one level on which it doesn't deliver i've seen it thrice now and it is still amazing i recommend it go get it,1
35,according to the budget information given on this web site dark harvest had an estimated budget of 130 000 where this money was spent i'm not exactly sure let me see costumes no location and sets hmmm think not special f x not acting lessons ah no dark harvest tells the epic tale of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of west virginia his girlfriend talks him into taking their friends up there to check the place out once there our intrepid hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method for getting his crops to grow and now it's revenge time killer scarecrows out for revenge ewww scary well no not really we all know there have been some terrific movies made with very little money but this is not one of them this film contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialog i've ever seen terrible clichés with terrible delivery all in all do not be fooled by the half way decent cover and avoid at all costs i'd like to give the film makers at least a d for trying but i'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with that grade f,0
36,tourist trap 1979 is an entertaining horror movie from the late 70's the movie is about a bunch of young friends who get stranded on an old deserted lane by a creepy old waxwork museum br br the owner of the museum seems like a strange but harmless old man but things take a very nasty turn when members of the young group start getting killed off who is responsible for the murders is it old man or is it his collection of creepy mannequins who seem to be alive and hungry for blood this film was good stuff it was fast faced the performances were very good from the actors actresses tanya roberts was very sexy and the film was never boring and like i say it had some very creepy scenes so be prepared to hide under the covers definitely recommended to horror movie ghost story fans i give this film a highly respectable 7 2 out of 10,1
37,i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie and finally an european one so maybe my expectations were to high br br it begins with a good quiet horror shock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes where the plot begin being introduced as the acting and the motivation life of the characters reveals itself no better than any 'made for tv' drama it keeps that way right into the end br br about the horror part of the movie it is certainly a good idea and a different one but all the scenes are of the it before' kind br br overall my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept which was inserted into a mediocre story bad acting and less than tolerable plot holes br br,0
38,i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several times cannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful br br the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy handed they were still fun br br i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered,1
39,the movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an african american passenger an airline for negligence there is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing but the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence after this point they clearly ran out of ideas if you stuck around long enough you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made it is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking dope toilet humor styling of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect african american pop culture and pretty much nothing else you'd think that the only 3 white passengers onboard would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens they were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they behaved avoid,0
40,after 15 minutes watching the movie i was asking myself what to do leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth i finally watched the movie what a waste of time maybe i am not a 5 years old kid anymore,0
41,seems to have been made as a vehicle for w c fields and carol dempster and they dominate it fields already has his film character well developed carol dempster seems to dance through the film and her acting reminds me of mary pickford who also worked a long time under d w griffith typical of later griffith films technically br br later remade as poppy the original title with fields in the same role,1
42,i always enjoy watching this cartoon with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train rather than at grandma's house it's actually a standard fare but entertaining especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train when you watch this over and over like my little boy did who loves trains which is why he liked it so much you begin to notice some things br br throughout this short the position of the baggage car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or 5th and in long shots not at all the engine has either the number or or none at all the coal tender has either the number 99 or the letters s p q r on it or no number or letters at all the coaches carry the s p q r without the in long shots and then in closeups it has the words southeast and western br br all of this doesn't interfere with the story but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully br br still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety,1
43,i just adore this film i love all characters and i can watch it again br br and again and i use to listen to the soundtrack again and again br br although i have seen it about two years after it was made and i br br have never been such youngster as jip and company i can br br understand them and i love their stories and if somebody thinks this film is crap i disagree and i say it is br br full of positive energy and friendship and love and full of youth br br the weekend has landed enjoy it,1
44,two things too long and totally lacked credibility this movie didn't make any sense and was to sit through i am usually pretty patient but man it just doesn't keep your attention at all i think i am being nice here even you keep thinking it's almost over only to find out it's still got another half hour good actors,0
45,i always had this concept that korean movies were all about comedy and drama but christmas in autumn has changed my point of view this movie is so simple it have any melodramatic scenes or over the top comedy scenes not a single scene where the actors cry out loud not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss not even a simple kiss and yet this movie is able to reach it's viewers in ways that i dint know existed the ending of the movie left me speechless i dint even cry but my eyes were red hot this movie left me a feeling i can hardly describe in words br br i don't think i can recommend this movie to everyone but i do recommend this movie to people who want to watch real cinema 9 4 10,1
46,as long as you don't mind paying a little more attention than you normally might for other films this is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see the film portrays an incident that might occur in real life nothing in it seems fictional at all in fact it also portrays how people might react in real life br br in fact it portrays these so well that is seems like real life combine that with the lack of a soundtrack and you've almost got the best news like movie you've ever seen jane fonda and jack lemmon are particularly good in this late seventies masterpiece evoking concern on her end and genuine tragic pity on his end i highly recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers,1
47,i usually like period films but this one just seemed to drag and drag i'd perk up during rupert graves' scenes but vanessa redgrave just put me to sleep br br i was disappointed in the film it lacked a little punch at the end that i'd hoped it would have,0
48,silly disney film about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good still the script is very bad all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy everybody's trying to be funny and they're not a real boring stupid disney film but it was fun seeing kurt russell so young,0
49,a film by almodovar sends a tingle down my spine every time the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteur's latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns gentle wisecracking i haven't even got as far as the infant terrible's critically reviled early work and after a beautiful opening montage with the camera roving across a wind swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spell br br yet once my nostalgia had subsided there was very little to fill its place for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women penelope cruz is a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter's accidental killing of her abusive husband thankfully she lives in almodovar's spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails add to the melting pot the ghost of mother and a host of other eccentrically warm hearted matriarchs means literally to return and pedro does appear to be recycling old material the sub plot of incest feels as though it were tacked on as the obligatory taboo instead of commenting on or subverting the issue as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film's chick flick sentimentality i suggest almodovar call his next film to move on,0
50,this movie was terrible john wayne is a brutal actor at times the lead female playing the role of maura did a good job and tried her best to make scenes believable despite wayne's inept one dimensional over acting seriously did you see him when he was supposed to be talking in his sleep ridiculous and his character became such an awful person in the second half of the movie and then did nothing to atone for his behavior and is still forgiven by everyone including his arch nemesis without even so much as a 'sorry' the story was completely implausible we were supposed to believe that two grown men both tremendous successes in their respected fields would sabotage a job and risk the lives of innocent men simply because they disliked one another you can pretty much randomly select any scene and it will probably leave you shaking your head in disbelief that someone paid money to have this film made its too bad because the only other wayne films i've seen are the shootist and rio bravo which were both great movies unless you're being paid don't bother watching this one,0
51,this is a fine under rated film and rip torn well known as he is is a seriously under rated actor i read howard frank novel many years ago how well craven captures the book and the beauty of vermont's northeast kingdom i had the good fortune to grow up in vt in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the incident took place i've not seen stranger in the kingdom the craven collaboration based on the incident and another novel but this film has inspired me to track it down,1
52,this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10 my advice is don't watch it this doesn't even classify as a movie br br you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny they are actually very lame and stupid very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie might even upset their careers a little br br when i walked into blockbuster the main focus was on this movie so i decided rent it i sincerely regret it br br once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen i was hoping it would get better but instead it got worse br br i am not exaggerating this the movie is terrible don't watch it hope this helps,0
53,this is a family movie set in 1950's rural america about a boy whose uncle presses sheep killing charges against his dog drum starting not only a family legal feud but community discord as their town begins to take sides br br this is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were scott bakula defense lawyer ron perlman father owner and the dog john and kathy garver sissy from the original family affair as the uncle and his wife were okay the children were not that good basically they looked like they were acting and that's a problem when the film really revolves around them aaron who plays the bully donny makes me think of what the actor russell crowe must have looked liked as a child only with no talent but a lot of ham br br favorite line spoken by the prosecutor after scott bakula's defense closing trial speech we'll be lucky if they don't lynch us br br favorite line spoken by ron perlman after his son punches the bully now making him your friend that will be the hard part br br cute enough to rent buy used,0
54,note to self never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there are possibilities for a very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments,0
55,another brilliant portrayal by kiefer sutherland who plays mickey hayden a cop dealing with psychic visions of murdered victims i absolutely love movies dealing with the psychic realm and i wasn't disappointed with eye of the killer aka after alice i only wish the movie had been released theatrical first,1
56,wow i'd hate to sound opinionated but anyone that rated this movie any higher than i just have must have an i q that reaches unimaginably low depths which reach out beyond time and space and connect at planet hopper is a retard for making this movie wow this movie stank fred ward's haircut looks i actually considered mailing fred ward some money in compensation for that miserable haircut he owned in this awful film jodie foster of course didn't have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance throughout joe pesci oh my joe pesci who mysteriously is not cast plays the ultimate stereotypical joe pesci movie character complete with mob killing and constant use of the f word you won't believe your eyes dean stockwell watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because i actually thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the course of the film jon turturro must have been intoxicated himself when he agreed to be in this along with vincent price bob dylan and charlie sheen i know what you're thinking great cast i know and it was the worst great cast film i've ever seen dennis hopper directs and stars and does equally bad in both areas how the man could have directed easy rider and then this is far beyond my excellent imagination his outrageously bad hit man character accent is beyond the realms of horrendous and only is equaled by the hilariously bad ending they hopper and foster are the most uninteresting couple i believe that i have ever come across in my exposure to the world of cinema and you will be cheering for them to lose and then be grandly maddened by the ending what exactly are the two of them wearing at that action filled conclusion i don't know but i do know that if i ever meet dennis hopper i will make immensely make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid join me ian,0
57,this is the type of late night cable flick usually associated with andrew stevens or shannon tweed though unlike most of tweed and stevens' t a fueled vehicles this is lethally dull br br let's cut to the chase the real reason for watching this non thriller is to see shannon breasts anyone who states otherwise is a liar however most of her steamy sex scenes appear to be all smoke and mirrors br br notice that all the shots where her head and chest show at the same time are quick peek a boo flashes the frames where the camera lingers on her nude body there's little or no face attached or she's behind a dripping wet shower door br br all you boob watchers out there know what that means body double br br i must admit though that the finale where is bound blindfolded and menaced with a knife provided a certain fetishistic thrill br br if you find a vhs copy anywhere buy it as all involved are probably too embarrassed to ever let this come out on dvd,0
58,a spin off comedy talk show from the creators of marenghi's the new series man to man with dean learner focuses on manager publisher and publicity agent as played by richard br br nightclub owner restaurateur publisher international playboy dean learner is a one man brand br br after his co funded channel 4 television hit garth marenghi's darkplace he now invites you into his luxury penthouse flat for an all new entertaining and immensely stylish tv talk show br br man to man with dean learner will feature all dean's remaining celebrity friends as well as plenty of live music and fine fish dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class but not fish br br i attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches there are distinct comparisons to alan me knowing you' in the layout but richard and matt unique writing style take it to another level br br if your a fan of darkplace then you can't miss it catch it when its aired late this summer,1
59,there's not a dull moment in francois robe it's surprising how much is packed into this short film while reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette she invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach on returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen she lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl his gay companion is sexually excited early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended she suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance it's a light hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes,1
60,i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the 80's i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonna's character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor like in this movie pure beauty and genius,1

62,this was a film based on the novel written by the modern literary god that is koontz i refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the genius' koontz name ever since my sight became poor enough to require large print i have been unable to read this book as i had at least twice a year since first reading it i missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in large print br br i was hoping by renting this movie i would at least get my vicarious watcher's pleasures but this movie was a travesty because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of mr or most decent authors for that matter books can be crammed into 1 2 hours of film br br it will be the wise network cable or other wise who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple part television movie i e mini series of this book the right way br br one a star out of five would that i could go lower,0
63,let me get this straight the church has a safety lock down mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground maybe i'm missing the plot maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of film making or something this movie is about as useless as the church itself hey maybe that's the point that whole rosemary's baby esq segment was hilarity i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that the entire film needs to be remade properly there were so many things that were played down so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling i'm not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating,0
64,feeling minnesota is one of the worst films i have ever seen it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man at the wedding she meets his brother they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her he than seems to become friends with and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body this loops about and several characters dies or come back to life but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody cameron diaz keanu reeves and dan the direction dialogue and visual effects are just horrible a disgusting and horrible movie,0
65,i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old who can forget some of the best lines in film history johnny's fat boy burgers johnny's fat boy burgers and look between the giant melons i used to wish i could run all over the city in a treasure hunt as fun as this it's an all time fave and i'm happy to hear that it's out on video i'm positive that this is where mtv got its original premise for the road rules series,1
66,this movie contains real animals been killed like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an been cut open i find this totally deranged and sick and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash br br this movie is so stupid and daft that it has no logic at all br br there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie still don't bother viewing this trash for that if you want to see boobs and sex watch a porno instead there is also rape scenes in this movie which i found disgusting like women been raped and cut up and eaten this movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks seeing people been cut up and eaten br br a lot of the animals like the monkey that appeared in this movie there is none in the jungles of new guinea the local characters most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea it looks like this movie was made around the grounds of a resort which i bet it was br br stay away from this trash its sick and deranged,0
67,the poet carne disappears didn´t he disappeared with prévert and is followed by the judge carne the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesn´t understand and he doesn´t want to it´s a long way from the wonderful les enfants du paradis,0
68,all those who are into the pc culture are aghast at the dogmatic christian view of this film claiming it contains racist and or religious intolerance br br those who don't care about this but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here br br those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public as evidenced in comments here br br what is an interesting premise which isn't original but is a combination of ghost and from beyond is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film yet done with gusto what the crew and actors lacked in sensibility professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display br br it isn't nearly as bad as many here think and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans however it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout and is close to on par with a corman produced entry of his earliest period of work or the material of arkoff or sam katzman if you get it for 2 or less as did i you won't feel disappointed but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made,0
69,this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b its title promises far more than the film delivers it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality the people are agreeable even the obligatory flamboyant type the lead kevin mckidd overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all simon callow playing a horny straight is always worth watching and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie however the rubbish about his men's group meditations or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non stop inaction the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack let the thing run you won't miss anything hugo weaving's character is superfluous he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all the outcome of that sequence isn't explained and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story the movie is a total disappointment at the end because there is no resolution the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits this is an interlude with no structure,0
70,before i had seen this film i had heard some negative comments about it however when watching it i found myself thinking ok it's a little slow paced but this is quite interesting as it built toward the end it created a complex moral dilemma leading to a shocking yet within the context of the film entirely believable decision with extremely powerful dramatic consequences if this had been followed through it would have been a tremendously powerful ending and would have given me a very favourable impression of the film br br however due to an ending which not only cops out emotionally on an unnecessary happy ish ending without real emotional credibility but also within the context of the film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for you clearly see one of the character take an action which should end her life but inexplicably doesn't incidentally please tell me if i did miss something here and there is a reason why she survives as i just couldn't how logically she could have and this wrecked the whole film for me br br this said all three leads put in powerful performances although kevin characters' transformation by the end goes a little further than is fully convincing and it does create a very powerful ethical triangle br br this film is recommended if you ready yourself to walk out when the mother and the sister are lying on the bed but do not watch further than this unless you have only a pinch but several mountains of salt,0
71,yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia melodrama supernatural action and plain old school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue br br in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home lei jackie chan pretends to be a heartless cad driving her away and thus saving her from danger br br during the attack relatives are all killed but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang whose leader a scar faced woman seems to have the hots for him then goes in search of chin chin whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk br br during his quest to find his true love befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'bloody rain' clan eventually after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry and then nursed back to health by the scar faced killer bee who shows her love by burning his face ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character his friend chu chuk is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'bloody rain' clan who has plans to marry chin chin himself br br cue the drawn out climactic battle with getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex pal to death with a scarf br br even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero but for most this film will have very limited appeal,0
72,best in show is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event the only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in best in show act more sane than their owners funny stuff from a top notch cast that includes eugene levy who co wrote the film catherine o'hara parker posey michael jennifer coolidge jane lynch and christopher guest who co wrote with levy and directed they're all funny but fred willard steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things plus the dogs are cute too best in show isn't exactly the laugh riot that i expected but there are laughs and it's worth seeing br br out of four,1
73,steve martin looks like he's had a face lift something very strange about his face i usually like anything steve does but this movie comes off as trashy not funny didn't think charlene encouraging him to be rough with his wife was a good message to be sending out to teens watching this film,0
74,another decent offering from the pen of vince gilligan br br a pre malcolm in the middle bryan cranston plays patrick crump a deranged guy who eventually hijacks mulder via gunpoint and has him driving west at high speeds it has something to do with his severe head ringing possible deadly combustion his wife just experienced it and the pressure only seems to be relieved by heading towards the left coast only mulder could relate to this guy's plight and actually bond with his captor before the all night ride is completed br br meanwhile scully seems to have solved the case with a possible remedy for mr crump and will meet them at the ocean check it out to see if our dynamic duo can hook up at the pacific and somehow rectify mr big problem,1
75,this movie was a sweet cutesy romantic comedy just the kind of movie i usually dislike but this one was just cute enough to keep me interested it was really funny in one moment probably why i liked it and then just as serious in the next plus it had ellen in it and i've always had a soft spot for her br br basically the owner of a book store helen kate capshaw finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her store she thinks it is for her and goes crazy trying to figure out who sent it she has kind of shut herself off from the world so it really throws her for a loop eventually almost everyone connected with her finds this letter and they are all getting mixed signals which creates some really funny moments br br like i said i am usually not one for this type of movie but i really wound up enjoying it and recommend it highly,1
76,endless repetition about the evil world bank imf globalization and the americans are blamed for all of africa's the movie is long about two hours but it seems longer the french actually occupied the country in which the movie takes place for centuries but are only peripheral bad guys br br one doesn't learn enough about any of the characters to really care what's happening to are completely marginal to the preaching which goes on and on and on there's no plot no character development no humor except for a few pokes at bush and but that's almost cheating it's so easy and the production values are redemption there br br it is amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and convey utterly zero real information the irish ballad i was dying and then the famine came has more content br br the movie is boring the sub titles are tough to read there is no real content about the subject of the film and the propaganda is relentless br br skip this one,0
77,this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me i sure enjoyed canning those last night is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy comedy and am totally baffled by these positive reviews,0

79,movies are something you see on saturday night and forget by sunday morning motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever mishima falls into the latter category this is the type of thing that should win academy awards a brilliant visual peice of film that is both depressing and uplifting instead of doing a straightforward look at the life of yukio mishima director paul schrader interweaves three adaptations of the author's stories into a look at his past and final day on earth the day he tried to lead the japanese military into rebellion in the name of the emperor failing to do that he commits ritual suicide in an ending that hits you like a ton of bricks the three short story adaptations allow a look into what led him to this and are presented in an experimental way that makes them appear to be filmed stage plays ken is magnificent as mishima despite his eccentricities he comes off as very sympathetic a man who is quite willing to die for his beliefs and does this makes the ending that much more devastating and the sense of loss more meaningful of the three story adaptations temple of the golden house and runaway horses it is the last that is the strongest and most emotional it also is the story that most closely matches mood in his final years and illustrates what truly led him to the events of november 1970 this review cannot be complete without a mention of philip glass' striking musical score not since 2001 has a film score been such a perfect compliment to it's visuals paul schrader crafted one of the most beautiful movies of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter have the hankies at the ready because the ending will leave you in tears mishima a life in four chapters reminds you that sometimes film can still be an art form and as art it is brilliant,1
80,i just want to comment to the woman above that the movie does credit beethoven in the begging in the beginning credits they show it thank you i think this is an amazing movie they picked just the right music for the mood of the movie the animation is wonderful and they picked the voices for the characters very well it teaches children to never give up and to always have hope princess doesn't give up and it shows children that they can do the same the movie also has humor in in for all ages parents and children to laugh at the colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good while they are watching it i watched this movie for the first time now i am a huge fan and i'm sure your child will be too walmart sells tons of barbie and the magic of pegasus stuff so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they aren't watching it thank you,1
81,thank god i didn't buy this movie myself i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed this has got to be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets the acting was horrible so was the editing the dialogue everything it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it i'm looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to stoop to watch this joke,0
82,this is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless yes there is some violence but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie this is not a completely bad picture i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable however a lack of the originality really hurts voodoo all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo horror movies like scream are your favourite then you'll love voodoo but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film,0
83,i actually liked certain things about this game i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close in your face the graphics really weren't bad but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter the music was fine the things i hated were the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality the inability to save was awful some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later i thought the weapons kind of sucked too this game is fun for awhile but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person but that's about it play it at your own risk,0
84,this film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of hollywood crap i've seen recently the acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing there really isn't much to the story it's simple and it works well an easy film to just sit down and enjoy the mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals the film obviously has aspects of horror yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things you won't be laughing out loud hysterically with this one but you'll be smiling the whole way through the humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn't hurt i really watched this movie based on the fact that ron perlman was in it his role is a bit smaller than i expected but it doesn't matter the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged if you like horror watch this if you like comedies watch this just go ahead and watch this anyway it's really quite excellent,1
85,it's a soap opera drawing upon an applied ethics idea a movie about human suffering and death is not necessarily a good movie i didn't get any emotion from it the ideas are not at all new the tension lacks it becomes tedious towards the second half but towards the end i think it becomes quite interesting in a burlesque way i mean you have this middle aged paralyzed bald guy who gets more women than don juan he doesn't seem to suffer as much as you would expect from someone completely paralyzed for over 28 years he has no issues with god and one would probably expect that too the people around him seem to be the perfect slaves i can't get out of my mind bergman's cries and whispers similar to this one in many respects which simply bursts with emotions and not all of them humane etc this movie is the perfect recipe for housewives who look for some emotional thrill but don't expect to be blown away the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer amenabar doesn't rub your face in it and he doesn't take sides he doesn't want to make us fanatics for a particular idea still i have no clue as to why this movie was so highly regarded,1
86,and thus was born the most amorous skunk ever to grace the silver screen while the plot has an abused cat painting himself like a skunk and inadvertently attracting pepe le pew called henry here pepe certainly steals the show no doubt chuck jones realized that this love seeking member of the had that special something necessary to be a star in his own right and so he cast pepe in for scent reasons four years later firmly establishing enduring presence on screens everywhere br br so while odor able kitty may be a place holder otherwise i try to imagine watching it for the very first time in 1945 could anyone have guessed that this supporting character would soon join the ranks of bugs daffy porky and the rest whether or not anyone did pepe remains one of the most likable characters to this day c'est l'amour,1
87,seriously all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the catholics why doesn't lucifer ever mess with the other denominations br br the plot is that played by former jason vorhees kane hodder has a plot to become human but wasn't he always a demon by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child except maybe she isn't his sister the plot isn't clear on this and they inter splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem br br the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a exam to prove her hymen is still intact her sister played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby concludes that this is a sign from heaven praise be br br well the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off in order a truck driver her friend's boyfriend and her friend all being watched by an ex military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born we discover that is actually a catholic cardinal who is running the whole thing br br the ending is pretty much incomprehensible and if you could make it that far straight through you have a stronger stomach than i did i paused the film a couple of times it was so awful,0
88,i don't believe it sixty percent of voters voted this show as ten now how the hell is the rating a five point eight it impossible i don't get it its totally pathetic i mean how anyway the show is great the story is great and the characters are interesting definitely a ten out of ten from me i think the creatures are cool they look great and i wish i had a great show great cgi hope there's a second series as a lot went unanswered in the first season and when is gonna get any bigger as the rest of the creatures are huge again why is the rating so low when the votes were so high br br 10 10,1
89,murder over new york is one of the better chan mysteries and i've just seen this for the first time br br in this one charlie chan is visiting new york to attend a police convention at the same time people who are involved with aircraft plants are being murdered and he decides to help with the investigation along with his number 2 son these murders turn out to be the results of sabotage at the aircraft plants and chan helps to identify the murderer br br charlie chan is played well by sidney toler and the rest of the cast includes sen yung as his number 2 son and marjorie weaver br br i rather liked this mystery and is worth having if you like this sort of thing br br rating 3 and a half stars out of 5,1
90,well it is standard hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off it's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable i must confess i did not really enjoy it but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it br br it is quite sweet and the actors give good performances it's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good but the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back personally i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life br br the chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there this isn't one of them,0
91,what is there to say about this movie this movie is simply gorgeous a true feast for the eyes in the same way that the game set the standard for 3d role playing games 7 years ago this movie sets the standard for future cg movies many of you have seen the trailers and the amazing details in every frame and let me tell you this movie does not disappoint you can actually see the fibers in cloud's sweater vest br br the music is also very good the movie contains several rearranged tracks from the video game that fans will definitely recognize and appreciate br br the movie's main weakness is its story its not exactly a bad story but this story is exclusively aimed for people who have played the video game first time viewers may feel lost at times or they may not notice the significance of certain events br br i recommend this movie to everyone even if you've never played the game because what we have here is a special movie watch it and enjoy the the beautiful show,1
92,in the era of the farrelly brothers and the jackass series to have a movie made and performed by americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well nigh miraculous this ensemble has been behind some other efforts most recently a mighty wind which was so subtle it seemed to be an actual documentary without the overlay of entertainment but best in show hits on all cylinders it is superbly cast with some of the best of current us actors parker posey who exudes energy even when she stands still eugene levy as tolerant everyman who is nobody's doormat even when he appears to be or maybe the brilliant stylings of fred willard the understated performances of so many others which is a characteristic not normally associated with americans or american actors one of the few humorous movies i can watch again and again,1
93,this is not the true story it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events it endorses suicide morose obsession with death a totally gratuitous at organized religion in general and the anglican church in particular and generally provides a nihilistic pointless world view from which filmgoers i suppose are intended to walk away richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness br br utter trash though attractively performed by a capable cast that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering however is very much false advertising you want the real story rent tale' that's the real story see if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case i only found one the girls who made the original photographs were pre pubescent,0
94,when i saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 i assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100 this is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term poorly written and weakly directed with so called actors unable to act but able to grimace when ordered to for the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight with extremely poor special effects unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers the writer cheats it is obvious that the father was added to the so called story line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement not that the write would even know the word denouement some movies go directly to dvd this one should have gone directly to the dustbin,0
95,i'm originally from brazil the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation that was done to that boy they told his life story and he never got one brazilian cent of that movie fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through that life style in brazil sad but that is the world we live in it's about making money not saving lives question is where is fernando today most probably dead we tend to want to live in this disney filled fantasy life when someone comes up to the plate to help along comes the higher power and says what do i get from this where's my cut i wish people's conscience would speak up,1
96,bar hopping seems to be trying to be about the stereotypical bar tender and lay shrink serving up pearls of wisdom followed by example vignettes played out by the cast however this turkey is a jumbled mess with a script full of simple minded cliched nonsense hard to follow herky jerky flow unsatisfying and not worth the time d,0
97,i was very disappointed when this show was canceled although i can not vote i live on the island of i sat down to see the show on tuesday and was very surprised that it didn't aired the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled br br it's true not every one was as much talented as the other but there were very talented people singing br br i find it very sad for them br br that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down br br its a pity br br,1
98,this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot br br i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self reflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues br br the attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing comedically or otherwise br br overall it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness,0
99,i really only watched this movie because it had rupert in it who i knew as ron from the harry potter movies i had never really appreciated rupert as an actor until this movie i loved the entire film rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious quirky movie i think the movie could have been fine without the sex but it worked somehow i can't wait to see more of films in the future julie walters also did an amazing job in the harry potter movies she has a very small role so i didn't quite know what to expect from her either but she was wonderful as dame the part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious overall an amazing movie,1
100,i can't believe that isaiah washington and ice t were in this mess the plot and i use that term very loosely centers around an army of rats that terrorize an urban apartment complex at least i think that's what it was about the script made no sense at all i couldn't have cared less about the characters and the camera work consisted of repeatedly showing shadow images of rats standing on their hind legs or running running is what i should have done as an african american male i often read pleas from my brothers and sisters to support african american films i try to help out but enough is enough no one should watch garbage like this for any reason whatsoever please brothers and sisters don't produce any more direct to video rat turds like this please,0

102,this existential thriller in portuguese with english subtitles is a modern version of the american filmes of the 40s complete with a surprise twist at the end it is riveting from beginning to end my only criticism is its poor production values the film looks cheaply made and it probably was so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of godard in vivre sa vie to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier most maddening of all the subtitles are often hard to read when will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background i'd give this an 8 overall although with better production values it could have been higher,1
103,ok look this show is the worst show on nick night i love so many shows on nick night and i love them when this show came on to nick night i was so annoyed it's such a boring show and it is corny out of all the times i've watched i found one episode slightly funny this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever this show sums up to terrible give props to fresh prince of bel air and george lopez this show is boring and not the least bit clever this show should have been canceled much earlier i don't think it deserves to be played on nick night alongside some great classic shows this show is lacking cleverness good jokes and style,0
104,noel coward is perfectly cast as a suave vain selfish well educated upper class publisher the literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success they constantly meet at noel coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm br br cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change noel coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship she ends her relationship with her fiancé to become lover however noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship this breaks heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing cora br br the story picks up when noel coward leaves new york city by plane chasing after a new lover a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is however a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing noel god takes pity on him and grants him one month on earth to find someone who will cry for him otherwise he is condemned to wander the earth never to find rest for all eternity br br the climax takes place on a dim rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle a strange redemption occurs the death experience teaches noel the true values of life although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message br br the film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir unfortunately it is not on dvd or vhs for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece noel coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better,1

106,this film moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the footage and coverage of dogtown affected me when i was 13 for all of those who criticized the self promotion of the z boys interviewed they have the last laugh on you that was their whole deal we're better than all of you and here's why insert footage of the smoothest pool carve imaginable this was a film to tell their story and that was their story whether you like it or not it was their opinion of their skating that mattered not yours or mine i thought the film captured their attitude and influence exactly as i remembered it in the 70's the reality is that they did revolutionize skateboarding they were the impetus behind extreme sports and they did inject a cultural paradigm that reached into every corner of americana this movie gave rebirth to images of on a wave and and jay adams ripping up the coping that was the california dream to an entire culture of young american teenagers that just wanted to have fun and get rad as i watched this film i realized that it was these images that i lived with every day until i was old enough to move out and back down to so cal after my family had moved to nor cal when i was five until i could get back my buddies and i built and thrashed ramp after ramp searched for every empty pool possible and mimicked everything covered about these guys we are all educated and have family's and careers now but this film reminds me who i was at that age and why i still surf this is an inspired film that anyone who has an interest in pop culture extreme sports the 70's or even just good documentary film making will enjoy completely whenever it comes on cable i can't change the channel kudos to stacy peralta for making a beautiful piece of art,1
107,i have vague memories of this movie being funny br br having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether br br it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones no one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human br br i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for stack and the club guys really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase,0
108,this particular title is very interesting the whole movie was like watching a ninja rpg which is really cool three magical swords three clans a horrible demon a political power has it all the animation is decent but a little grainy the story is top notch and the fight scenes are real cool one thing that really looks good in this movie are the monsters they are pretty freaky if you liked blood reign and ninja scroll is the one to see,1
109,aimless teens on summer break in a small ohio town can't find any meaningful ways to fill their time some consider driving to chicago others are content to drink and bully their peers in a random act of alcohol fueled arrogance the bullies rough up a homeless man and steal a strange book the handwritten text turns out to contain archaic spells designed to summon demonic forces a night or two later one of them reads an incantation and is quickly possessed he turns into a vicious killer and begins to quietly prey on his former peers br br demon summer is an amateur production with a microscopic budget the production values are low but the filmmakers were smart enough to not be ambitious little in the way of special props or shooting locations were needed the acting is especially weak and there is virtually nothing original in the screenplay on the positive side the special makeup effects are surprisingly good by low budget film standards despite this the gore is minimal makeup effects aside there is little going for this film even for die hard gore hounds not recommended,0
110,one minute into the untold and it s already ripped off techniques from the blair witch project and predator does this mean we ll be seeing lots of trees we sure will will we be seeing an austrian bodybuilder blowing things up well this film has the budget of a tvm so the answer is a resounding no does anyone like these soft porn shows like bedtime stories good because there s a scene in this that resembles these type of shows unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite do you like it when the screen fades to black during a tvm great because this happens between every scene in the untold in fact it happens during every scene too did you enjoy millionaire a major fraud fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major charles ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds seriously one of the characters looks like major ingram i kept expecting him to say it s bear it could be a bear but it might be a bigfoot cough cough yes it s a bigfoot cough it s definately a bigfoot cough yes i m going to shoot it final answer chris br br oh and have i mentioned that all the above are the good bits br br the untold isn t the worst bigfoot movie i ve ever seen that accolade firmly goes to night of the demon which i saw over twenty years ago and i think i ve only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time but that said the untold is still a very poor film in just about every aspect especially editing as some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while there s other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order this is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5 1 i give it 3 out of ten and i m being very kind,0
111,the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog eat dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability i've got no problem with the human side of being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft comical men the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who though exciting was extremely dangerous and fearsome br br the acting's all good and the direction very solid the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting did bugsy really want to kill,0

113,the answer no sadly not though miller and the sweep has to be hailed as a most whimsical cinematic treat the drama suspense romance and the unidentified crowd at the end all add to the films complex storyline which must have been too much for the audiences of 1898 a enlightening experience one for all the family,1
114,looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot this movie is beyond useless all the cliché's of a slasher film without any substance i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys throughout the movie you will see this br br when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend zone loser he goes ballistic and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where of course he begins to hunt them one by one sounds decent so far right but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well the plan was beyond ridiculous lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy lane's goody too shoes demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually motivating these characters to do anything they are doing it's sad this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway,0
115,i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't wait br br let me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together great show,1
116,due to its predictable second rate title the one it was distributed under in italy at least i didn't expect much from this movie thought it'd be another cheap flick about a haunted house la casa means the cursed house well i had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene the constant presence of priests and the creepy atmospheres reminded me a bit of the exorcist and some of its decent italian rip offs but this was going to be something completely different this is more like hitchcock meets italian thriller very well written and directed good actors interesting plot ok i've tried not to spoil the viewing of 7 park for you which i'd highly recommend to everyone br br p s am i wrong or when joanna crawls or tries hard to stand she's paralyzed from the waist down her feet and legs move a little too much and i'm not talking of the bad dream sequence,1
117,the name lucio fulci up images of graphic death and mutilation in the minds of may fans thanks to movies like zombi 2 city of the living dead the beyond and the new york ripper fulci has a reputation for being one of the goriest directors in history and although many of his later movies certainly justify his reputation until the release of zombi 2 in 1979 fulci's films did not contain anywhere near the amount of blood and guts he's know for in fact they were for the most part gore free instead relying on more traditional shocks and disturbing imagery to work don't torture a duckling hardly contains any gore yet ranks as his best br br don't torture a duckling is set in a small sicilian town where superstition rules instead of logic the townsfolk are very distrustful of outsiders as well as anyone different often shunning them after a series of child murders though many people descend upon the town including andrea thomas milan who tries to uncover the truth about the murders while they continue to happen br br this is a remarkable film it's very well made with an excellent cast filled with many favorites of italian exploitation cinema it also contains a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or lucio fulci but the real draw of don't torture a duckling is the disturbing nature of the movie little kids around twelve years old are shown mocking retarded people visiting prostitutes and being propositioned sex by an older woman it also contains some very biting commentary on the middle class and the catholic church it is for reasons like this that don't torture a duckling was blacklisted throughout europe when it was first released and never was shown in the united states still don't torture a duckling stands as a monumental achievement in giallo cinema as well as lucio fulci's best work i really can't recommend this one enough check it out,1

119,to be honest the movie was so horrible that i loved it never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie i was in shock i mean i don't even know what to say br br the characters couldn't even keep their own guns one minute a guy had an and his friend had an mp5 then in the next scene they switched guns don't ask trust me i know my guns and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam to an arizona highway to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in california that is what i took from it br br why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you how is that frightening i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie i love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day but hey whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants br br good day,0
120,another stinker from the pm entertainment group and thankfully one of their last br br is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the towering i don't mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them there is no effort whatsoever in is stars who is an absolutely terrible actor seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps the special fx are just rubbish shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i've ever seen the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera on top of that there is not one character you actually root for you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up br br the script is embarrassing the red are signposted well in advance someone else has mentioned this but 'the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire the building with his broom hilarious or same janitor going into a room marked material' were these scenes supposed to be tongue in cheek somehow i doubt it br br the one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the film i can't recommend it watch 'the towering instead br br 3 10,0
121,all the airport movies are stinkers but this one is the biggest turkey of them all the formula was different for this one because it focused on two disastrous flights and a lot of plot occurring on the ground while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground the stunts with the concorde are worth watching for the laughs although the special effects aren't as terrible as i'd expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979 george kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in paris is totally unnecessary and made me gag a little poor martha raye was relegated to a role where she did nothing but relieve her bowel over and over in the bathroom there are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films giving you one more reason not to watch this one,0
122,this royal rumble basically had the message of wrestling these days gimmick and image are more popular then wrestling ability br br hbk vs edge pretty good match a lot of heat for edge who was just starting out as a heel again and what better way to go into a match with hbk it kind of got a little slower at the end then usual overall this match gets a 6 10 undertaker vs not a good match undertaker had to carry through this match who seemed to be really lost and screwed up his moves it did get interesting to see gene and a bit later kane come into this match overall the fans seemed more interested when this match ended 2 10 kurt angle vs jbl vs big show this match was slow at first but got pretty good at the end when angle managed to speed up the match kurt angle did some really good wrestling moves and proves he is the best wrestler out of the match jbl and big show put on a slow match the ending to this match was bad over all this match was a 5 10 because of kurt angle randy orton vs hhh good match surprising heat for randy orton who was the face in this match randy proved he can go the limit with any top star this match also marked the first match hhh has wrestled where someone dosn't run down and save him from a loss over all this match was about a 6 10 br br royal rumble match was ok some surprises some not so good surprises i was kind of upset that kurt angle wasn't given enough time in this match but over all this match had a guy who i never thought would be pushed so soon i won't tell ya who wins i give this match a 8 10,1
123,the cast is admirably chosen and well balanced this cinematography is excellent the music is delightful as all of burt music is and is appropriate to the plot line making a musical version of hilton's tale is a welcome change from a plodding re make we see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene i cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of a film it is a treasure of the silver screen find it if you can and let its magic carry you beyond the drudgery of daily worries inspiring you to find your own lost horizon,1
124,where to start i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb and all of those were positive as for this br br mind blowingly hideously tragically embarrassingly catastrophically stupidly irritatingly completely and utterly beyond awful br br i am stunned this got made never mind given a theatrical release i think i am literally in shock br br i'm no snob i didn't expect beautiful film making or intense character depth but this is truly beyond a joke we simply must demand more from the films we see br br avoid like the black death,0
125,very suspenseful surprisingly intelligent film about five medical students themselves and then being to share their experiences of death and what lies beyond joel schumacher directs with some skill creating some very eerie scenes as well as particularly beautiful ones the visions of death are not what viewers might expect nor is that which awaits us all when we go thanks to screenwriter peter who really did an outstanding job coming up with this story while the creativity of the story is impressive the story has many holes as well particularly in the logic department and believability factors notwithstanding all of that is a good effective film because of the script the direction which again is very surreal at times and the acting which brings four very talented actors and william baldwin together this core of actors acts and reacts off each other very nicely keifer sutherland does a very impressive job as the head of the group the one who comes up with the idea to die and be born again he also manages to portray a man a young man with a damaging destructive secret from his past kevin bacon is fine as the most pragmatic and skeptical of the group oliver platt is really good as the voice of reason and human fears platt has some really good lines and plays the paranoia well yes julia roberts is here too and very good the actors do best though by playing off each other and making us believe they are such good friends i was duly impressed with much of but more than anything else the story affected me the most the scene with that dog hobbling around the street just one of those powerful images evoked as were many of the flashback scenes,1
126,i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd the director's cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and war shooting blood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg 13 br br other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of andrew's voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable,1
127,super troopers was an instant classic club dread while disappointing to many had its moments puddle has fewer moments i saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store and saw at the bottom that it was made by the broken lizard group who made super troopers so naturally i picked it up i only found one scene to be laugh out loud funny a far cry from super troopers all in all i was very disappointed i would not recommend this to anyone unless you have an abundance of free time and really need to kill some time however you're better off playing video games or watching something that might make you laugh or think,0
128,my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out br br there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time br br this is the only movie i have ever walked out on br br it was just painful to sit through br br the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund br br never had that happen before or since do not rent this you will really regret it i am really by the vote summary perhaps personal has something to do with it,0
129,my mother frank begins as a warm amiable comedy about a middle aged catholic woman frank short for francis played by cusack who shakes herself out of the doldrums by as a student in her son's university most of her friends and family are horrified not least her son matthew newton who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend rose byrne meanwhile frank has raised the ire of her disapproving english tutor sam neill br br matthew newton is utterly disarming as david relaxed and natural in the role even when the character's uptight he generates valuable goodwill steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward broad comedy moments not long after the half way point first time writer director mark expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives cusack a real chance to shine br br the supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces sacha nicholas bishop and all the principals including a more animated than usual sam neill are excellent while it meanders a little towards the end my mother frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine australian crowd pleaser,1
130,i have a question for the writers and producers of prozac nation what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer but this is not a story of success only one of self destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her the film examines divorce family dysfunction drugs alcohol and prescription medication as possible reasons for liz's unhappiness but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory br br at some point in the film it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in the united states of depression in the story liz had a caring therapist anne heche a caring roommate michele williams a caring boyfriend jason biggs and a troubled but caring parent jessica lange in a key scene in the film liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break up of the space shuttle challenger instead of equating challenger with liz's life the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery br br this film reminded me of a generic made for cable victim film on the lifetime network an excellent cast was wasted especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci the real life elizabeth obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit,0
131,this derivative erotic thriller remains watchable most of the way mainly because a viewer is casually curious about how it will turn out and because the director peter hall manages to stage a pretty hot and quite bold sex scene but the finale though unexpected is preposterous and the whole plotting complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders reveals itself to be unbearably cliched especially as far as motivation is concerned 1 2,0
132,admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero bond and villain were seriously miscast is too big and innocent looking to play bond he looks and acts more like the good natured but dim witted sidekick in a police action movie the director and writer try to establish his credibility but his saying of lines like royal north of the just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue savalas doesn't do a bad job but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor this movie is too long 140 mins for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until bond's mountain escape where it begins to pick up this film tries very hard but falls short many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one,0
133,bon voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the so called phony war and later the french flight from paris ahead of the german onslaught yet bon voyage is not a war movie it is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times bon voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of french reactions to the new political order this film is a comedy which entertains the audience a romance which skillfully utilizes many clichés and a story of a handful of people whose nation is collapsing around them,1
134,okay that was just brilliant i wish that the rest of season 1 had been this strong it really needed more episodes like this br br the cast worked perfectly even though they were all nobodies back in the day writing was fantastic and so was the editing great job in all accounts br br the episode was thrilling suspenseful and just kept you guessing until the very end which is what most episodes had tried but failed until now br br the first five star episode for me really good almost like a movie i didn't even remember it being this good i think it's even better than the great horror movie called 'the thing',1
135,jack lemmon and walter matthau have got to be one of the best buddies ever to work together they have made lots of movies together i think they are both fantastic when they do work together in a movie out to sea is a fantastic comedy movie i think to watch i give the movie 10 out of 10 jack lemmon and walter matthau will be remembered when the movies they did together will be on tv they will be sadly missed god bless you both,1
136,yes it was an awful movie but there was a song near the beginning of the movie i think called i got a woody or something to that effect i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available i saw this song on mst 3k and as awful as it was it had it's moments and that song was one of them br br if you like babes in bikinis this is the movie for you but if you don't then don't bother it was great material for mst 3k i have to admit though i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though not just that song but a couple more were really funny and are classics as far as i'm concerned,0
137,this movie was really bad first they didn't even follow the facts for it half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed victims the acting was horrible except for the guy playing ed gein but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos that was the best part of the movie as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill the writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didn't need to be the story of ed gein is interesting enough without falsifying information,0
138,how this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me the test that postal workers take is so difficult there is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie how they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling i didn't take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid then he tries to start the car without his keys lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all it's just a sad stupid mess i liked the moms dress though br br send it back to sender as soon as possible,0
139,a lot of people don't think dan aykroyd is funny this movie proves otherwise aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one liners in this comedy the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud the doctor goes nuts like doctor leo marvin richard dreyfuss in what about bob the scenes where the doctor is desperately trying to get back to los angeles are silly unbelievable and unfunny other that this aspect the movie really is funny especially the first half,1
140,absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story told with unflinching eye and with gripping style if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people this could change your mind something for you feds too a good model for government coverups if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you,1
141,in the mood for love a teasing allegory of loneliness and longing here is a film without sex or even kissing and it is no doubt one of the sexiest and definetly the most thought provoking and psychological romance i have ever seen br br telling the story of two people who coincidentally live in the same apartment and are a door away from each other the film like and unlike random hearts is about how two people come together via the affair of their two lovers only once they receive this news they take the time to think about the consequences of an affair and each other's feelings towards having just broken up and whether or not the two people are willing enough to fall back in love br br what's terrific about the film is the way director wong kar wai presents each character's way of dealing with loneliness with maggie cheung's character he'll show her in a repeated montage leaving work going home watching her neighbors gamble head to the noodle shop leave the noodle shop and bump into her attractive age equal played by tony leung this is a clever if not subtle and knowing technique to present loneliness for it is when you are alone when you find yourself falling into a loop this movie worked for me because i can identify with that feeling,1
142,is the princess bride meets well trainspotting but wait really it's a good combination this was definitely one of the better movies i've seen in a long time it has the kind of witty dialog i associate with the princess bride or cemetery man along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie the heroic feel of princess bride combined with the this is odd lack of any really good guys that trainspotting had br br i'm not saying it was as good as the princess bride but it was in the arena and it rocked some of the dialog transcends pleasing to brilliant the plot is interesting the characters while slightly are not due to their intrinsic nature there were flamboyantly gay people in the 18th century contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks but just in a bit of the language they used the anachronisms made it fun though and not cheesy and easily dismissed br br if you've ever read any simon r green or cook's garrett series you know exactly what this movie is check it out it's great,1
143,a movie this dumb should never see the light of day the acting is lame the violence is just all over the place the sneaking ending is just plain stupid br br it's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r i c c o squad no one has never seen him not even the hit men themselves so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r i c c o squad before they find them br br then the movie goes on to a romance gun shooting and voodoo now how in the hell did voodoo come in this never see this film if your life depends on it trust me,0
144,someone asked why it was canceled i tell you why because reality makes money the show surface was canceled so that they could replace it with a reality show this will haunt nbc i and about half of my high school about 1000 people total have vowed to boycott nbc until they bring this show back in my area i don't know about other places but they had a great thing going with the sci fi channel where the sci fi channel would show last weeks episode at 7 00 and then nbc would show the week's new episode at 8 00 this was great because it gave you a little refresher as to what happened in the last episode i was so angry when i learned that the show was canceled and they were going to just leave them on top of the church like that,1
145,this movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims' parents without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents and the christian vision of all the questions implied we must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed legal way,1
146,crack house 1989 was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre what's supposed to be an anti drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white exploitation exercise in depravity there's nothing wrong with that however the video presentation even has an anti drug message from one of the stars of the show richard turncoat roundtree br br the movie follows two young lovers in high school one of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl one of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex friends jim brown appears as the movie's mister big he's one bad dude who still can punk out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word luke from general hospital makes a guest star spot as well br br if you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you sadly hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do it's neither exploitative nor entertaining br br recommended for sleaze fans,1
147,warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham handed with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans we don't run from trouble we face up to our responsibilities it also suggests that if you're willing to yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters you're un american walter huston looking bored is the frustrated da and the average american family includes such familiar faces as sally blane looking a lot like her sister loretta young and dickie moore as an allegedly adorable moppet both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran ponderously jumping and amusingly at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans his st dance old coot performance is tiresome schtick it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it william wellman directs efficiently and quickly much like his earlier public enemy but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout i e they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob,0
148,seriously i thought it was a spoof when i saw it at the rental store but i realized it was just crap i can't even believe i didn't shut it off like we all know those snakes weren't they were pythons and gardner's the acting was lame and i still cant believe the ending loll if your gonna watch it just watch it for the end it was seriously priceless way better then 6th sense i don't even know if the makers of the movie actually thought this title would fly the only time it is really going to fly is when i throw it in the garbage just watch it for a laugh it was hilarious in the stupidest way don't buy just rent,0
149,beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesn't really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them don't bother if you want simple entertainment this not for you br br i could about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i won't if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film,1
150,although allegedly autobiographical this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology resulting in a flat fragmented characterization as well as into larger scale historical processes and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled instead i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent and whose the movie quite blatantly seeks the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass media market as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk ideologies i e a crowd pleaser br br what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation genuinely minimalistic imagery which nevertheless always kept the screen rich expressive and unambiguous no small for which i do give it some stars,0
151,in 1850 in yorkshire a boy chimney sweep is falsely accused of theft by his crooked master and runs away he falls into a treacherous local river and is transported into an underwater realm where he makes many friends and rescues the mythical water babies from an evil shark br br based on a book by charles kingsley this is a lovely children's film half live action and half animation which is both a grim and evocative depiction of victorian times and a terrifically enjoyable undersea adventure it really is two films in one which somehow complement each other and combine into a much richer whole the animation by tony cuthbert jack and is wonderful as is the photography by ted and the music by phil coulter and bill martin has a great rough diamond quality as the literal fish out of water i love the moment when he's on top of the mansion sees all the chimneys and shouts blimey at the top of his voice mason and cribbins are the filthiest nastiest bullies you could hope to see in a costume drama if you want to see real victorian values don't watch sense and sensibility watch this and whitelaw pertwee who does umpteen voices and percival are all excellent this is how a good children's movie should be good old fun but also just a little bit thoughtful sad and frightening high,1
152,well the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion yes chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job like my friend ryan i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend until than the killer had only killed women oh well i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought definitly a film you can pass on,0
153,dodgy plot dodgy script dodgy almost everything in fact the most compelling performance is that of joanna pacula as lauren but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film the director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement br br presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others don't go out of your way to see it,0
154,is less funny and less interesting than any episode of dobie gillis where is their bob denver do they even have a dwayne hickman a french man moves to barcelona to attend classes he moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself and they do and say uninteresting things this movie is unbelievably bland the only bright spot was a pretty french girl who played a belgian lesbian she places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven not the usual of dark smelly hair but bare armpits does not a good movie make was funny so was la cage aux and le placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with french comedy,0
155,i first saw it at january 1 2009 and after a day i watched it again and i want to watch it again love everything well almost so 9 stars about it no color beautiful naive stories funny gangsters anna camera work music well sometimes you just want to listen little bit longer and the music just stops but this is not a musical after all i like anna's acting this naive wannabe gangster girl how she speaks holds the gun everything makes me smile no it's not that funny though i have laughed a bit at some moments it's just so subtle excellent work by samuel though 3d nouvelle seems weaker but they are also gangsters maybe even worse cause they are stealing ideas and the last scene is my favorite makes me feel so warm and romantic yes i would recommend this movie for the romantic souls with a taste for such art movies and i don't agree with those comparing it to pulp fiction it's not about action and twisted story though all vignettes intersect it's calm and maybe too slow movie for most of the people it's about characters their feelings very subtle anyway probably this review won't be of much help to anyone my first just wanted to express my appreciation br br spoiler this movie doesn't have a goofs section wonder didn't anybody notice that hand in the 2 part when the kidnappers decided to go home looks like a part of crew hehe i know i should better post this in forums but i don't agree with some policies here,1
156,i have only seen this movie once when i was about 14 years old but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the division being from oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the i would like to see it released on a dvd i may sound a little bias but the division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today the history channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about ww2 and korea but you rarely hear it mention the one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language i am glad that all of the native american code are getting the recognition they deserve,0
157,the copy of this movie that i have seen is not very good it's grainy and has almost no color in some parts it switches back and forth between english and french often in mid sentence and sometimes even in the middle of a word to make matters much worse there are no english subtitles during the french language parts which i think make up at least one quarter of the film but amazingly the movie is still very understandable and enjoyable even in this condition and i think that says a lot about how well made this film is br br this is a top notch spaghetti western with great acting an interesting storyline and an excellent music score it also has a cool protagonist a beautiful dark haired girl some strange characters and events and an overall feeling of melancholy this film has euro written all over it br br i hope there is a pristine negative or print of this film out there somewhere because it deserves a quality dvd release and when it comes out i will be one of the first in line to get it,1
158,this film is absolutely appalling and awful it's not low budget it's a no budget film that makes ed wood's movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge italian taste maybe even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really discerning this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny just boring and extremely cheap it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this,0
159,did people expect jurassic park 3 to be full of surprises not one moment of it is worth it many elements could easily scare people out of the movies and it's not the dinos tea leoni i think she's a great actress but i'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie laura dern she's ok but why not be more noticeable in the movie maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil alessandro nivola have you ever heard of something called facial expression emotions he's got to work harder on that sam neil no big deal the soundtrack got to change that record or you get tired of it my applause goes to william h macy a talented actor who i've never seen playing a bad role unfortunately he can't save the movie nor can the well computer created dinosaurs,0
160,a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isn't called snake island because it's just soooooo much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which ain't anything couldn't see in a pg13 rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out but don't torture yourself with this crap,0
161,if we consider three films with a similar subject which are this one which was made in 1930 'the covered made in 1923 and made in 1950 the distance between 'the big and 'the covered is only 7 years whereas the distance between 'the big and is 20 years this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those 7 years and how in the next 20 years the changes were slow to come 'the big trail is technically close to but ages apart from 'the covered the story is about the pioneers going from the missouri to the west in oregon tyrone power sr is the man leading the caravan he is a rough and mean guy john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to marguerite churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her raoul walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west he directed 'the tall men' in 1955 which has a lot in common with 'the big,1
162,charles chic sales is absolutely terrific as the sole member of the family willing to testify against a gangster they saw murder a policeman and an informant he fought at bull run in the civil war and his patriotism runs high even after his son in law is beaten and one of his grandson's is kidnapped by the gang intimidating all the other members fear of his grandson's death is no excuse he says he wouldn't want his grandson living in a country run by gangsters anyway the conflict between civic duty and personal safety is driven home sharply in this oscar nominated story walter huston is also a standout as the hard driving district attorney threatening the family with perjury if they don't back up their identification of the killer in court the rest of the cast including the sleazy killer ralph ince are all excellent and the film is snappily directed by william a wellman there's also good suspense as sales disappears just as the trial is about to begin,1
163,based on a ray bradbury story a professional photographer brian kerwin returns to his modest home near a tiny desert town where most of the citizens wishes he stayed away a lonely boy jonathan latches onto him for the attention and the two witness the landing of an alien craft in the rocky region of the desert the aliens turn themselves into the images of townspeople kerwin must convince evacuation of the town and falls in love with the young boy's mother elizabeth pena acting is pretty shallow the story line is no worse than some others this movie leaves you feeling that you got shorted on a decent ending supporting cast includes howard morris dean norris and mickey jones,0

165,this movie sucks so bad its funny to see what a poor story this has where two pea brained american twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there its just so stupid and so bizarre how can they just find two french guys hit on them and in the end kiss them not knowing anything about them more realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them which could have easily happened in such a situation as for the bit where they make the french president drink 'bad water' that was just lame i don't think he would have been too pleased in real life everything worked out too easily for the girls and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie if it at all depicted real life br br my rating 0 10,0
166,spoiler alert i worked as an extra on this lifetime tv movie filmed in seattle it's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie because usually they are still in the process of either still writing parts as was the case here or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts br br my husband and i both worked as extras in this movie and i recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end frankly i never thought margaret colin's character really got adequate punishment for her crime of hit and run lying to police covering up etc could you imagine how the ending would have had to change if she had ended up killing the hit and run victim instead of her ending up coming out of her coma okay just something to think about br br by the way i play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often we've counted four times margaret colin was great to work with and very down to earth although lisa vidal now a lifetime regular was aloof br br overall the movie turned out to be about a 7 10 but like another poster commented is still a real tear jerker and makes a great saturday afternoon cable flick,1
167,if you loved the 1993 erotic sci fiction cyborg film nemesis then you'll love this one i loved it the minute the elvis hero pulls out a samurai sword during a shoot out like nemesis its takes place in a post apocalyptic slum of the future both are police thrillers where the well armed hero must take on well armed rebels to solve a conspiracy by the powers that be against the unwashed masses but thats where the similarities ends the ambiguous mayor in dead or alive tries to keep the masses sedate on the drugs he sells them the rebels aided by mercenaries and a cyborg try to brake his suffocating hold on his subjects after several failed attempts to brake the rebels back he sends his top cop to assassinate the rebels this movie follows the track of most action adventure but isn't afraid to color outside the line,1
168,not many television shows appeal to quite as many different kinds of fans like farscape does i know youngsters and 30 40 years old fans both male and female in as many different countries as you can think of that just adore this t v miniseries it has elements that can be found in almost every other show on t v character driven drama that could be from an australian soap opera yet in the same episode it has science fact fiction that would give even the hardiest trekkie a run for his money in the stakes wormhole theory time travel in true form magnificent it embraces cultures from all over the map as the possibilities are endless having multiple stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from br br with such a broad scope it would be expected that nothing would be able to keep up the illusion for long but here is where farscape really comes into it's own element it succeeds where all others have failed especially the likes of star trek a universe with practically zero element they ran out of ideas pretty quickly kept rehashing them over the course of 4 seasons they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character evolution with multiple threads to every episode with unique personal touches to camera that are specific to certain character groups within the whole this structure allows for an extremely large area of subject matter as loyalties are forged and broken in many ways on many many issues i happened to see the pilot premiere in passing and just had to keep tuning in after that to see if crichton would ever get the girl after seeing them all on television i was delighted to see them available on dvd i have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me sane whilst i had to do a 12 hour night shift and developed chronic insomnia farscape was the only thing to get me through those extremely long nights br br do yourself a favour watch the pilot and see what i mean br br farscape comet,1
169,though predictable and contrived not a bad movie it entertains which is all van damme hopes to do the omnipresent twin device is again used as in a large number of van damme's movies but it is not bothersome except to long time fans natasha is gorgeous and worth watching action is decent nothing spectacular for van damme but exciting i can recommend to van damme fans and even to those who aren't but don't mind an action film with a good looking lead couple the russian mob is a nice concept and topical for the day clearly not his best film but by no means his worst,0
170,i liked this movie i'm not a big horror movie buff so i couldn't comment on similarities between this and other movies of this genre but i found this movie quite captivating the story line albeit a little obvious had some genuinely scary tense moments and the acting of the lead female role wasn't bad in anyway br br overall i'm a little surprised at the low rating this movie has gotten i watch a lot of movies working in a video store tends to help and this really isn't as bad as people seem to think i do have some criticism though the final call from the cop was terrible almost overacted the dead girl in the bathroom looked liked she was having a little sleep probably from the amount of tequila she mentioned she drank and the children's reaction to what was happening instilled in me the hope that they were ultimately killed br br hope this helps some people,1
171,stanwyck at her villainous best robinson her equal as ruthless land in this fairly ordinary western br br some good action scenes strong use of location colour and cinemascope but why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene br br ford is dependable as always and foster is strong as robinson's daughter but it is the baddies' film and it's not just stanwyck and robinson brian keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as stanwyck's lover and richard jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold hearted killer br br see it for the camp value,1
172,i'll make this brief this was a joy to watch it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable the visuals were most stunning except for the second rate cg scenes which could have been left out i dislike computer generated animation anyways it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one watch it you will appreciate it too,1
173,this fantasy was utter garbage i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti government movies but this one was far worse than anything he ever did no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism this movie is a left wing greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made i'm sure it will do well in syria iran pakistan and north korea though it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent there is anyone in the u k who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement,0
174,distant is a slice of turkish life flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever there's little doubt that auteur bilge is a work in progress with considerable talent however this little foreign minimalistic arty is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere i personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fast forwarding through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue plot development and denouement distant is a very nicely done bit of b,1
175,i've seen a few movies in my time but this one is exceptional you'll have to watch it more than once to truly appreciate it it is emotionally very complex it explores love and passion at it's most extreme and it's cinematography is just breathtaking the character of the count is intensely passionate and tragic without him having to raise his voice or indeed leave his bed the film is perfectly cast and perfectly acted the film has a sort of mathematical precision and perfection to it which is rare these days it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one this movie is unmissable all the hype surrounding it and all the awards cannot begin to do it any justice hats off to michael for writing the incredible book on which it is based,1

177,when patricia newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder detective searches the city for her killer identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country for the case is closed or is it blood relatives is an overlooked masterpiece donald sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see donald pleasance in a small role as a child molester the conclusion is pretty disturbing still blood relatives is more of a mystery than a horror film so fans of gore will be disappointed a must see for fans of old fashioned mystery movies 9 out of 10,1
178,i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be cool but looking back now 45 years it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value granted the special effects do well on t v with the series that started in 1964 but for the big screen i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the obviously not well staged or trained overall it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it for fun laughs sake this was probably one of irwin allen's biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it eden went on to play genie on t v micheal was her husband now that is a cool part about this film i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie neat,0
179,i'm from ireland and i thought this film had the odd minute or two where accents where a little off but no worse than any brad pitt or other american doing the accent furthermore i have rarely seen any british actor handle an american or canadian accent except for colin farrel in minority report this film is a little film and it was entertaining no it wasn't a blockbuster hollywood production but frankly i'm sick of that shite i laughed more than a few times and had a good time it was definitely worth the rental the main character is a spoof on other hard british gangsters at least that's the way i saw it if you go in expecting a 100 million dollar production you'll be disappointed enjoy it for what it is a small entertaining film,1
180,i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense br br all in all i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts but they are repetitive i felt like i was watching a loop trailer seems like it was a short film shot with different actors br br in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hype the excessive length killed the thrill br br unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies wich i thought i was don't waste your time on this one,0
181,this movie is so cool it told me to enjoy every moment in life to its i think that bonnie hunt jerry maguire writes well and i am so happy that she gave aging actors opportunity to have such big roles in the movie that is really neat in a society that worships wealth health and youth it was nice to see a movie about normal people the movie reminded me a lot of while you were sleeping which i really love if you don't like this movie you should work on your sensitivity skills br br favorite quotes megan dayton i'm just saying for safety don't shave your legs because then you definitely won't let it go too far grace briggs megan it's a first date megan dayton i married a first date i'm sure you plan on being level headed but once you're in the moment the male brain seems i don't know everything they say suddenly seems brilliant hairy legs are your only link to reality favorite scenes megan good will hunting riding her bike all the scenes in the garden the conversation and comradery among the grandpa and friends in the restaurant please do not miss this movie it will warm up your heart,1
182,i actually first watched one dark night in the theater wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper i loved it then i still love it the storyline revolves around two people first of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death she then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death the he's buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her dare her to stay in the all night to join their group they go back in the night to scare her find scares for themselves the cast is led by meg tilly with supporting roles by adam west and one of my personal favorites elizabeth daily aka e g daily check this one out if you love 80's movies cheesy horror movies you won't be,1

184,i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks br br what this was probably the worst asian horror movie i've seen br br spoilers there were just so many fundamental problems with the story a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary with notable exceptions ringu and ju on this is the case here except they aren't scary a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all the monk character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life nothing scary there either but the woman just doesn't get it she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever br br that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle first she rides a taxi with a ghost ghosts ride taxis that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy right after that at the bus stop well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up br br all in all this movie is a total bomb i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images,0
185,victor silent film masterpiece the phantom carriage has recently been released on dvd with a new soundtrack recorded by the duo comprising american guitarist stephen and austrian laptop artist peter has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921 an ominous banging sound introduces each act and a medley of drones guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds br br as impressive as the new soundtrack is the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale according to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on new year's eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage collecting the souls of the dead this is the fate of the anti hero of the film david holm who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage br br this film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others gives a remarkable performance as the drunken spiteful and menacing holm in life and the wretched frightened holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds br br striking imagery abounds throughout the phantom carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue the ill onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon equally impressively the dead are depicted through pioneering semi transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch br br film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by is a superb accentuation of its themes this is a must see,1
186,george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit com man about the house though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish family a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags br br having seen this big screen version of the show i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like br br did he give it to you br br no that's the first time a man has resisted my charms br br i meant the envelope br br you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples who never wrote an episode for the original sit com has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it,0
187,it couldn't br br from the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to behold throughout the immediate feel for the bitterness of the antarctic the affinity for the characters that is built up at the base level before the real action heats up and the cunning finale combine to make this one of the most memorable and enjoyable films around br br up against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors from another planet the thing comes out on top and laughing who can forget the perfectly timed dialogue and the chilling special effects special effects that are a lot more impressive than the computer generated images that we get to see today i for one found some of the most enjoyable aspects of the film to be the way that we were introduced slowly to each member of the crew and the way that they all had some distinctive character traits this wasn't just a senseless bloodbath come slasher horror flick this film had feeling emotion br br i truly can't recommend this film highly enough i have yet to see anything in it's class that comes anywhere near to matching let alone bettering the near perfect acting and timing utilised in this cunning feat of cinema,1
188,if this film is an accurate display of j acting skills i think he made a big mistake leaving television hasn't he watched any films starring david caruso especially cold around the heart along the lines of acting ability what about mary louise she has done much much better yes it is a terrible script ineptly edited and totally lacking in continuity but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles a very big disappointment,0
189,i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo philharmonic and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me particularly the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself a bit of strategy ripped off thoroughly by the makers of king arthur in 2004 also the battle goes on forever half an hour painfully long i can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding i'm surprised stalin liked this film so well i wouldn't want to go out and fight after watching it,1
190,these days ridley scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies especially since he has films like alien gladiator and blade runner to his credit so from this partial list of his credits it's obvious he's an amazing talent however if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness that's because although it has some nice camera work and style the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving however considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground then i am disposed to looking at it charitably hence the score of 4 br br by the way this film is part of the cinema 16 european shorts dvd on this dvd are 16 shorts most aren't great though because it contains the man without a head copy shop rabbit and wasp it's an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying,0
191,i'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials but in this case the film's neglect appears justified evidently based on some actual incidents during wwii the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me one very likely reason is that in the print i saw on tcm anyway none of the scenes where the germans talked among themselves were given titles this interesting directorial concept to let the non german speaking viewer just guess from context what the germans are saying to each other is in my book an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out also the way the movie begins just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup is disorienting brian keith is pretty good here but the reputations of the great escape and stalag 17 will not be challenged by this flick,0
192,a bland title disguises this solidly example of old fashioned hollywood entertainment this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements a period piece a romantic drama a crime movie and a political thriller interestingly though made by fox its protagonists  robert taylor and barbara stanwyck  were both usually associated with other studios their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years' time while a bit too young taylor is a dashing hero a marine personally appointed by president mckinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean up of numerous banks unsurprisingly no sooner has he tracked them down led by smooth brian donlevy and thuggish victor mclaglen that he falls for a chanteuse naturally stanwyck who has thrown her lot with the gang  although truth be told singing is far from being the actress' forte similarly apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold he has to vie with mclaglen for stanwyck's attentions by the way the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of charley chase in sons of the desert 1933 which incidentally was likewise directed by william a later on taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl  but the jealous rival disrupts his plans the robbery gone awry we find donlevy dead and the other two in jail taylor's hopes for intervention  having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent 'inside man'  are seemingly dashed when the president winds up assassinated himself a great plot twist though the resulting eleventh hour suspense feels contrived to get back to the film's jumble of styles even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste the romantic triangle slows things up and it somewhat on the thriller aspect this emerges a handsome production indeed  with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of john carradine who unaccountably disappears after just one scene douglas sig and as two american presidents sidney the bubbly theodore roosevelt and frank conroy mckinley,1
193,it's not just that the movie is lame it's more than that this movie is just unnecessary do we need another western how about a western with afro americans in the titles roles sound stupid implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre it is incredibly lame and simple minded it's like that lame baz film romeo and juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his of a classic tale well baz failed miserably and so does this mess the story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro american cast is racist in itself it's also puerile and simple minded like baz man he's a bad director hey i hear you say this was directed by mario van peebles he's also in the film how can it be racist it's not i said the idea of casting all afro americans instead of caucasians was the film isn't racist it's just pointless stupid and very very boring,0
194,if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off pop in this movie the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes aside from that prepare for some sweet it boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies i've ever seen now if you will excuse me i will finish my nap,0
195,this was a very good ppv but like wrestlemania xx some 14 years later the wwe crammed so many matches on it some of the matches were useless i'm not going to go through every match on the card because it would take forever to do br br however major highlights included the huge pop for demolition winning the tag team belts from haku and andre the giant the first ever mixed tag match featuring randy savage and sensational queen sherri vs dusty rhodes and the late sapphire and the first ever clash between the ultimate warrior and hulk hogan br br some matches were a complete waste of time like the bolsheviks vs the hart foundation was only about 40 seconds long koko b ware vs rick martel was short and big bossman vs akeem was too short br br mr perfect vs brutus beefcake and ted dibiase vs jake 'the snake' roberts were very good indeed br br overall grade b,1
196,when you watch low budget horror movies as much as i do you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie as each film maker adds his own flavor to the cheese such is the case with jack o when i watched this truly awful movie i was left with the undeniable feeling that fred olen ray was involved maybe not as director but in some fashion and as i researched i found that i was correct only fred and a of others could write something this pathetic and this movie just reeked of fred olen ray unless you like fred olen ray and god only knows why anyone would avoid this movie if you're going to rent an olen ray pic rent hollywood chainsaw hookers it's the only bright shining star in olen ray's dark cheesey universe of terrible movies,0
197,this is a silly spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist michael cain is called upon to an autobiography of a colorful waning hollywood star mickey rooney at times silliness becomes obnoxious this is not cain at his best rooney is way over the top notable support from lizabeth scott lionel and the comely nadia cassini not easy to watch,0
198,well what do you know i was painting my house today and an elton john song came on the radio which immediately took me back to this movie which i saw in 1971 so long ago and so far away ten years later i hitched through the country side of france and i sure would have been keen to see michelle the film is probably not very sophisticated by todays standards more's the pity but it seemed rather racy back then a few years later a sequel was made with michelle living in a high rise in paris and paul coming back to meet her just like life they had moved on the film was very downbeat still the original was fab and if you can get a copy go rent it just remember to give it its' due and treat it gently i note americans can be rather prudish so take note contains scenes and themes possibly upsetting to middle america,1
199,watchable but pretty terrible how shocking that this was the great gregory la last directing credit even in his better known roles i don't care for gene kelly he seems to me to be smug hostile and self involved here paired with a minor actress like marie wilson he seems to show those characteristics in spades br br marie wilson playing an heiress who falls for a military man is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard disagreeable core of the picture and they do ok br br the know it all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which franklin pangborn was famous and in which despite their stereotyping he was generally funny unlike this guy phyllis thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot,0
200,so this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea goes on and on with tension carey in a good untypical role but in a less than you expected performance weak direction from joel schumacher match with some plot holes the detective scenes show us the luck of creativity if you don't have great expectations because of the negative reviews maybe you will enjoy this at the end they offer to us a lesson about morality for those who remember falling down and the family joy and cure that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable p s it's obvious who is the killer i wonder why w sparrow carey didn't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film,0
201,the college teacher larry donner billy cristal is a blocked writer since his former wife kate mulgrew ruined him stealing his novel that became a best seller he does not hide his hatred for upsetting his girlfriend beth ryan kim greist who is an anthropologist teacher in the same college while giving classes of creative writing he is stalked by the student owen danny devito that wants to know his opinion about his crime tale larry tells that he did not like it and explains that in every mystery tale the murderer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi otherwise he would get caught further larry suggests owen to watch hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of a suspenseful story owen who wants to kill his detestable mother anne ramsey watches strangers on a train and misunderstands larry's advice believing that his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive owen travels to hawaii and while in a ship falls overboard vanishing in the sea and is considered dead however larry does not have an alibi and becomes the prime suspect while the deranged owen presses him to kill his mother as part of their supposed deal br br throw momma from the train is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to alfred hitchcock the direct reference is strangers on a train but there are jokes with vertigo with the spinning camera family plot with the car without breaks and other movies the lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when larry tells that every great romance or mystery has a train anne ramsey is amazing in the role of a nasty and abusive dominating mother and the viewer will certainly feel sorrow and understand the insanity of owen kim greist is very beautiful and kate mulgrew is the perfect bitch billy cristal performs an obsessed character with many silly and unreasonable attitudes but necessary to the plot my vote is seven br br title brazil a do throw momma from the train,1
202,forgive me but this work of director peter hall is horrendous if you can't get to us with the plot why not kill someone's cat or dog that surely reaches the audiences this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie and believe me i saw it coming before she opened the package how predictable can you get take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way i have never been a fan of de and this performance tells me why overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation i found her rather silly and definitely boring i did like banderas but felt bad that he had to play opposite de he has done much better in other films namely philadelphia where he had some honesty in his dialogue in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real but the writers green rush did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue please let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment some of us aren't fooled by corny plots bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue seeing her get away with it made me furious,0
203,informs us that 14 year olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious to those who don't know that the film performs a public service otherwise it's a lot of flashy with little or no reason for being i will allow that the camera work is sometimes striking but also that it can be madly self indulgent at other times the actors occupy screen space and screen time but do not compute as compelling human beings i suppose the e mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker but i simply couldn't tell enough differences to do so and really didn't care anyway,0
204,this pointless film was a complete disappointment none of the characters is likeable in the least so you watch what befalls each without really caring what was worst was renting this movie at a gay owned establishment only to find that this story of male hustlers was filled with homophobic young men engaged in plenty of scenes of straight sex and not one single scene of gay sex,0
205,a very interesting documentary certainly a lot more than sideways a pseudo wino drama where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed according to the documentary and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on parker only two men dictate the nature of in the world robert parker of and michel a french wine industry expert based in bordeaux and also known as a flying the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of france from sicily to argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made,1
206,i didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much heart's blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time br br everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality camera work editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing the titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed br br this movie just blew me away br br the showdown could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though br br it's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir films story acting scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film making,1
207,this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think viva la nudity,1
208,mr kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts what was he thinking this is a movie that should not have passed the hey i've got an idea let's make a sequel stage of inception if there was a zero rating i'd give it but i guess i'll settle for a generous 1 it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up hey i said hit and run kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me it is filled with unpleasant humor strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion if you are being dragged to this movie and someone is paying for you fine but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead however if you're planning on paying your own hard earned money search out a better alternative,0
209,ahh i didn't order no amazing hit show we'll you got one hack is simply the greatest television show ever made a little bit of me died when i flicked on the t v one friday night to catch a little hack and it wasn't on the show dug deep into key social issues of our culture i found that at the end of any episode i watched i walked away having been both entertained and informed i am actually dumber now that hack is gone i no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate since hack has been gone i see them as and an unneeded strain on so for the love of god we need to bring back hack,1
210,so the wwe has done it they have poured over into film their first one being see no evil starring their very own kane i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film it just seemed to cliché and looked like nothing new to my surprise it actually wasn't half bad a viewer stated above that it is good b horror movie fun and honestly thats the best way to describe it now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up well let's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the character he sold the role really well and really did look menacing but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around in solid muscle the acting was decent and the story was nothing new of course but we all know that the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done considering this was directed by a porn movie director i was quite surprised i'd recommend this movie if you're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film and save room for the ending too cuz it's a good one and stick around after the credits too,1
211,this sequel proves that tim burton was for all intents and purposes the best choice to ever direct a batman movie the story focuses on taking on three enemies the penguin wonderfully played by danny devito catwoman the slinky michelle pfeiffer and max the superb christopher walken br br perhaps the best entry in the series it has it all complex themes complex characters and a dark tone that truly stands out the cast is simply wonderful although the obvious stand out is devito as the multi layered penguin here is a guy who is evil pitiable funny and perhaps most importantly scary the infamous scene with image consultants still sends shivers up my spine in other words the cast is simply a joy to watch and all turn in first rate performances br br i do not hesitate to say that batman returns is my favorite of all the batmans released sorry dark knight fans if you want a superhero film that has a little more to offer besides flashy effects and big scale action then please check out this badly underrated film br br if nothing else it's at least the best film tim burton has ever made,1
212,spoilers ahead this same exact plot from this movie has been done before it has been done in ferris bueller's day off bat man houston plays sick his gullible parents believe him his sister knows that he's faking but she still must go to school she is mad he has a party with his friends while his parents are away by the time his parents get home he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party i like immature better when they were in house party 3 and still immature,0
213,i don't understand why it is so underrated on imdb this movie is just the perfection the better adaptation of all times of the myth of tarzan as a french i can say that this is the better role of christophe lambert ridiculous in a lots of movies but here absolutely wonderful charismatic incredible the plot is great well told the story magnificent the direction the atmosphere the music every things are perfect how believe these sequences with the music just simply perfect br br greystoke is truly an unbelievable movie underrated here i don't really know why but really appreciated,1
214,picture the scene a bored student with an empty day ahead a video shop with a special offer of 5 video for a week rentals this ex student usually just grabbed a pile of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary of reasons the turning anybody occasionally the odd undiscovered gem did make it into his vcr this being the case with this film everything about the film is good but much more than this the parts all mesh to provide something all too rare a cracking good film why this never got a uk cinema release is beyond me especially when we consider the crap that we have to wade through at the multiplex week on week whilst i'll happily accept this isn't oscar material but neither was sodding titanic schmaltzy cgi tinged bollocks it is a an extremely enjoyable film i was trying to think of a way to describe how best this film should be appreciated accepted the perfect film to watch while bonding with your dad after a coming home for the holidays after a large sunday lunch,1
215,what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film the script is full of holes from beginning to end incoherent not cohesive utterly ridiculous one of the most talented beautiful actresses in the world and i'm talking about nastassja kinski is without a single memorable line here worse she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter coyote lives in fairuza balk is photographed poorly to boot she looks like an overweight freshman who's out at too many all you can eat student cafeteria i was so looking forward to this film i wanted to like it but i think i'd rather watch nastassja read the phone book with her own hair,0
216,i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 i remember i was already familiar with elijah wood's work that's right he made stuff before lord of the rings and the merchandising tie ins to the film were pretty abundant flipper water guns were even circulating br br adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy br br unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely you know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away and the kid instead of getting out of the water into a boat floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there perhaps even below him br br another problem is paul hogan he looks old crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick by now no one even remembered crocodile dundee much less hogan and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish out of water social satire laughs br br all in all this is a really poor family movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in '96 and i hate it more now,0
217,yeah great cult tv series great atmosphere top script and good performances make this a class a candidate for dvd release br br this is a seminal tour de force of australian tv history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with doug gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70's all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its glory this is a memento from another and not too distant era and has the proud stamp of the land mighty down under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur br br come on abc get with the program and release this cool 70's cult baby for all to enjoy or re enjoy if you're lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time,1
218,milo is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it a long time ago he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people friday the 13th what's that one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo's dull i mean dark secret she and her friends have been dying to know once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage isn't it his bedtime yet and the girl well she screams a lot the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity,0
219,i´m only joking this was potentially the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through how anybody in the could have raised a laugh at this innane rubbish is beyond my comprehension i jest not,0
220,contains spoiler information watch this director's other film earth at some point it's a better film but this one isn't bad just different br br a rare feminist point of view from an indian filmmaker tradition rituals duty secrets and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience all of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses one husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love honor time and respect to his religious swami guru his wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister in law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband this unfaithful husband is openly in love with his chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a unbeknownest to him lesbian they only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity br br a servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke however she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members she lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows what's going on in the house and how much she disapproves br br in the end the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together but not before there is an emotional scene between the swami addicted husband and his formerly straight wife her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die however we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie br br the writer director of this film challenges her culture's traditions but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender we come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes each on surprises us with their humanity vulgarity tenderness anger and spirit,1
221,the elegant universe brings to light many ideas of the universe and existence after watching this documentary one can't help but take a step back and rethink their view on the existence of everything there is a large cast of scientists mathematicians and others on both sides of string theory it is continually brought into question as untested and possibly dead wrong the closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that quantum physics the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to sub atomic particles has never made an incorrect prediction not so with string theory no one is willing to say on camera that string theory is the truth and in so doing the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject,1
222,this is apparently the first film featuring gloria swanson the film that made her a breakout star while she was good in the film i can't see how this performance in particular was so noteworthy at the time but still it was a very good film br br gloria plays the wife of a rich slob that continually takes her for granted he cares little for his grooming eats onions and forgets their anniversary and at the same time a lothario comes into their lives and begins paying a lot of attention to gloria and her dippy husband doesn't even notice or give her any reason not to cheat on him ultimately she divorces her hubby and marries the smooth talking romeo however while the movie could have just been an overdone melodrama they were pretty common at the time it takes some interesting twists and turns and is an imaginative and fun film while not the greatest silent film i have seen it is a standout and deserves to be remembered br br by the way the dvd release from image entertainment is surprisingly good with a decent print and music this hasn't always been true of other image releases particularly how sloppily they handled the chaplin releases,1
223,having grown up a mormon and grappled with the church's bigotry towards blacks they were not allowed to hold the church's priesthood when i was a member i wasn't aware of the organizations policy of gay men and women until after i left the church in 1966 i was 20 i was stunned when i learned that friends who were gay were excommunicated even after serving on missions latter days exposes the mormon's persecution of gay members the film is long overdue it does an excellent job of showing how the two lead males come to terms with one another while managing to grow up and develop more fully as individuals latter days has great heart wonderful original music and an added touch of class from jacqueline bisset the film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves behind the confines of organized religion and reclaims his very soul,1
224,i'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do i'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is i'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie because i'll be here for ages if i do the storyline is typical and the special effects are below today's standards this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff as most of us here are little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience if your a casual movie watcher who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick then this movie is perfect for you lots of fun it would also be a good movie to take a partner to just not for us movie buff's br br 5 out of 10,0
225,the bothersome man is one of the best foreign films i have ever seen all the technical aspects are in my opinion perfect lighting acting directing pacing etc the story is breathtaking br br seemingly beyond death our main character finds himself inhabiting a world without beauty passion or anything remotely pleasing to the human senses his work is cold and uninteresting his relationships are numb and uninspiring and when it all becomes too much he seeks to end it in front of a train but it doesn't end he can not leave this strange world by suicide working his way back to a man who seemed to be feeling he same isolation and loneliness our main character joins him in excavating a stone wall in hopes of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful smell and music just as they break through and i will not reveal that much it all comes to an end and the movie ends as oddly as it began br br suffice it to say you will either love this movie or hate it i feel that it is like a magical poem open to many different interpretations and all of them as valid as the next if you enjoy new experiences in film and want to be taken away from hollywood's crap feast try this movie br br 9 10 and i don't rate easily because in spite of its darkness this movie left me with a sense of something greater something mysterious and beyond ourselves well done,1
226,i first saw this movie back in 1994 or '95 during my freshman year in high school when it was on lifetime after i first saw it i thought it was wonderful sure it may not have run longer but it is as accurate as can be in my own opinion regardless of what anyone else may think cynthia was great at portraying karen and mitchell anderson was okay as richard louise fletcher yes who played nurse in 1975's one flew over the cuckoo's nest was fine as well but i found her version of agnes karen and richard's mother to be a little bit of a control freak i am an extremely huge fan of the carpenters and i believe that karen's voice was and still is so wonderful it really saddens me about the fact that she is gone and had left this earth too soon but thanks to the never ending popularity of her music and her angelic voice the music will live on anyway back on track to this movie it really is a mystery to me and possibly other people fans and non fans of the carpenters as to what caused karen to end up getting this problem with her health was it the media that was responsible or was it just karen's decision i would not believe that it was her decision it could have been the media from one article that was printed out about her somewhere in '70 when their hit close to you came out from what was shown in the film there are some other moments in the movie as well richard's struggle with drugs and karen's brief marriage i did not hear about her loss in february of 1983 as i was not yet into watching the news i had found out years later i don't know if there will be another movie about the carpenters or karen made in the future but until then this movie will do fine i will say this though if karen had disregarded the false details of that article or any future articles that might have been published with similar content calling her chubby which must have been quite an insult she would still be here on this earth today i know that she is in heaven and probably entertaining everyone with her beautiful voice god bless you karen,1

228,strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing the clear attempt at dry black dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke br br with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season i personally like scrubs the office 30 rock trailer park boys pulling peep show simpsons family guy and i know what your thinking these shows aren't weird at all so some other good shows i've seen are jam garth marenghi's darkplace the book group asylum and snuff box which are original with dry black dark humour satire and are all at least 5 10 br br garth marenghi's darkplace especially is cheap looking overacted and weird however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too,0
229,it's all about getting what you want when you want it and the message of eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for until what you wish for wishes for you br br most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue misogynistic pirates aside cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert through a twisted in soul and in practice business deal he ends up marring buying her with the intent of bedding her but she will have none of it literally and frustrates him at every turn and corner and room and tourist attraction br br the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to and may not enjoy seeing in either cooper or colbert the whole reason i watched the film was because they are likable actors and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves they think from the world br br if you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film and satisfaction as we said is what it's all about such a movie with such a cast only comes around after all once in a ummm blue moon,1
230,ashes of time was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner the plot of ashes of time is fairly simple and comes down to two words love triangle because of those love triangles crossing stories jealousy hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters the narrative part is seen through yang eyes leslie cheung yang feng lives in the desert where he acts as to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved unfortunately ashes of time fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate wong kar wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors men and women everything else is a failure in this movie dialogs are and not original at all picture's quality is very much the editing is one of the worst ever seen at least by me in the swordplay genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved the so call erotic women on a horse scene is ridiculous not erotic and useless wong kar wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective,0
231,hey all i just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie i was actually one of the make up fx artists that help create the beast for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing i remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor br br what actually happened though was that jason palmer did the original make up for the sasquatch but for some reason they had to go back and re shoot much of the creature the sad part was that jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one br br for me it was quite sad because this was jasons final movie and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re shoots anyway i thought you guys may find that a tad and if you would like you can head over to com and check out some behind the scenes photos br br later jeff,0
232,this is a better than average entry in the saint series it holds your interest and as mysteries should keeps you guessing until the end and has several suspects to choose from br br many films from the golden age are not for all tastes especially younger viewers they date themselves by clothing cars settings etc who nowadays asks for a or wears a suit and tie everywhere and the legal process was so much simpler must have been a dearth of lawyers back then frankly much of value is missing from those days br br in any case go with it and enjoy it's good in an old fashioned sense,1
233,one of the most entertaining of all silent comedies is short a mad tale of how a rigorously intellectual board game could disrupt even the most carefully planned central economies such an unpromising comedic subject as chess found an earlier outlet in this delightful short two young men play the game earnestly against an artificial background a painted set this is in contrast to earlier lumiere shorts such as or du wherein the human activity was deliberately framed by a natural setting the difference in activities natural feeding baby watering garden artificial chess is possibly significant br br the main contrast in this film is between this background and the placid serene game of chess and the fierce passions this latter causes as accusations of cheating lead to a most melee the intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap just as the pretensions of arty filmmakers are forever deflated by the demands of audiences br br what is most amusing about the film is not neccessarily this descent into slapstick but the way it is filmed its prolonging long after the initial joke has been made the way the camera refuses to dignify the fight with anything like attention focusing instead on the set while we catch glimpses of hurling feet and dislodged clothing the film's refusal to edit is audacious so that the humour seems to arise from something else other than the fight reflecting our need for physical contact over intellectual stimulation our to let go br br what is especially brilliant is the denouement as these upper class fops are caught by the valet who picks them up like two errant schoolboys as if he is about to box their ears if masters can't be expected to keep their place with decorum than somebody's going to have to do it for them,1
234,hello everyone all i have to say is that human traffic and all of its characters are so real its funny i live in australia melbourne and i'm finally out of the clubbing and staying out all weekend lifestyle this movie explains everything that is currently going on in the world so exactly that i cant stop watching it i used to be exactly like so my friends said and i hadn't even seen the movie i left the weekend partying behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense partying to change my life around i was at a dvd store when i saw human traffic and i remember my old friends going on an on about it so i bought it to see what all the fuss was about i was so into it i watched it 4 times in a row because i couldn't believe that someone had made a movie that explains everything to a t anyways this movie is by far the best and funniest movie i have ever seen its funny because its so truthful in everything that goes on in the movie and is a legend thats all i have to say enjoy 11 10 blew my socks off at how real it was its exactly whats going on in the world hr rm i jabber a lot br br take care everyone,1
235,i thought i was going to see a ufo movie instead i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience me make the decision to accept christ in my life or risk going to hell the whole ufo thing was one big red herring the acting in it was pretty pathetic in fact it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members it wasn't real life dialog at all i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it if on the other hand you are into the whole church scene in a big way and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views no matter how limiting onto other people then by all means go see it,0
236,confirmed dead is an important episode in the series as it introduces four new characters the rescue team that naomi contacted before getting a knife in her back by locke however as the quote in my one line summary says their true purpose for being on the island may be something else entirely all the new characters appear intriguing especially miles some sort of psychic exorcist but at this point it's still too early to make solid judgments i felt that this episode was a slight step down from the beginning of the end no flash forwards this time short term flashbacks instead but it still has its stunning moments and picks up steam near the end out of 4,1
237,ed wood perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad they delight being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent br br james lay and his financial backers mom and dad it seems from the credits have created in a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film but lacking any charm or innocence dreamland simply stinks and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again br br i must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture i'm sure the production controller once seeing the completed film demanded to have his or her name changed in the credits to and the accounting done by one can imagine with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day br br i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little videotape but i must mention a few commentaries that compare this slag to the work of david lynch you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom log into imdb and post such astonishing bs no one save violent mental patients could ever mistake with anything produced by lynch what a horrific slight against mr lynch and his work br br go back to film school mr lay,0
238,the show is at least partially faked so is not reality just pretending to be reality which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode br br proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed there is already camera crew on the boat before he gets there can been seen as his boat approaches br br the actors playing ambulance officers didn't remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it which would never happen in reality br br they also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the emergency entrance which does not make any sense unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there,0
239,this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever frank welker welker makes the film knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty knotts works for a small no where town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials when things go wrong the city fathers allow knotts to take the fall frank character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott's good name this film shows the usual knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film this may have been knotts' last good outing when you have an extra 90 minutes get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon don knotts,1
240,i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start however it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end i felt somewhat cheated in a nutshell noble willingham of walker texas ranger fame plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son according to the mysterious caller willingham has a dark dirty little secret that affects the son and he the son is enjoying reminding him of it i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal one the movie has more foul language than goodfellas scarface casino and glengarry glen ross combined 99 of it is spewed from willingham himself it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four letter words two i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the telephone that many times especially when one knows that a crank caller is on the other end of the line no matter where willingham is in the movie whether it be at work home a diner etc the phone rings and he always answers it spewing venom at the son and then hanging up only to answer it again when the caller calls back in about ten seconds how many of us would do that now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter three and this is the most minor of the criticisms why is the director so opposed to showing us the man a k a the caller son most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place but since they didn't it's just one more to tack on i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it do see it if only one time however if you're like me you'll be saying triple k marine in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it,0
241,this movie was made 20 years before my time its introduction of john garfield in the supporting role of mickey borden makes it a classic he slumps onto the screen and your eyes are glued garfield was an original and his portrayal of whipping boy is a must see,1
242,the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal dramatic character well he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign the characters are not much better than a story despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him it doesn't work the same thing with other characters they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character although he wasn't the main character as the only bright spot towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions and i'm sure he had in the film they are hidden and practically under such a weird script br br grade 3 out of 10 those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed,0
243,we have a character named just wants to be a good person she's nice friendly smiles often but is strangely brutally honest also has a secret her idiot savant sister has been reciting original poetry which is getting the community excited about the sister writing unfortunately it's poetry while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in just tries to figure out what she really wants to do br br what to keep in mind while watching this movie is who really is for such a brutally honest person who doesn't mind telling ivy league types that she doesn't respect them it would seem odd that she would be able to pull off a lie for someone so happy and cheerful she's quite emotionless when it comes to certain issues those aren't character flaws they're plot development and they mean a lot more than they at first seem br br mostly this is something of a melodrama a character lies the other characters' personalities propel them through drama as relationships are held at risk but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch br br the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good they're acceptable and world is wreathed in color and light which makes for some very beautiful images but it's not very consistent it's not really so much of a flaw as a result of a low production value but within that same value is some genuine storytelling and a real care for the characters so while it isn't a perfect movie it's certainly an enjoyable one br br polarisdib,1
244,this movie is highly improbable read the other reviews to see why br br i would say that most of the characters were plastic but they didn't even afford themselves that little luxury they just act like cardboard cutouts of course they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles so that's a crap shoot whether they can act at least didn't give a crap and just went with it but lance fuhgeddaboutit br br the one character who rang true was portrayed by gerry lopez who didn't really act he was himself pretty much he's quite accustomed to stomping people the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster no way i would go out of my way to watch it,0
245,to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement br br the acting was unconvincing to say the least especially from actor craig fong who couldn't have acted stiffer as far as story goes well what story the film is nominally about harry lee a malaysian of chinese descent who comes back to his home country after flunking out of every course he took and tries to start a band br br the film has ever cliche you can think of sex tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in br br the problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened reviewers' hairs stand on end br br,0
246,just watched this and it was amazing was in serious doubt about renting the dvd or not so if you are and like watching other than brainless action movies don't hesitate any longer don't let the dull cover put you off the script is one of the best ever funny original touching and keeps you at the edge of the seat through the whole movie i had already watched another movie right before this one and was really sleepy and usually i get bored on watching a second movie in one night but this one really made me wake up and didn't have any boring moments it also made me rethink a lot of things in life and gave me a really good feeling br br also the acting is great one of kevin spacey's best roles the visuals are beautiful and the use of music is very well chosen if i have to come up with something negative to say about it well i can't really find anything enjoy 10 out of 10,1
247,this was an awesome movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic i have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention throughout every time i myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch any movie where i can get a glimpse of an f 16 flying if you like top gun then i guarantee you will love this movie also except for a few mild curse words this is an excellent movie for the whole family it has a great plot and does not have a dull moment throughout the entire movie every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next so once again i highly recommend this movie,1
248,ok this doesn't compare to the explosive tempo of the first part's opening sequence nor to its visual shock value nor for that matter to the melancholic suspense of the second installment no it's surprisingly and refreshingly different apart of course from the two main actors the tongue in cheek futuristic scenario drives the characters towards each other across genres and languages with an almost gravitational force the moment of impact conclusion is your choice of a shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume b sublimation of violence into homo c humorous detonation of an impossible buildup everything up to then is even less unequivocal br br highly recommended to indiscriminate movie buffs who don't mind following gras with a hot dog caution to those with more refined palates,1
249,this was one of the most mixed up films i have ever seen everything in the movie seemed to be attached to justify some other element that had been glued on there is even a talking buffalo that wants his wet nose rubbed to make the magic happen even the brutal father seems to be stuck in just to give the kids an excuse to fly away in a wagon it was laughable but in an uncomfortable way because of the serious subjects that seemed to be used just to set up the plot,0
250,there are no spoilers for this film as nothing could be written that could make it any worse the dictionary definition of puerile should now read sex lives of the potato men unless that is you like dog poo and in which case this is the film to see johnny vegas et all what were you thinking,0
251,as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation i wish the director and or the screen writer had done his her research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a rift that should not be there this movie portrayed the sikhs and muslims in a very negative manor while making the third group hindus look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations the inaccuracies coupled with the sear disregard for one's faith as portrayed by was a disgrace to the highest format though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles both kristen k and neve c played their rolls exceptionally i hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event,0
252,this movie was one of the rolling on the floor laughing movies i have ever seen danny de vito plays owen perfectly momma is excellently portrayed and was one of the highlights of the movie br br at the beginning of the movie it starts of differently then what you would expect larry is trying to write a book and is having some troubles larry teaches a writing class and owen tagged after larry trying to get him to read his story owen eventually asks larry to kill his mother and in return owen would kill larry's ex wife the whole movie was really hilarious br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is at the end when owen writes throw momma from the train larry gets furious because he just wrote a book of similar plot it turns out that owen wrote a children's pop up book br br i would really recommend this movie i gave it a 10,1
253,granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema br br the script was diabolical so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with the acting was almost as bad they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles they would have done a better job the murders were laughable the suspense was non existent the camera work was ineffective and the major plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate it just gets worse and worse br br the granny is possibly one of the most unthreatening villains caught on film she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket the hair caused endless amounts of laughter and a frilly nightgown would you be scared by that i certainly wasn't br br if you like watching bad movies see manos troll 2 michael bay films then this is a must see those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue avoid like the plague,0
254,ruggero deodato is often credited for inventing the cannibal subgenre with jungle holocaust in 1975 but director umberto usually acknowledged as a deodato rip off directed the man from deep river 3 years earlier in 1972 is it a worthy start for the genre well not really br br a photographer accidentally kills a man in self defense and while retreating into the jungles of an asian country is captured by a native tribe who hold him captive force him into slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the chief's daughter throughout the whole film i never felt this was a horror film it was more reminiscent of a drama like a man called horse which i liked better ivan rassimov is pretty good as the photographer but it is me me lai as the chief's daughter who is memorable and great i have always been a me me lai fan ever since her breathtaking performance in jungle holocaust and she is never given credit for her acting chops because she hardly speaks in her films she is still very talented and charming lots of real animal mutilation is the one thing about deep river that could make it a horror film but even that doesn't execute well br br the man from deep river is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre but as an entry in the genre is easily eclipsed by deodato's entries and even lenzi's own later entries recommended only for completists and me me lai fans,0
255,teenager tamara jenna dewan has it rough she's ridiculed by all the popular kids for being shy bookish frumpy and because of her interest in witchcraft all of the football players and cheerleaders are especially angry at her for writing an article on steroid abuse for the school paper on top of this her dad's a drunk her mom's not around and she's secretly in love with her supportive english teacher matthew marsden the popular kids set up a cruel prank to humiliate her accidentally kill her during a struggle bury the body in the woods and make a pact to keep silent to their shock the very next day tamara walks back into the classroom looking seductive and uh dressed to kill yep back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved she also takes time out to make her sexually abusive pop eat a beer bottle and tries to seduce her english teacher away from his wife claudette mink a guidance counselor at the school br br acting and writing are strictly mediocre you can also tell the people responsible for this have seen such movies as carrie 1976 hello mary lou prom night ii 1987 and the craft 1996 because it borrows wholesale from all three of those superior films there's some gore a guy cutting off his ear and tongue and then stabbing his eyeball probably being the best bit a nasty vomiting scene and a few campy witty one liners not an awful film by any means but not much originality went into it either,0
256,the premise of the film was very promising sort of a gay napoleon dynamite type of film and to be fair there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall the script and dialog felt like a local sketch production full of clichés and scenes that were predictable br br however there was enough that was amusing that i stuck around to see how it finished since there were hints that something special happens at the end but it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits br br overall it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable,0
257,the price of a dream and some dreams can be too expensive br br only having viewed the english translated version it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer br br it made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at br br and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better br br but some plot elements remained unexplained leaving an unfinished feel br br it also leaves the thought is there a series to follow br br a pity there was no more at this stage at least anyway,0
258,i found the film don't look in the basement to be very good with some great characters in it it is about a young psychiatric nurse called nurse charlotte beale rosie who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum whilst there she meets various sorts of different characters including dr geraldine masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital dr stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe br br my favourite characters in the film are mrs reah macadams a very funny little old lady allison who is a nymphomaniac and sam bill a young black guy who goes around all day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time the film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film i know that it was on the 'video nasties' list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it it did have some disturbing senses in it great film recommended,1
259,yet another foreign war movie that puts hollywood to shame real in the same proportions that hollywood productions such as harts war and are unreal a moving story backed up by strong acting and great film making,1
260,so one day i was in the video store looking for a movie i came across this and rented it because it was a film i hadn't seen or even heard of br br now i like slasher movies in general but this is just abysmal not even good for laughs besides being ultra ultra cheap and containing all slasher film cliches and terrible acting it has the most incompetent and inept direction i have ever come across now sometimes the aforementioned traits can be present in a film and some enjoyment can still be had but not here painful example of home made horror,0
261,now don't get me wrong i love a good film and after watching the thin red line and loving it i was eager to track down terrence two earlier films and having just watched days of heaven my enthusiasm to see badlands has virtually disappeared br br i have noted much rave about the beautiful photography but i saw this film on a terribly old vhs tape which made it look pretty awful all i can say is i hope the photography was superb because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film not since the replacement killers have i fallen asleep during a film this film felt so long and it wasn't the editing was choppy and disjointed the storyline non existent the voice over was an incoherent ramble the characters weakly developed and the whole thing was uninvolving i know that malick was uncertain of how to do the film he consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together this is very apparent on screen everything looks chopped up every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum or some character development it would obtrusively cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things it was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people farming the few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest i would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly over rated something must be said br br maybe a farmer would like it,0
262,the last person who dies before new years is cursed to drive the phantom carriage for a whole year picking up the souls of the dead br br i saw a scene from this old silent swedish horror film on youtube and decided to track down the whole movie it was well worth the work finding it because it's an absolutely amazing movie for the time it was made it has a wonderfully eerie atmosphere the old time horror film makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere sadly many of today's film makers don't seem to understand how important setting and atmosphere are and go for the cheap jump scares the visual effects are excellent considering its date of production if you can find a copy of this i highly recommend giving it a watch 9 10,1
263,excuse me cuba gooding jr should have won an oscar for his portrayal in this film he was the film while the film may be lacking in some areas cuba was awesome and for me this is the best role that he has ever played the scene in the movie where he finds out that his mother has died made me break down and cry in the theater i guess i could really relate to this film because i saw the same treatment of people just like that at my own school growing up what a tragedy getting to see the real radio and coach at the end of the movie was really special too if you can watch this movie and not be moved to tears you need a heart check if you liked simon birch and the mighty you'll love radio too i wish they made more movies like this radio is the real deal,1
264,not as bad as 1992's nails where hopper plays an unstable cop but pretty bad how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong this film manages to find a way the story was pretty stupid and hopper's direction seemed like he had never directed before all of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue,0
265,a team of amateur journalists and tree huggers catches wind of a secret government project project on a remote south pacific island the scientists there are producing giant sized corn but the genes are spreading to other species creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra one that's bullet proof and swims underwater with the help of the scientist's daughter can they escape the island and tell the world even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci fi channel which sadly i did it would scream sci fi channel with its low production value weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history the effects here are comparable to another creature film raptor island although not nearly as bad i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again br br which is not to say it's not enjoyable i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him but i thought it was a pretty good use of time as bad the whole thing is it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the film i believe the actress' name is michelle michael pare also appears as a ship captain and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on furnace look respectable even if that movie is intolerably bad br br i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be bad effects low budget no name actors i didn't have any higher hopes yet this doesn't mean that it's awesome either coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department for the one fan who likes this film and calls it hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement,0
266,wales seems to be turning out some quirky movies recently actually wales seems to be developing its own little film industry i recently saw very annie mary which i thought was very good but plots with a view is not only quirky it's laugh out loud funny has a cast of wonderfully talented actors brenda blethyn is amazing and a plot that while not entirely original is so cleverly written that one is always gleefully picking up what might almost be throwaway lines it was the kind of movie that i wanted to watch again immediately it was over and one of very few that i would actually like to own even though many of the characters are caricatures and you have to have been to a welsh village to appreciate that they are also very human and the rapport between blethyn and molina is a joy to behold,1
267,the films' producers are hoping that cameron name will help sell this picture unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen despite some beautifully shot european locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its awkward unbelievable romance between brewster and eccleston an filmgoing experience,0
268,while studying the differences between religion and cult in college mindy rachel miner who is the best student in the class convinces her schoolmates cassandra taryn manning bailey glenn dunk alex joel and morgan victoria to research the massacre of worshipers of kwan yin by their leader owen robert twenty years ago in california had found an ancient amulet in southern china that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls but one woman resists and he is destroyed however after the death of morgan who apparently committed suicide the students discover that has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet br br the storyline of 'cult is not totally bad unfortunately the screenplay the direction the acting the lines the camera the cgi and the edition are awful i was completely bored and tempted to use the ff button of the dvd but i resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never ending crap on a saturday night my vote is two br br title brazil o the secret charm,0
269,i just saw everything is illuminated at the film festival this is a truly remarkable film very emotional funny at times and heart warming bring your handkerchiefs for those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes i'm reminded of the endings of babette's feast and the notebook the stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes just as this film did br br no spoilers here the summary is as imdb describes a young man's journey to the ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up br br the dialog is in english and ukrainian and russian too i believe this allows for some wonderfully linguistically based moments as one character interprets more or less faithfully for the english speaker in the group depending on the circumstances br br the scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful eastern european influences be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune br br this is directorial debut and is well done i give this film a 9 one of the best films i've seen in a long time i recommend it highly,1
270,for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and story driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own cliché and role the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesn't even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves or better dissolves itself with a by the book deus ex machina more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen it's history alright first the movie's a drama though it's supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audience br br this movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and so's the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late 1980's in fact the visual treats seem static un inspired and un original br br worst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you don't bother with characters and all that stuff there's too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one,0
271,i wonder how many mini cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie it couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car which is featured in this film along with an attractive cast br br this is a very very entertaining heist and chase film it features a cool cast with mark wahlberg charlize theron edward norton seth green and jason statham br br the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in venice italy the film doesn't overdo the violence has a pretty intelligent script with a few short exceptions features interesting characters and is nicely the cat and mouse game between norton and theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch br br once again however we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as the good guys how many times has this happened since the days of butch cassidy and the sundance kid in the 1960s it's twisted hollywood for you in here one of the criminals norton stole and killed the leader and father figure donald sutherland of the gang so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain also theron's character is in the typically overblown feminist mode of hollywood in which women can do all things including driving a car better than a man a third minor irritation is seth green's smug smart ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool br br despite these hindrances it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex and yes those little cars are cool everyone i've talked to who has seen this film enjoyed it,1
272,hannibal spoilers hannibal lecter anthony hopkins is back for a travesty of a movie now he's in italy appreciating our food including people such as rinaldo giancarlo giannini but comes back to the states for clarice julianne moore and to even the score with a former victim mason verger gary oldman br br let me tell you this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with silence of the lambs and manhunter because it's truly completely absolutely totally bad br br i mean the scene near the end with ray liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain wtf then why the hell was everybody so annoying including clarice and why did the story keep going nowhere i suppose that this is the chapter of the hannibal series terrible stupid gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing br br don't watch it especially if you love any other of the hannibal movies manhunter red dragon hannibal rising br br hannibal 1 10,0
273,if you feel like wasting 86 minutes on a film that makes no sense is badly written with a bad plot and bad acting then this little gem is for you recommended for those who are about to fall asleep major annoyance will be felt by the awake viewer do not pay to see this movie,0
274,it's a mystery to me as to why i haven't caught up to this masterful 50s caper film  turned brooding noir until now but i'm certainly glad to report that it didn't disappoint i haven't seen any of jules dassin's american films for several years but based on this i'll probably be going back and re watching brute force and night and the city quite soon br br jean a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world weariness and coldness has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films hey there wouldn't be a story otherwise isn't coping well with the straight life an opportunity presents itself an easy multi million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men the taut filming of the robbery half an hour of total silence is what people most remember about the film of course and indeed it's pretty remarkable but i liked the half completed location of the final shootout once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white and channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance br br perhaps it's a bit too sentimental in the end but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or thought provoking george at turns modernist romantic and jazzy score is another highlight,1
275,i started watching this expecting the worst i was happy to find that the film turned out to be enjoyable slightly confusing in parts like when they all started singing it gave me a chance to see daniel wu in action for the first time he is a better actor than i thought at times he seemed a bit out of place i thought purple storm deserves its hong kong legends release as it is different to most other hk films it is about a mans emotional struggles when confronted with memory loss it may sound corny but when he eventually pieces out what and who he actually is it really makes the film a lot more interesting once you get into the film you will find it keeps you gripped to it as if you miss one bit then a lot of the film wil make sense for example i missed a bit at the start and i recommend to anyone that watches this that they do not miss any of it so i can say that this film was worth watching and a grateful surprise for me that i enjoyed it,1
276,the three part series ended last night on pbs which i believe was its first wide exposure to an american audience the richness of its text and the unique quality of its filming are high points it seems very novel to view and hear an action play employing the vernacular of georgian england jane austen's filmed drawing rooms being the primary example of that form of speech yet it is the scope of drama overwhelming the senses that makes quaint language fit perfectly into each and every scene such bold exposure to an old reality is evocative of literary giants like tolstoy or shakespeare while at the same time entertaining in the manner of a c s or patrick o'brian sea saga the universality of basic human condition lies at its center br br narrator talbot as played by an actor with the almost perfectly appropriate name of benedict surely not even dickens could beat that one alternates between stodgy jingoism and extreme vulnerability an acting tour de force indeed i cannot recall among this very fine cast any misstep of interpretation that is a tribute not only to the actors themselves but to the director as well br br the most impressive element however is how perfectly life aboard a man of war en route to australia in the early 1800's is presented that is especially true of how the motion of the ship becomes almost a character itself something sea stories rarely take into account except as backdrop anyone who has ever experienced mal de mer in person will recognize it instantly and appreciate all the more how difficult it must have been to recreate within the context of filming br br this is no fanciful pirates of the caribbean some effort must be expended in attaining an understanding of its nuances,1
277,i truly hate musicals because music numbers just start out of the sudden and usually spoil scenes but this one is completely different it's simply brilliant plot perhaps isn't any challenge for the viewers but the simplicity of people life stories makes this movie great br br i've seen it at least dozen times and still i'm not tired with the plot characters or music i just love the soundtrack it's the only soundtrack that i've really wanted to have and most probably will remain the only one that i owe br br for me it's a must seen kind of movie great characters compiled with entertaining songs and a lot of things to think about after the movie end,1
278,the story in this movie is fairly implausible b grade stuff but the script called for a creepy guy to play the lead and in 1940 that meant peter lorre and peter is at his creepiest in this one as island owner stephen who gets prisoners paroled to his custody to work at his island diamond mine upon arrival the discover that they are slave mine workers that can be beaten or killed at the whim of br br only two things seem to have it worse off than the slaves wife and monkeys monkeys tick him off so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only meat the slaves get br br lorre is perfect in his role here and creeps up the screen in industrial strength fashion although the script is not casablanca caliber the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes this is a very watchable story but i'm not sure what niche this movie filled too long for a short subject and too short for a feature length film i'm not sure how this was marketed to theaters br br i just caught this for the first time on a late night early morning tcm showing lorre fans will not want to miss this one if they haven't seen it,1
279,y'know it's very interesting watching this half the people involved with it are now dead br br anyways it's been a long time since i've watched anything muppet related but this stuff is pure gold i'm a great fan of puns and this movie has them quite well placed but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing it's not really high speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go br br kermit the frog is just an awesome character his voice and the expressions on his puppet face are fantastic but above all he points out why he's popular he can sing and make jokes too but more appropriately why he's so endearing he without any effort inspires everyone to search for their dreams in the meantime he also has to deal with himself which is an uncommon theme in family movies br br it also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there some to great effect others to a little less i think mel brook's part was just a bit overplayed do you some parts of the film are just kind of odd but it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction br br moving right along br br polarisdib,1
280,everyone likes the coolly created memorable heist movie alain delon provides the antihero melville provides the cool and a handful of other great talent yves montand gian maria and andre mostly arrives to add a crisp engaging movie br br with very little dialog this is great because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick witted and their various repartees this movie however could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed not to say the sound is bad oh no the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow patient deliberation of the patients very compelling br br what's also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic usually when it comes to cinematography black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe br br polarisdib,1
281,my mom always told me to sit down and to actually watch this movie because it's one of her favorites i never did for years until i caught one night on tv this movie was great i don't even know how to explain it not only is the cast excellent julia roberts keifer sutherland kevin bacon william baldwin and oliver platt but the story is awesome it's freaky but not too scary and it makes you think i was left speechless after this film and amazed of how good of actors and actress all five of these people really are where did william baldwin go he's great this film is a must see for anyone if you haven't seen it go rent it you will not be sorry amazing,1
282,you cannot be seeing the same movie if you didn't grow up in france or spent at least 10 years there like me i don't know if it will ever make it outside french cultural borders i include belgium and luxembourg here you cannot translate its kind of fun every name is joke how many people outside paris would understand the pun in the name of one of the roman legionnaires however monica bel l is so beautiful i almost forgot to breathe when i saw her,1
283,a total and utter travesty of a movie 'dark the kind of film even troma would be embarrassed to release the script direction acting and action sequence's are so dire as to be almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking that it's mere 75 minute running time could have been better spent the above reviewer must be related to the director as that's the only reason i can see for his her appraisal of this rubbish some might call it b movie fun or 'so bad it's good' just to excuse there enjoyment of it but when the lead actor and most experienced cast member cant deliver his lines convincingly you know you've got a very very bad movie avoid at all costs,0
284,this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons soulless technically good and the usual in jokes for adults maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa castle in the sky but it was quite disappointing br br the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and going to the territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship yadda yadda br br the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes the vikings get all the best ones such as the chief's wife giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy literally oh and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious as much for the voice acting as the dialogue br br for example aboard the viking ship after a speech by abba the captain's daughter olaf who is this new guy captain that's my daughter cod brain olaf your daughter's a man,0
285,this was such a beautiful film such an amazing performance from joseph and brad very innocently written and performed a must see i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie this is a movie that every family should sit down with their children to watch it does teach us all a very important lesson in life and how we should be approaching the harsh subject of aids how we should be teaching our children to cope with it and people around them not only with aids but with any terminal illness i hadn't even heard of this movie until i through t v one day and happen to run across it i recommend everyone to watch this just don't forget your box of tissues more movies should be made like this one extremely heartwarming,1
286,as bad as this movie is i really like it the poor acting dialogue and action made it so funny i loved john travis from omega cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak probably had to shake nod at the security questions actually why can't they speak it fails to adhere to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers no machines as such and those weird face mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that aeroplane landing lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the plot and no explanation is given about anything do not expect to understand this film instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the barman's decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for entertainment all the good guys seem to enjoy this why did old guy get to beat up our hero and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water jets out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth definite top 20 b movie must check for a part 2,0
287,anytime i'm not giving 150 to my dreams or my goals i think of mark the real life subject of american movie mark's dogged persistence at having his first feature film produced and shot is so captivating that it will have you laughing shaking your head with sadness and rooting for him br br i haven't seen a documentary this honest since the movie on r the supporting cast mark's real life family and friends are all great give this movie a chance and you'll see a great film and a wonderful portrait of the stuff that the american dream is made of,1
288,wow a masterpiece of a movie not to be missed br br i had no idea what this movie was when i started watching it late night i didn't find out it was a stone film until after the film when i went on imdb watching it i was mesmerized the cast especially eric bogosian is just superb one of the best scripts and camera work ever the movie drew me in and kept me entranced until the very end i did not dare blink for fear of missing something amazing how a small budget film can be so engrossing and well made while huge budget films that feature tons of action and computer generated special effects can be so incredibly boring don't miss this film,1
289,there is no way to put into words just how bad how shapeless and laughless these vice academy films really are you have to experience one for yourself for the third time in a row writer director rick sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent there is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at yet the very brief nudity and other plot elements make the films unsuitable for kids which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental capabilities of 5 year olds elizabeth makes a more than welcome replacement for linnea quigley she is winningly bubbly and cute and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well but watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure,0
290,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br unorthodox journalist mike sullivan vinnie jones away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel but everything changes when the landlady of the thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer charles dickens is found as he digs deeper into both mysteries he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for br br in 1998 former footballer vinnie jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic lock stock and two smoking barrels okay no one was blown away by his acting ability but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy but it all proved to be a one hit wonder and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like gone in sixty seconds and swordfish before descending into the realm of straight to dvd hell the latest being this muddled and thriller which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like derek jacobi julie cox vanessa redgrave jason flemyng and mel smith along with him what caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly apart from maybe being a one trick pony is anyone's guess a dodgy personal life being a possible guess but here he is br br a script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand but with a miscast looking jones in the lead it's even more of a task to fathom jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and dickens himself talking directly to the camera through out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director also writer brendan foley has made a bad first impression br br what exactly did i expect with something that came free with the daily mail,0
291,okay this may not be the most sophisticated movie you'll ever see actually there isn't a bit of in it it's puerile adolescent inoffensive idiotic and utterly hilarious basically richie and eddie run the worst hotel in britain cue some ridiculous antics with the guests while they beat each other up try to get the rent money out of the only resident who is daft enough to stay have an all night drinking binge with the boys from the power plant next door and fall in lust with the beautiful actress who comes to stay to avoid the press give it a try if you're a fan of and and their work if you're not don't get the movie simple as that br br i'm not being thick this is a word from another one of fab into the movie world,1
292,i completely disagree with the other comments i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable robin williams is in top form true the tone is familiar but it is williams of good morning vietnam smart funny on point after too many dark turns williams is finally back to what he does best the supporting actors give great performances especially laura linney and chris walken chris plays himself as usual but as the agent to the next president he was a delight each time on screen lewis black plays only himself basically but he is wonderfully well used here there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum the movie is more than what the trailer suggests as well the movie is funny but it is not a pure comedy as suggested it has a bit of a thriller line which everyone should seriously consider especially if you pay attention to the newspaper,1
293,i am a massive hitchcock fan ever since seeing rear window on television saboteur is not hitchcock's best for me though it is very good but not a masterpiece it does have its faults some parts are rather slow moving and as a consequence of it being written off in a hurry the script felt rather incomplete but hitchcock's direction is superb and the performances weren't that bad while robert cummings and priscilla lane both do a good enough job otto kruger and norman lloyd come very close to stealing the show the story is good about a wronged man on the run very similar themes used in 39 steps and north by northwest and cleverly provides some much needed escapism the music score was absolutely outstanding the music in the opening title sequence was phenomenal almost like a distorted march and i liked the digs at tchaikovsky's 1st piano concerto and beethoven's 5th symphony the cinematography is also crisp and smooth the scenery and landscapes almost dazzling and there are also a number of very effective scenes namely the statue of liberty climax but the circus troupe encounter and the radio music city hall shoot out is also on the money overall not hitchcock's best but definitely worth the look 8 10 bethany cox,1
294,it is the best movie released in bollywood upto date the best comedy the best acting and the best direction till now rajkumar santoshi's writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry aamir khan was absolutely amazing salman khan looked good the way he acted shakti kapoor was good but over acted as usual this comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again even rajkumar santoshi hasn't been able to make this cult classic again this movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people br br star br br acting 10 10 br br dialogues 10 10 br br screenplay 10 10 br br direction 10 10 br br music 9 10 br br lyrics 9 10 br br overall this movie is strongly recommended if you didn't watch it till now you missed something big it is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date classic films like hera pheri golmaal and bhi do are not even half as funny as this br br great movie hats off,1
295,i'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot this is strictly a b movie on its way to obscurity the shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film erika eleniak never anything you'd call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into anna nicole smith in her big period daniel bernhardt i almost shed a tear he's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the bloodsport series also b movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable here he is a shell of his former self sure he's older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested i just don't get it don't these people invest william forsythe is another heavy that i've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in i'm not going to even mention mr reynolds his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more the only winner is andrew divoff as usual a creepy evil villain with a sandpaper voice that can milk the best kind this is a movie you watch for laughs there's nothing else to it,0
296,i remember when this show came out it was originally advertised as a mini series at the end of the last episode it said to be continued to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing it ended as it was supposed to so yes you can blame the series for having no ending the plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher but it was a boring show that way too long and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would so they never made any more quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public when the truth is that for this show that is not the case it ended the way it was actually planned to end it is just a lousy ending,0
297,a lovely librarian played by playboy model kristine debell falls asleep and dreams herself into a strange world filled with extremely uninhibited these people love to sing and dance and fool around alice has a series of sensual adventures among these br br the film was originally shot as a poem to eroticism with few explicit sex scenes which were eventually cut from its theatrical videocassette versions however have had some of the original erotic encounters joined at the end with them br br for an extremely low budget picture the producers of this film did an extremely good the cinematography is full of life and energy the dances and numbers quite professional and the acting without a doubt it is one of the best adult fairy tales around,1
298,tumbling doll of flesh by is a japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions typically twisted japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore there is no plot to speak of just plenty of hard core sex scenes optically censored again and lots of blood the special effects are quite impressive the dismemberment of japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail the tongue cutting scene really made me squirm her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines psycho the snuff reels actually reminds me guinea pig flowers of flesh and blood but it's not as memorable so if you're a fan of ultra depraved japanese sickies like all women are whores or raping my virgin slave give this one a look 8 out of 10,1
299,this movie is a picture perfect action drama and thriller every scene has you sucked in i watched this movie and was amazed by how many talented actors were in the movie damian especially was great he played his role perfectly the story was made for these actors the characters make the movie so realistic this movie very simply gets an a plus from me definitely watch this film it compares with scarface but has a more in depth story this movie not only gives you a good picture of the gangster life but it also gives you the characters emotions and at the end you really feel for the main character watch this film,1
300,everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc so i finally rented it and i was amazed i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it i wouldn't call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the lambs and or kiss the girls it did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat 7 10 br br rated r for strong torture violence language and sexuality,1
301,the second not animated movie about the only people still refusing to surrender to the roman empire is even more hilarious than the first film asterix contre ceasar br br where the first movie got all the laughs because all cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their identity this sequel which is a separate story as are all the comic books is even better sure all the ingredients that you find in the first movie and in the comic books are present again is still dying to taste the magic potion that gives his other tribe members such enormous powers caesar and the rest of the roman empire are still enemy number 1 but some new refreshing elements have been brought to the stage as well br br not only is setting very idyllic biggest part plays of course in egypt but rather than repeating movie number one some extras have been added by making all kinds of references to other movies bruce lee etc this is all not very new but the unexpected combination of the known story from the comic book with almost the same title as the movie and references to stuff that has got absolutely nothing to do with asterix really works br br in that way the movie builds further on a tradition by comic writers and who didn't hesitate to bring laurel and hardy on the stage and even dedicate an entire story to kirk douglas br br if all of this doesn't convince you to watch this movie i'm sure monica bellucci playing cleopatra will,1
302,this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out and the frequent black and white to color switch i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever and it was another clichéd action movie with a hero a bad guy and a few hostages i could make a better movie than that with my own camera why i can hold it steady something the director couldn't do over all truly the worst i have ever seen you thought disney was bad i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome and the visual were the worst i have ever seen,0
303,it is a risky business to film such a lavish production of the merchant of venice it could be a stodgy wooden period piece or it could be laughable for its excesses this version is neither while i am not completely sold by al very restrained shylock he does give a competent and honorable performance jeremy antonio is as always with his tortured self roles riveting some of the lesser roles seemed to be a little to much in the spirit of boisterous fun a boy's own adventure story but the central plot is efficiently and sympathetically moved forward through the film br br it goes without saying that the location shots costumes and interiors were breathtaking almost to the point of distraction br br one thing on which i do not wish to comment on is the anti content of the play the film is as sympathetic to the predicament of the jews as possible while still portraying shylock as the instrument of his own self destruction it is a sad comment that four centuries later the director of this film found it necessary to comment on his nuanced view before the premiere screening at the toronto film fest br br this is a beautiful film and i look forward to several viewings,1
304,this is one of the best presentations of the 60's put on film arthur penn director of bonnie and clyde and little big man saw that steve outstanding script rang with truth and from these two talents comes solid cinema jodi georgia miles gives male viewers a hit of pained nostalgia for the archetypal beauty who is almost within our grasps but always just out of reach just see it or you cinematic education will be incomplete,1
305,1st watched 12 26 2008 dir eugene levy corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers but this one by charles shyer nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts the story is about a couple of down and out traveling americans played by richard lewis and sean young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return upon trying to return it they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story the other cast members include character actors john candy james belushi cybill shepherd george hamilton and others after the police find out about the death they start questioning the main characters and of course they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi shepherd couple this isn't a horrible movie it just isn't that good there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile try it maybe you'll like it probably you won't,0
306,this film is my favorite comedy of all time and i have seen a lot of comedies first of all i should not this film had no script just a storyboard the dialogue is almost completely written by the actors which makes this film absolutely the cast is one of the best comedic you will ever see the story is about the dog show in philadelphia and some of the contestants in them parker posey shines and is absolutely great this is one of those films that most of the laughing comes from the absolute pathetic ness of the characters,1
307,i enjoyed this film immensely due to pungent scenes humorous as well as ironic some even tragical believable performances witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what it´s like or rather c a n be like to be hetero and or homosexual on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires i´m aware of the paradox here homo a n d this is something the film tackles on end but never uses for caricature if you´re as open minded as the people seem to have been who made that film in the end it won´t matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or not br br mr smith from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses salesman with strange appetites here but that´s not the only thing to marvel at enjoy,1
308,i just don't get it why call this a sequel to the film american werewolf when it has absolutely no connection with it whatsoever the first film was funny and scary with ground breaking special effects if memory serves the oscar category for special make up effects was created for this movie paris is none of these things awful effects and not much else do not see this movie rent the original werewolf in london instead you'll be much happier,0
309,was garbo's 14th film and the first in which her husky swedish voice was heard she plays the lead character anna who has struggled with being abandoned by her father chris a drunken barge owner played by george f marion and with the misfortune of the life she has has to lead to keep her head above water br br meeting irish matt charles bickford may mark the turning point for her or does it garbo looks and sounds great in this drama which although looking rather clunky and moving at a slow pace still manages to interest and engage an audience nearly 80 years later marie dressler makes an impact in the role which gave her a second flush of movie success in films such as min and bill dinner at eight and emma while marion and bickford are more than adequate br br an interesting slice of movie history garbo would do better talkies in the years following but will always be remembered for the first time she talked on screen,1
310,the monster will look very familiar to you so will the rest of the film if you've seen a half dozen of these teenagers trapped in the woods movies okay so they're not teenagers this time but they may as well be three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly abandoned ghost town in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century and a half before you'd think that with a title like miner's massacre some interesting things might happen they don't in fact only about 1 10 of the film actually takes place in the mine i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge but instead i got terrestrial twenty somethings fornicating and in one case defecating in the woods a gang of morons with a collective i q that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine no suspense no scares and a couple of embarrassing performances somebody forgot to tell the writers that fool's gold refers to the genuineness of the gold not the people who are looking for it 3 10,0
311,though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance i don't think bergman's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres even the lightest are quite complex this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc i don't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary you almost wish it not to end i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties having come to know most of his later groundbreaking efforts before nykvist von sydow etc the master produced some of the richest warm and touching movies i have ever seen though it's a long shot i have seen this kind of love for human kind in its complexity only in fellini's movies of the same period a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans to have the full image of the man's capabilities and for those who love cinema with a heart may he rest in peace,1
312,i'm not a big tv person but when i saw the premier episode of greek i couldn't wait until next week i don't miss the show for nothing br br thank god for dvr lol i'm in love with he acts like a bad boy but he is so sweet everybody has their own character so we have pretty much all types of people you could still throw in a hispanic and a chubby persons br br i didn't go to school in usa so i never liked the idea of frat houses and stuff like that so when my husband told me about the show i didn't pay attention until he asked me to watch it and since i didn't have noting better to do i agreed i laughed so hard the first night that i just needed to keep watching it br br so i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on i will hope for a second third and who knows how many more episodes its a really good show very funny and entertaining,1
313,man the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking br br this 6th entry into the long running halloween series is certainly a bad one you just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build up movie br br it's simply a poorly done film that also suffers from its imagine less writing and non compelling characters that are in it dr loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it it's a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last film role it's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one br br there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie from pretty early on already he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality also the attempts to uncover myer's past don't really work out for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well it's obvious that the script went through various re writes before and also very possibly during filming several scenes even got re shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing br br the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one this is also due to the lack of some real good gore as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch br br so far the worst out of the series br br 3 10,0
314,this movie was poorly conceived poorly written and poorly acted all of the characters were two dimensional it was a real amateur attempt the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda the christian characters are holier than thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters the movie was a real gotcha for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer putting us in a very uncomfortable situation i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie i remember another movie on a similar subject the rapture starring mimi rogers that was much better and professionally done i think i'll watch the rapture again if you attend unidentified and don't like it don't say i haven't warned you,0
315,rush in rio is simply an amazing dvd this concert is one of the peak moments of the history of rush and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever br br i was lucky enough to actually be in this concert and not only that i was in the very first row grabbing the gate that separated the audience from the stage it's the first and only time i've seen a rush concert live and it was a dream come true for me i have no words to accurately describe this experience but i can tell you it is one of the highlights of my life br br some people complain about the sound of this dvd saying it is not very clear and polished but the sound you listen is real true to how it was in the concert it is raw and powerful and so authentic that every time i watch it i go back and re live that beautiful moment many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was sure you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound this way but you don't get the real thing this is not the case with rush in rio this is the real deal i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd's i love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest you listen to rush just the way they sound in a live performance no tricks no tweaks this is a real live concert dvd br br i highly recommend rush in rio the set list is fantastic and the performances by geddy alex and neil are mind blowing not to mention the crowd you can see how much they love rush and sing along to every tune even which is an instrumental i actually appear singing twice in tom sawyer i sing always hopeful yet discontent and in i sing only reflect it's just a few seconds but i simply couldn't believe my eyes when i saw myself in a rush dvd awesome i hope you enjoy this magnificent concert from the greatest band on earth,1

317,katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking and is thought by the local folk to be a witch kate works overly hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick named trigger hicks but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario constantly smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes first crush but alas he's married no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula based on a play and brought to the screen by r k o with too broad a hillbilly flourish it is ungodly and just about unwatchable 1 2 from,0

320,they actually make a big deal out of a scene in which steven hurdles a 3 foot fence the plot is barely there the acting so to speak is distressing and the action is catastrophically lame this is the worst seagal film ever and that is saying something,0
321,shadows breathes the smell of new york's streets like no film before it this kick off of cassavetes' directorial work is as atmospheric as political and the initial spark for a renewal in american cinema br br maybe it solicits for watching cassavetes' first work in a double feature with another debut godard's À bout de soufflé both films shaped the cinematic production of their countries beyond decades and both breathe a peculiar lightness and which was later rarely achieved by those filmmakers in their career br br shadows tells from three afro american siblings ben ben carruthers lelia lelia goldoni and hugh hugh hurd the story is set in the new york jazz milieu and the driving rhythms on the soundtrack play a main part for the feverish sometimes almost dreamlike atmosphere which draws through the entire film there's not much happening in the plot the everyday life of the three siblings is defined by problems in love relationship or in their jobs but on both levels normality deceives without moralizing cassavetes simply describes the mechanism of racial exclusion in public and in private life it was regarding to the cinematic depiction of racism a breakthrough film in the us br br this film owes also a lot to the performances of the three leading actors which were all almost completely unknown before especially ben carruthers established with his energetic portrayal the image of a new self conception of young urban blacks in america an image which characterizes spike lee's films of the 80s and 90s revealingly none of those three doubtlessly extremely talented actors was able to start a big career afterwards hollywood wasn't and isn't ready to ethnically expand its star system and that is why goldoni hurd and carruthers only found small artistic in tv and independent films later on br br perhaps shadows is one of the less beautiful films ever shot and one of the most beautiful ones at the same time a film of shades and spaces with a camera that merely watches the stream of life in the crowded street corners bars hotel lobbies apartments inducing an intriguing ramble through new york's vibrant streets,1
322,may contain spoilers br br the first time i saw this movie was when it was re released on video when i was around 8 years old now i am 17 and still watch it whenever i get a chance to the aristocats was a cute heart warming film that i immediately fell in love with i loved the songs on it especially the one the kittens sing by the piano in fact i even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend since i loved it that much all three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the prettiest cartoon cats i ever saw the ally cat had a great voice br br my favorite part of the movie is when the kittens are playing the piano that part is adorable i also enjoy their journey home it's incredible this is one of the best disney films i ever saw and one of my favorites everyone should see it i give this film 10 10 stars,1
323,legend has it that at the gala hollywood premiere screening of 2001 a space odyssey about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson yelled out would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about well i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes 59 seconds this movie made absolutely no sense at all who were those people where were those people what were the rules of the game called quintet are there any rules to quintet were robert altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this maybe ol' fast eddie saw zardoz and thought well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense so can i maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff also did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life quintet just confirms what i've always thought when altman's good he's superb but when he's bad he makes stuff like quintet,0
324,as a fan of the book this work is fantastically adapted remaining true to the source materials and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work the intrigues translate well to film by virtue of ron howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity br br i like hanks as robert langdon his portrayal is genuine and earthy with only the barest glint of the kip we all knew and loved back in the day he is a good dramatic actor and while i miss his comedic efforts i do enjoy his more serious performances br br the subject matter is no less controversial than the davinci code and the vatican seems to never learn their lesson as with the aforementioned film the holy see issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global catholic boycott of the film which of course generated millions in ticket sales br br although the story of the god particle was played down dramatically and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction the fiction that was left was entertaining and extremely well done and the truth be known people who have not read the book will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story as the screen version carries the main story well on its own br br in fact it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise in order to enjoy this second which should have been a prequel in all honesty although that does not lessen the effectiveness nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work br br all in all this is good for a friday saturday night's viewing although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones br br it rates an 8 8 10 from br br the fiend,1
325,the of this movie is maddening one moment it's making fun of latin americans american tourists and banana republics in general the other it wants to be touching with burned villages and orphans even the serious revolutionary hero becomes a parody of a revolutionary at one point but the comedy parts aren't even funny because it's so obviously stolen from star wars yes star wars the hero is basically a rogue with a heart of gold add to this stereotypical sounds effects latin americans who speak english with one another and a villain that just disappears from the story and whats the point it's basically revolution propaganda with no resolution and no planning because there is just no way these people can lead a country the us government are bad guys but who'll make money producing this not some poor farmer that's for sure,0
326,the people at abc forgot to do their biographical research so many scenes were just plain wrong the actor playing was very rigid there was no personality there it is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem poll the move is so low budget the script is terrible conversations like you must follow the rules no the people are starving lame plus the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours terrible a better use of your time would be to watch a pbs documentary on also cbs put out a miniseries on that is better than abc by far was a wonderful man and it bothers me to think that my grandkids might get a hold of this abc movie and think that that is what he was really like,0
327,hi y'all br br i bought this on dvd from england you see i have one of those multi region players i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends well surprise to amy jo johnson she's barely in the movie although she is on the cover it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place perhaps someone has a trust fund br br oh it's about vampires who live at the beach,0
328,i'm not sure where to start with this in short it was a disappointing movie having taught the novella i was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie the movie has a couple of interesting lines mainly between alfred and but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella br br for one i was expecting an older and a younger in the book is fourteen but he is described as pure ideal innocent whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease he is an accomplice to he always looks back at him almost in the book it is who steals glances at the boy as for i imagined something closer to the professor turned clown in the blue angel based on a story by thomas mann's brother heinrich than this forty year old with hardly any gray hair in all fairness i do think that dirk bogarde did a good job but either someone else should have done that or he should have made to look older at the beginning br br i know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the apollonian and inspirations and focuses instead on obsession of and does not justify it i liked the fact that music was used because ultimately he did inspire mann to write his story i'm not sure turning into a musician was a particularly good move or the creation of alfred who i don't remember in the book br br and one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips i was wondering if it was dubbed because i expected it to be in italian but then i remembered that each italian movie i have watched has this problem it just bothers me because these directors fellini is the other person i'm thinking of are supposed to epitomize perfection in italian cinema and here are their characters laughing without sound then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces i'm thinking of the scenes when almost collapses and starts laughing this scene could should have been the strongest but it was annoying instead,1
329,this film is simply appalling how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me harvey will try and distance himself from this rubbish it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies you wont miss a thing the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living this film just depresses you as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement,0
330,nelson is a medical professor who wants his four students to put him to death and then bring him back to life so that he can prove that there is an afterlife so they do and soon enough all of the medical students want to know if there is life after death the afterlife isn't about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel but something more sinister br br past ghosts come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone it has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and it makes people wonder somewhat about what happens when you die it's a good movie to see when it's raining and you're feeling down it's also a little weird br br see it with a haunted past,1
331,the house of dracula really has nothing new to offer in the way of chills or thrills or new twists on an already tired storyline this film was made as a hasty sequel to the fairly better made house of frankenstein from a year earlier in house of dracula you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie stock footage from previous films in the series and then the ending from ghost of frankenstein used as the ending here just makes for an el flick therein lies the shame of the studio and the producer considering that they had top notch talent and merely wasted everybody's time and effort on a quick money return scheme but that seems to have been the trend all throughout hollywood at the end of wwii this is what brought on some of those mindless scifi pics of the 1950's with all their closeups of harmless lizards in order to make them appear as dinosaurs the days of james whale and val lewton to mention two were over as far as creating real mood and atmosphere in this genre keep in mind also that the makeup genius jack pierce who actually did medical research in order to create all of our favorites was summarily fired right after this particular film was released a lesser capable makeup man by the name of bud westmore was then hired as the head of this department at universal soon to be universal international not to denigrate mr ability but horror films were just not his forte ok to watch or not to watch watch this film but only as part of the chronological order of the frankenstein series and you'll see how this all ended up as comic fodder for abbott costello,1
332,two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist however the script the direction and some scenes were just awful i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie but knew the movie was filled with flaws br br this film could have been so much better and reached a larger audience accordingly what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film some scenes being painfully bad to watch i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself,0
333,years ago with ray of light madonna broke through to a truly amazing level of musical artistry and since then she's occasionally transcended even her own standards this concert production with its hypnotic editing amazing dancing hallucinatory lighting effects and trance inducing arrangements blows away all previous efforts madonna's apparent ambition to single handedly bring about world peace through music and dance may seem hubristic or absurd to some but hell somebody's got to do it thanks to her assemblage of the remarkable talent of everyone involved in this production confessions tour live from london places her once again among the top ten artists working anywhere in the world in any medium,1
334,after watching this movie on tv i looked it up in the imdb and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7 6 this is not a good film especially bad is the editing the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction it's not very fluently done i do agree that the acting was fairly decent especially kelly and that the story was intriguing enough,0
335,i hate to say it but i really do think this one's overrated and i love jackie's films it's got more plot behind it than usual but unfortunately though it has some great stuff i find it to be a bit slow all in all i say it's entertaining but not great,1
336,okay make no mistake this is a pretty awful film but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort a face burning scene the part with the disfigured bride br br this baby falls into the so bad it's entertaining category to me and for that alone i would give it a star the effects are terrible the acting is abysmal and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning too it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something i actually liked that in this case,0
337,the acting was terrible the cheesy fake cheap green screen effects were ridiculous and the creatures were absolutely retarded the only good thing about this movie was the concept and the laughs i got from watching such a bad movie then i became pretty angry because i realized i wasted 4 bucks on renting it why would a movie like this ever be in theaters i know this movie came out almost 5 years ago but does anyone put any effort into making movies anymore i am just writing random things to fill up space because i need ten lines of text in order to publish this review this next line should just about do it there,0
338,by far the most racist and cartoon for children 7 kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress talk and act like the characters portrayed i am disappointed in nickelodeon and nick jr for agreeing to air this terrible program the wayan's brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers they should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon usually the young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice overs for cartoons and then as they grow older they move up to programs for young adults a good example is nick cannon he first started out with appearing in all that later on he starred in mib ii then drumline and now his tv show nick cannon presents wild 'n out where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes this comment was originally for but i wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on tv not long ago can become those who get involved with non kid friendly programs it is very sad that this happens but all celebs change and grow up it is just the opposite with the wayan's brothers new cartoon it is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos with allowing the young generation watch this program it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it,0
339,oppenheimer was a great series it was the first thing i saw waterston in and it is too bad copies aren't available a similar situation exists for glory enough for all a british series from around the same time about the discovery of i would pay a good price for both of these on dvd is it really so difficult to get oppenheimer on a dvd that is able to be played in the us another very enjoyable series again from about the same time was danger uxb a series about defusing unexploded bombs hence the name that one you can get from your local library br br pete,1
340,one of two movies i have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for even if it just to laugh at how bad it is i never found it for this movie nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects the worst movie i have ever seen,0
341,this is absolutely awful it's everywhere nowhere doesn't have any sort of point i have never understood what is good about jeff or sarah silverman bonnie hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so called script thought yeah i wanna do that most movies i can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny there is zero of that in this it's extremely dumb there really isn't any other word to describe this this is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that i have seen in a long time skip this at all cost you'll be glad you did,0
342,this movie is an obvious rip off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline with everyone else getting killed all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow johnny's brains out he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes why do these people have sex with their clothes on is that supposed to turn us on surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally as if one were watching people in real life instead it was done in a heavy handed and shallow manner,0
343,by watching this film you will not only explore the turkish music but will also explore the city of istanbul with wonderful pictures and scenes from all over the important regions of the city there are lots of delightful conversations with all sorts of musicians and their thoughts about music culture there is also discussions about the mixture of east and west like istanbul has how they make their music how do they see themselves comparing to other country's musicians it consists the music of baba the turkish queen of music an important work of art,1
344,the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter's complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details br br cynthia portrays karen was not a fine election she is a good actress but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter i think that the role needed a stronger character someone with a stronger personality br br louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific she does a great job as karen's mother br br it has great songs which could have been included in a soundtrack album unfortunately they weren't though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries,1
345,i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience in other words the creators planed to make comedy not drama at the end i realized that mr tony was earnest about this movie it's a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a fishy tale poor ryan phillippe despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance what to say for jason statham lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction for this reasons i vote 3 10,0
346,i've been waiting years for the dead to come out on video having pretty much worn my vhs copy to shreds this is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holidays it takes place on the feast of the epiphany twelfth night and is a simple poignant vignette of characters attending a dinner prepared by three dublin women central to the story is a fairly loveless couple a wife who once passionately loved a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same kind of passion for his wife but feels incapable all of the performances are stunning and the script weaves among the various characters at the dinner beautifully of course its source material is james joyce's short story of the same title and much of his narrative structure is kept fully intact john huston's long career as one of hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a truly fitting finale with this film which was scripted by his son tony huston stars his daughter anjelica huston and is dedicated to his wife thank you to lions gate for picking up the rights to this film and releasing it on dvd for lovers of all things irish or for folks looking for a literate subtle yet incredibly moving holiday film this is a true gem,1
347,this is horrific no really this is bar none the absolute worst worst i hesitate to even call it a in' movie it is a ninety minute visual root canal the plot is practically non existent a mad scientist who looks like the frontman from 'the impregnates a woman in his secret lab a lawn chair in what i think may be a garage via an injection of within hours she births a full grown monster who then goes on a rampage thats the whole movie the death scenes these are poorly set up take forever and the acting how can you mess up screaming the victims stand there while the growling wheezing congested freak advances on them and proceeds to limply strangle them for about three days the sets are cheesy the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single yes a big honkin' flashlight the sound quality is poor theres only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is generously described as wooden footage is shamelessly recycled to pad out the movie and the special effects would make any bbc sci fi production shake their head and proclaim they didn't even try the 'monster' is some nameless in a 3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages slapped on in its encounter with the lone cop of the movie the cop fires invisible bullets that apparently travel so slow the monster can dodge them at five paces don't see this movie no really thats not a dare don't see this movie the director should be shot the writer should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be devoured every morning by ed wood enough rentals and there could be a sequel don't let it happen,0
348,time line of the film laugh laugh laugh smirk smirk yawn look at watch walk out remember funny parts at the beginning smirk br br unfortunately this movie has a good concept that it grinds to the ground,0
349,sweet entertaining tale of a young 17 1 2 year old boy controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father and how he finds himself through his work with a retired eccentric and tragic actress very well acted especially by julie walters rupert plays the role of the teenage boy well showing his talent will last longer than the harry potter series of films laura linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption so there's no room to like her at all but the film is a very entertaining film made well by the british in the style of the likes of keeping mum and calendar girls,1
350,the premise of this movie of a comedian talk show host running for president as an independent just to shake things up is funny entertaining brilliant and even a bit inspiring thought about the west wing debate when tom dobbs leaves his podium thought about steven colbert announcing his candidacy good times the first 15 20 minutes of this movie are therefore very very entertaining the debate especially when he eventually get's elected it's a pity that is because of a computer glitch you'd want him to win fair although that is unrealistic br br but after that this movie goes completely downhill i thought we'd get a great movie like 1993 in which we see how it would out if a comedian actually ran the country instead the movie turns from comedy into a thriller a romantic comedy and a drama and does none good the computer glitch becomes the main storyline which really sucks boy is this disappointing i give it 3 stars just for the premise and because i actually managed to watch this movie from start to end without stopping it which is usually a good thing with me,0
351,but it's not the plot isn't all that bad the actors aren't all terrible so it should be decent instead though despite a good starting point the plot just drags on and suffers from a lot of those i can't believe he she is so dumb moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going it frustrated me at times watching some of the decision made by the lead character also it took way too long to get to the good part of the movie anticipation is great but you can't spend over half the movie building it up a shame too since it got decent exposure upon release and hit right before the big halloween season even so i have a feeling this is going to get at least one sequel if not more so maybe they'll be able to build on the strong general plot to eventually release something decent,0
352,would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 may be overall too if it were global when it comes acting badly aka showing attitude yawning over not acting halle berry is no match for while the catwoman had supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume and some action sequences had nothing at all br br one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0 10 yet again i think that movie does not even deserve a 0 it has to be something negative or minus infinity br br ok what about the plot outline it is a giving arrogant full of attitude choreographer meet an useless skill less loafer who aspires to be an actor tale the story is so short that if just another sentence imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler about the story telling its like a bunch sorry 2 people for the most part of people moving in super slow motion don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd player you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd player is struck not its fault at all br br at the end of it all you end up giving some credits to the director at least he realized that both and abhishek bachan at least at that time can't speak dialogues convincingly so there are not too many dialogues in this movie so you can at least sleep your way through the movie with some annoying noises from those song sequences br br do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema once you have tolerated this movie you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it br br there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this,0
353,ok so this film is not very well known and wasn't very well publicised i discovered this fairly brutal gangster gone good movie by complete accident on one of millions of movie channels late on some boring evening but i'm glad i did the opening sequence to this film is fantastically comical in a very dark way this in fact sets what i think is the general tone for the movie i think a lot of critics and movie fans that have actually seen this film have been a bit unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dogs vein ok so there are undeniable similarities between thursday and some other crime genre films that it has been compared to but in all fairness i think this film takes a much more darkly comic look at this type of film and the end result is a engrossing well made funny if not totally original film tom jane is good in this and deserves the recognition he will now hopefully get thanks to the the punisher his performance as the bad guy gone good is realistic funny and just cold enough to make you believe casey really was a bad ass before he reformed thats another thing that makes this film stand out for me the characters in nicks gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever assembled a smooth charismatic but very cold leader nick a trigger happy blood loving sexually predatory bitch of a woman dallas and a psychotic hill billy with brains with a penchant for torture billy hill throw in the most bizarre police detective ever seen on screen beautifully over played by mickey rourke and you've got a recipe for well for thursday really its at times darkly comic sometimes brutal sometimes unoriginal but always engrossing and worth watching 8 10,1
354,this stinker is in mystifyingly frequent rotation on one channel here and i've found myself watching in horror again and again the script is like something one would come up with friends over several too many drinks and the production values match admirably br br it's meant to be a children's movie but features a grotesque and poorly explained kidnapping scene the star dog has a lack of star quality equaled only by the other actors and it in general has the look of being filmed in someone's backyard the climactic soccer game features no more than three dozen extras sadly cheering in the background br br it even all wraps up with a budget ran out voice over sequence when the story to one's relief simply stops the high raters here must be either the producers or the majority of the extras from the soccer game,0
355,in 1965 producer kevin who owns a part of the bond cinematic rights associate with eon productions harry and albert broccoli for making thunderball the fourth film of the 007 franchise the star is sean connery of course br br in 1982 wins a legal battle and can produce an independent bond film never say never again is one of the two unofficial 007 films made outside eon the other is the 1967 comedy spoof casino royale is a remake of thunderball and stars the original bond sean connery who comes back to the role after many years of absence br br the film is released some months after octopussy with roger moore the 13th episode of the eon series at the time press calls it war of the bonds both films are a big success in 1983 even if octopussy earns more money at the box office br br is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians director irvin kershner who led the empire strikes back douglas cinematographer of raiders of the lost ark and screenwriter lorenzo semple jr who wrote the three days of the condor among others br br the cast is excellent with connery a then relatively unknown kim basinger barbara carrera klaus maria brandauer max von sydow edward fox br br although all that the film remains inferior to the original thunderball it lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real bond movie there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the james bond theme m and q are not played by the traditional actors it's a copyright reason eon only is allowed to use these elements briefly lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere br br on the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable brandauer is a very good villain and the women basinger and carrera are sensual and gorgeous but the main highlight is sean connery he's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in diamonds are forever his last performance in the role of the british super spy before,1
356,let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy from the opening scene our protagonist solo giovanni ribisi shows himself to be a self absorbed feeble and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook keeping his word or forming a coherent thought i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self absorbed self pitying lowlife i didn't develop any connection with this character he didn't seem to care and so neither did i i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point br br the dog was not a character in the film it was simply a prop to be used neglected scorned abused coveted and disposed of on a whim so be warned even though dog is in the title this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers br br scott caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend cad don cheadle is sincere and magnetic i always want to see more of him on screen mena suvari was delightfully repellent lynn collins role of a stripper with a heart was well acted but the character was simultaneously absurd and clichéd not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisi br br romantic hardly comedy if you say so,0
357,for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that i've seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddiness br br this is of course milligan's take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for there's not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victim's tit br br so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious 3 out of 10,0
358,may contain spoilers sadly lou last film has the distinction of being slightly better than abbott last movie together dance with me henry this movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire dorothy is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable you can't blame lou costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light in my opinion lou costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the irs if you look at the last 3 4 abbott costello movies you can notice the magic was gone check out dance with me henry now that's a painful movie to watch,0
359,this documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and amazing experience a documentary can be if done so well as this the subject mark is smart funny and very driven and this story of his personal fight to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to harbor an impossible dream see this,1
360,i usually seek to find good in movies even the bad ones unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain br br i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love rosemary's baby so much what a mistake that was it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy though thankfully very few are as bad as this in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be movie recommended very highly for not viewing at any time ever,0
361,the beguiled is a pretty satisfying film for those who are after the things above for clint eastwood's die hard fans it will be a disappointment although eastwood does his best here in his so atypical role except for the fact that his character is a charming womanizer which he isn't so unacquainted with the ambiguous nature of his character which goes from being a sort of fallen hero to a manipulative and insatiable woman eater to put it that way will eventually be too much to handle for anyone used to see him play heroes in the best western tradition morally a bit unclean but still without that dark side i think he manages to pull this unlikely part off but those who really steal the show are the two women the geraldine page and the head of the students played by elizabeth hartman br br we see that there is a potential devil in every man and a potential witch in every woman especially when it comes to sexuality and sexual desire hartman's edwina is the sweetest most innocent girl in the world until she becomes infatuated with john and becomes possessive of him this is what causes tragedy as well as the secret lust the forbidden fruit she carries a great and ugly secret about her incestuous relationship with her brother whom she clearly idolizes still the fourth factor in this unholy love spiral is the wicked carol played by jo ann harris who lures john away from his crush on edwina and into her bed br br the whole nature of the story gives this film a sort of gothic feel which makes it a pretty rare thing in the western genre but a popular thing in the movies of the 70's a unique achievement by the siegel eastwood team and a movie not for the faint hearted,1
362,what's up with this movie does mr lyne and his writers think that a sado masochistic fling between two screwed up yuppies can carry a feature length movie maybe if it had some comedic elements which is doesn't at least intentionally or there were some additional dramatic elements which there are not or maybe if it was hardcore no it's simply the history of the affair a chronology of a bunch of r rated trysts ho hum who cares nine ½ weeks deserves every razzie nomination it got it's a loser br br and by the way what's up with roger ebert and his rave review where was his head back in 1986,0
363,seriously i couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie for some reason the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting and yelling like cro magnon bipeds i understand that this was about gymnastics but seriously what's with all the roaring and human bleating i also saw at least five actors with overactive syndrome and stage 10 syphilis br br although this movie has actual human acrobatics i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns this is truly a milestone in the history of film making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely or sound br br incredible,0
364,there's only so much that i can take of filipino films especially nowadays where the trend is sex action and slapstick comedy which i hate the fact that ka man made me think and made me gape during the movie was a big plus it's got good cinematic scenes and editing was great especially the cinematography i think that claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie milan the fact that there's only so few filipino movies that i really like i think laurel did such a great job in this movie i truly truly loved this movie technically and character development wise the plot was complex and that's what made it terrific,1
365,the aristocats is classic disney at it's best it's not considered as the ultimate disney classic along side the more well known disney films but it's a well made and fun film that certainly deserves to be a disney classic aristocats is certainly a sure kids pleaser cause it has all the components for a fun kids film i'll liked it very much as a kid i'm not sure if this film is a sure pleaser to the adults who could watch disney classics for the nostalgia sake but i still enjoy this film as an young adult br br storywise aristocats may not be so complex or innovative but it doesn't matter this film was made on that period where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were the story and wise versa which aristocats certainly shows the characters make the film they're all likable fun have great lines and have a great interaction with each other the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling eva gabor as duchess phil harris as thomas and etc a misconception could have been the dogs napoleon and lafayette since they're showstoppers and haven't so much to do with the actual story but fortunately they're fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold br br aristocats is both entertaining and cute but it's also a very funny cartoon the animation style and look fits perfectly for the film's french surroundings especially the city of paris looks greats the character animation and design is great and the songs are really catchy too my favorite is scale and but the title song is a cute song along with thomas cat and the memorable show stopper everybody want's to be a cat and the score by george burns is a perfect fit for the film funny and emotional situations br br overall aristocats is in my opinion the best disney cartoon from the 70's and it's a film that deserves to both be seen and remembered so what you're waiting for do your self a favor and share this disney classic with your kids it deserves to be in their memories,1
366,my wife wanted to see this movie and i grudgingly went along i have never been a big fan of the biopic believing that cinema is more exciting when it isn't structured in non fiction beyond that although i like ray charles' music just fine i don't consider myself a fan of him or his music br br i expected to either suffer or coast through this movie br br i was wrong br br this is an engaging story told in a classic cinematic style the realism is in the nuances the tilt of a character's head after a dramatic moment or the look in their eyes while they sing i literally discovered myself involved in this movie during the course of viewing it br br jaime foxx of which much has been said heads a cast of immaculate re creators of not just a time but an era a life that never really existed to those of us under forty this movie sinks the audience into time without the gimmicks and grand sweeping panoramas of titanic or other period pieces of that ilk this movie doesn't present you with the 50's and 60's music scene it takes you there br br this is a movie about ray charles but your appreciate of it should not be limited to the story of his life this is the kind of movie like saving private ryan or schindler's list that does what a movie should do bring you to another place another time,1
367,a very bad film an amalgam of clichés and historical inaccuracies a few examples in an early scene soviet infantry are attacked by the germans instead of staying in their trenches to shoot at them they advance into open ground to fight them contrary to all infantry tactics kate one of the central characters is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her russianness yet she does not speak russian a guilt stricken german airman attacks an anti aircraft gun the gun however does not fire shells but scores a direct hit on his which doesn't look much like a german of wwii in fairness when they could escape the preposterous plot and the consequent absurdities there are some genuinely powerful moments the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving but these only show up the rest of it even more a film to be avoided,0
368,naturally in a film who's main themes are of mortality nostalgia and loss of innocence it is perhaps not surprising that it is rated more highly by older viewers than younger ones however there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the film which anyone can enjoy the pace is steady and constant the characters full and engaging the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of tears to show emotion screams to show fear shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger naturally joyce's short story lends the film a ready made structure as perfect as a polished diamond but the small changes huston makes such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly it is truly a masterpiece of tact subtlety and overwhelming beauty,1
369,after reading previews for this movie i thought it would be a let down however after i got my region 1 dvd the dvd was available before the film hit the uk cinemas i was pleasantly surprised strong performances from all cast members make this a very enjoyable movie the fact that the script is quite weak means that you dont get bogged down in story and therefore the repeat viewing factor is greater i recommend this movie to one and all br br,1
370,i say sadly because if you see this movie now you realize how low our media has sunk all the warning signs are in this movie br br it's a great film i think the last great james brooks film but others may disagree it has rich characters who are believable as well great acting great writing and although the music got a little cheesy i even liked that br br william hurt has never been better holly hunter is stunning and albert brooks walks away with every scene he's in this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it's vital and important topic of the news and how it's slowly being compromised in our nation br br watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening,1
371,i found an incredibly frustrating film to watch it starts quite well and moves along briskly until the first which is a doozy after that it becomes very lazy and underwritten as a story it was the case of the plot driving the characters and not the characters driving the plot if you hate film where you can't understand why characters do what they do you will loathe particularly the last act is odd and seems to occur in a world without common sense also at the end one of the characters confessed a past misdemeanor to her friend rather than generating sympathy from the audience most people started to giggle this was probably because the of the story was a complete idiots finally there is an ending which just seems tacked on to be 'shocking' and comes from the horror cop out school of 'people are bad audience so just accept it without any br br is neither good or bad but mediocre and annoying,0
372,i haven't written a review on here in ages but rewatching all of bottom tv show live shows and this i felt i had to make my views on this movie known it is i feel the perfect comedy movie it lacks the lovey dovey story lines i wouldn't really call with gina love would you or him and eddie going up there naked not love that make the rest of comedys go from good to crap it lacks the usual dilemmas that one must overcome in most other comedy movies unless you count the fact that they poisoned the guests and must escape from the guests green vomit as a dilemma thats similar to other comedy movies no this movie just sets out and succeeds in doing one thing and one thing only making one laugh what does one require from comedy movies laughter this movie just piles on laugh after laugh without stuffing up the laughs with serious crap like other comedy movies thus i call it the so far only perfect comedy movie ever made and i will never ever stop watching this beautiful movie i rick and on such fantastic genius,1
373,i loved it others have revealed spoilers but i won't it was an unusual premise actually sort of weird but i went along with it completely camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly maybe that's why some people hated it but i think sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly without being maudlin or ridiculous i don't know why she was even interested in a loser like james franco but married him anyway i like him as an actor and also thought he did a terrific job he has nothing to be ashamed of there have been movies with with similar setups e g ghost i simply love sienna miller and went along with the situation as written in the script i feel her great acting talent is vastly underrated and hope it becomes more recognized by the public i thought all of the actors played their parts very well and hope more people get to see the movie i highly recommend it i was surprised that my local block buster store had about 10 copies available i definitely plan to buy it,1
374,a show about an incredibly dumb man child and his shrewish hot wife 99 of the plots revolves around doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable a either he hides it from his wife or b tell his wife she him and then it's up to the father in law arthur the typecast character from seinfeld to aggravate the situation br br and the writers dare to say it was influenced by the honeymooners an absolute classic and that the plots are drawn from real life situations unless you live in a cave you know that's not true br br anyway let's just put it this way if kevin james had been thin the show would have got canceled the pilot if you're 12 or you're fond of fat jokes be my guest watch this show or any of kevin james movies for that matter br br i've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like friends seinfeld and everybody loves raymond i'm still wondering how could anyone do that,0
375,this was the first feature film for just about everyone involved including director teck tan so they deserve credit for pulling it off but this film was awkward in its direction preachy in its style exaggerated in its acting and overly politically correct the plot was all over the place preventing any aspect of it from developing well gangsters get involved in the story though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic they could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result br br the plot is about a young ethnic chinese malaysian who returns to his home country after studying in the west his studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of malaysian charts a rather juvenile premise the beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped unceremoniously br br the film tries to take advantage of wondrously diverse ethnic mix but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy there is a pretty scene of malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural br br the acting came off as somewhat amateurish and the male lead was particularly unconvincing the female malay lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark the film also has an openly gay character and though he is a bit of a caricature he provides some of the funnier moments in the film but the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama sadly this film which is not in the least offensive has been banned in malaysia 3 10,0
376,i saw this film when it was released to theaters it's definitely one to remember i had forgotten the title until recently a friend found it via online search br br one dark night is rather unusual for the suspense horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways it's a nice old school film with props and scenes that reflect the times our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for example br br as has been mentioned by previous reviewers one dark night is currently available on dvd the original negative was not available for the dvd transition some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesn't take away from the story that being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very good br br adam west plays a rather part in this film as son in law his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully short br br the story builds over the course of the film unlike many horror films of the era one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening br br the final 20 minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum pull the coffins out open them and move the corpses around attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes the rotting worm riddled corpses look quite real,1
377,pretty disappointing i was expecting more of a horror thriller but this seemed to be more of an episode of dawson's creek but with out the acting there were some very impressive shots though almost worth seeing maybe future efforts will improve,0
378,i must say i thought the show greek would be really ridiculous and stupid since i am part of a sorority i didn't want them to make greek organizations look bad br br but i think greek is hilarious yes they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it's not mocking but just cute humor br br all the characters are pretty likable minus rebecca logan i just can't stand her casey and rusty have good chemistry as brother and sister then there is who doesn't love a guy like haha his character brings so much to the show room mate dale played by clark duke is hilarious as well br br it's definitely fun to watch so tune in for season 2 i can't wait till it is back on,1
379,normally i don't like chuck norris films i appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually fairly well choreographed chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats so in my local used bookstore i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home br br while the acting in this movie was worse than most norris films i was hoping to see at least one fight scene i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical norris film rather it was a christian film destined to illustrate the good will win out paradigm br br there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film with the exception of the label goodtimes entertainment which i had never heard of before i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company br br i don't have a problem with christianity i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing if someone is going to make a religious film at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only 3 25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight at least it was during supper time and i spent some of that cooking and eating br br in short if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film and not hoping for much don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that,0
380,poor jane austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation so many great jane austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies i despise the man in the gray flannel suit and the 1969 version of david copperfield my main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book jane austen was poking fun at the gothic mania in her society and much of the novel is tongue in cheek the movie however is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically the lighthearted fun poking flavor of austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray horror meets period drama the scenes of catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting also henry is dreadfully unappealing why i ask would anyone fall for him if you are looking for a fun filled jane austen evening watch emma instead,0
381,everything about this film is simply incredible you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child br br i do feel it is important to note this tale is about child abuse don't rent it for your kids thinking it is a fun disney esque film,1
382,this is an excellent movie that tackles the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way great performances all round but absolutely outstanding acting by sidney poitier br br he makes this movie breathe and alive his portrayal of a guy who struggles against discrimination and violence is simply mind blowing his acting is forceful and delicate and subtle at the same time truly worthy of an oscar poitier had to wait because of his skin colour for many more years before the sheer brilliance of his acting was recognised by the academy br br cassavetes turns in a great performance too withdrawn troubled and realistic as it has become his hallmark he and poitier contrast the forces of cowardice courage and human transformation through friendship br br the movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the us the irony is that it somehow mirrors the realities under which poitier had to work,1
383,as the mom of a 3 year old and a 2 year old i adore aristocats it is a movie that contains no double entendres no almost swear words like heck or darn no parents who are functional idiots and no crotch smashing or flatulence jokes that are so prevalent in even the best kids movies these days the story line is sweet and interesting the music is great the love story is quite romantic the kittens are adorable and the various other characters are unique and attention capturing the action is simple and not overwhelming or confusing the characters are quite well cast as well i love listening to eva velvety voice and there are so many others that are familiar from childhood and also fit the characters so well it's really a movie about love tolerance good manners and faithfulness who doesn't want their kids exposed to these values it is a movie that i don't mind watching over and over unlike happy feet where i couldn't watch the whole thing even once because it was so irritating i wish production companies would move toward making movies more like this one,1
384,primary plot primary direction poor interpretation,0
385,alexander nevsky is nothing short of a grand film on a grand scale the film opens a window to a world and culture most americans will never become acquainted with and much has been said and written regarding the film's thinly veiled patriotism in the face of imminent war with the german nazis br br by us standards the acting is a bit stilted the screenplay is short on words and big on visuals and action and while the action can become tiresome the visuals are often stunning direction is incredible br br on another note fans of ralph bakshi animation might notice that he stole a lot of his visuals for wizards directly from a copy of alexander nevsky,1
386,i came across this movie on dvd purely by chance through a blockbuster rental voyage to the planets is an excellent bbc 2hour documentary drama about a future grand tour of the solar system taking pains to adhere to current knowledge about the planets and space flight and plausible from existing technology this movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to venus mars jupiter saturn and pluto br br the special effects are excellent for a tv show i found the actors believable as astronauts the situations presented are for the most part plausible and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight only two minor complaints i found some of the situations and dialogue somewhat maudlin at times furthermore i am unsure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once time more than likely visits to venus mars jupiter etc would will be separate missions br br they didn't try to skimp on this show with production values the scenes of venus and mars were actually filmed in the northern deserts of chile the driest area on earth and a dead ringer for the martian landscape sequences were filmed in a diving russian transport jet the producers could have fudged on either of these using studios and cgi but chose the real thing instead br br i would like to especially mention the marvelous music that was composed for this movie don davis's thrilling theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts as the magnificent shot of the pegasus passes the screen and david suchet intones it is the destiny of man to explore the stars br br watching this on a small television screen is one regret i have what a thrill to see this in a movie theatre or even better an imax presentation,1
387,my favourite story from 'tales from the crypt' brion jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack axe swinging madman steve dixon having seen him before in tango cash i can state this actor never got the proper credit he deserved a jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed and you know when dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay the young worker ted billy wirth receives an almighty beating from dixon leaving him blind now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work a tribute to black humour if there ever was one the co stars do a pretty good job too supporting ted when dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues one even stated he became a changed man when he got married though ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could,1
388,at first i thought ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films as someone noted earlier the movie does not look poorly made it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot better angles better sound equipment good looking actors and nicer locations br br however the improvements are all purely superficial if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters ka man' would feel just like your typical second rate local movie hyperactive drama predictable plot twists yeah right moments crying screaming and characters you could care less about all shoved down your throat br br a couple of things annoyed me about this movie first of all since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family that not blood related argument does not make an ounce of difference second would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped simply because the father told her to keep it secret and where the hell were the lights in this movie i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my tv set,0
389,extremely boring i don't care how many avant garde bones you have in your body this baby sucks and don't go and see it because i mentioned that save it for warhol's empire it's far more entertaining i have seen other films that were far better so i am dumbfounded why this is considered a masterpiece as an art historian i have had to consider radical works by marcel chris burden and damien hurst and in these artist i can still see artistic intent even quality and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art as for india song it's not even soft porn nin was almost here g rated slide show of sex and a voice over that does not relate to the slide show movie pure crap and not even campy sadly just a bore and a waste of 2 hours to add insult to injury the print i saw was faded and scratched to hell harvard film archive if i want to see entertaining boring i watch bunuel yes india song hold your head high to late modernism and be truly bored watch a 70's porn film with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down you'll get india song but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screams of the vice consul,0
390,if there's one thing i've learnt from watching george romero's creepshow it's that if you stumble upon an mysterious old crate that someone has obviously gone to a lot of effort to hide just leave well alone there's probably something nasty inside br br obviously professor gordon crowley robert englund's character in brooks monster isn't a romero fan 'cos he busts open the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard only to ancient demon that possesses his body initially causing him to eat and vomit rather a lot br br when the demon eventually erupts from body during chemistry class and begins to transform the students into hellish flesh tearing beasts it's up to plumber jack brooks trevor matthews to try and stop the foul creatures armed only with a length of pipe and fuelled by a lifelong hatred of all things monstrous br br the dvd packaging for jon low budget monster flick promises one hell of a fun ride offering cheesy thrills and spills of the kind one might expect from your average 80s creature feature toothy critters rubber monster suits gruesome gore and absolutely no cgi and for the last 15 minutes that's exactly what viewers get non stop splattery effects a silly tentacled jabba style demon thingy and mucho macho monster mashing br br it's a shame then that the rest of the film's running massive 70 minutes or mostly spent following jack as he goes about his boring everyday business plumbing visiting his shrink going to chemistry class and upsetting his girlfriend if you think you might enjoy a film that focuses primarily on coping with childhood trauma and anger management buying spare boiler from a hardware shop and the chemical properties of sodium then this is the film for you but if it's a massive dose of monster mayhem you're after then i'd advise looking elsewhere,0
391,pilot mitch jeff morrow sees a ufo while test flying a plane but nothing shows up on radar then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase it turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing but what is it and why is it here br br this has all the right elements for a classic it has an actually pretty entertaining script i was never really bored the acting is good for a 1950s monster movie morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and mara is quite good as the requisite female love interest she's also strong and takes care of herself even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie the problem here is the monster dear god it's terrible it looks like a deranged turkey it has a long neck a hilariously stupid beak some teeth a few strands of hair on its head and claws and oh yes it squawks not roaring squawking the actors had no idea what it looked like it was added after production actors morrow and were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended producer sam katzman was responsible for this he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever and you can see the wires moving it too this gets 4 stars only because morrow and are so good and the script is well done it gets no stars for the pathetic monster wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever,0
392,some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979 that much said it really is pretty dire br br never mind the laughable back projection or the awful awful camera tracking of supposed in flight objects it's the stunts that the concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity barrel rolls loop the loops and violent evasive maneuvers left me wondering why the air forces of the world didn't just fly as their main fighters br br so here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheese fest br br 1 the concorde is at least as agile as a phantom 4 jet fighter br br 2 you can fire a flare gun at mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out br br 3 if the flare gun fails to discharge do not drop it as it may then go off br br 4 the concorde can dodge up to two sidewinder missiles fired at it at once br br 5 a flare will distract a heat seeking missile every time br br 6 switching off your jet engines is a sure fire way of throwing heat seeking missiles off track if 5 above fails br br 7 when performing a crash landing in the concorde it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand br br 8 concorde pilots are all combat trained veterans br br as you might imagine this film is not very realistic the effects are primitive by today's standards and that coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the concorde performs makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn br br not recommended not recommended at all,0
393,it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley cinematography and adam film editing and above all no sense of what goes on in mexico city the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city but it is unable to do it it is a shame a lot of film wasted an american woman tries to find her brother who has been the first account of the story is powerful and interesting very realistic but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city when dealing with an issue like this one compare as an example with frantic 1988 which deals with a similar issue something similar can be said of the role of local authorities compare as an example with todo el poder 1999 the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself paying little or no attention to the rather weak plot and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico us border and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city only the producers of this movie it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish,0
394,this movie deserves a 20 10 if i could give one the hollow is a great hercule poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people i am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel there was no major difference that i could spot the only difference was that poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel the acting was superb and the music as usual was amazing quality david suchet is perfect in his role and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either in no other movie that i've seen so far has poirot been portrayed so brilliantly hats off to the producers they have made a movie that i along with many others will cherish for a long time to come,1
395,of all the 48 films of brigitte bardot une parisienne is widely regarded as one of her best what we see is special for once the plot has a value of its own does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for sex charged appearance br br this film is your true well worked out light comedy with a good and coherent story set in france's government circles in the late 1950's it entertains from beginning to end providing many amusing twists turns and some slapstick all acted out by at least three starring leads including bardot br br une parisienne french for female inhabitant of paris focuses on telling a story not on showing brigitte bardot brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies br br when you settle on your couch on a friday night tired and weary from a week's slaving away just turn on une parisienne this film will make you feel better,1
396,everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film on no budget should see this documentary the determination of everybody portrayed in this project was very moving to me and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of show business be it film music or writing i think the film makers could have done a better job with foreshadowing the events that led up to this film becoming a documentary perhaps by use of a narrator other than that the film comes off as a real example of how show business isn't about the show but rather the business br br i hope that the actual intended project repo man ii gets to see the light of day i think the film makers did a fine job on it with what little they had to work with and all that they had to overcome to complete it,1
397,i would like to vent my displeasure at nbc canceling las vegas the show had been top notch for the past 5years tom addition was great he really brought a nice fresh addition to the show what does nbc have now lame reality and night time game shows i mean come on keep the old and tired law and order not even putting jack mccoy as da can keep the show interesting gee let's keep quality program like deal or no deal or ed er should be put out to pasture to nbc is worse now than it was in pre seinfeld cheers days with cable and internet nbc cannot afford to fall flat on its face please bring back vegas i remember when homicide life on the street ended the way it did at least they had a two hour series final hey cbs are you listening please pick up vegas it is a great show,1
398,i'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct because they manage to criticize u s wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the u s does war well but doesn't clean up afterward thus the seeds for future trouble furthermore they do this without making the enemy and without making republicans the enemy since it's the republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing bringing down the ussr by covertly supplying a war in afghanistan br br but seriously now do we really want a movie that repeatedly says let's go kill some russians like that's the greatest thing a red blooded american can do and are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes even his supposedly smart assistant who is always dressed professionally keeps looking at charlie like he's just the most wonderful handsomest greatest guy around as if she's nancy reagan to his ronnie julia roberts does a bang up job in her role but basically women are really demeaned in this movie and it was really annoying,0
399,i have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography i found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the cliché lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and did'nt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasn't satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didn't make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me i recommend this movie to no one,0

401,the most intense and powerful film i have seen in years there have been other films before that delved into the vietnam vet but nothing compared to this emotionally heartwrenching film as a typical american suburban family circa 1972 comes apart at the seams revealing the scars that vietnam has left on our all of our collective souls the cast is a fantastic with all four actors with kathy bates a stand out giving riveting performances what is wonderful about this film is that you take no sides but understand all four characters and empathize with them even though all four have divergent viewpoints and needs there are scenes in here that are so powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed such as the confrontation between son and mother that will have you emotionally drained and in tears of anguish i actually cried in this film something i rarely do the shocking end is a stunner a much overlooked film that should be seen i rate this 1996 film a 10 10 a superlative piece highly recommended especially in this day and age with again our country embroiled in a hideous war our headlines shouting of atrocities and again our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars with their deep pain of deeds done in the line of honor a must see film,1
402,it is sad what they are letting into film festivals these days i had to sit through over twenty minutes of this dreary short that wasn't funny at all to get a good seat for a feature film that i wanted to see at a local film festival the festival paired this horrible short with a great feature i am just glad the feature was good otherwise i would have not been a very happy camper br br for a comedy short film it got no laughs the title says it all,0
403,in my opinion flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego he was disrespectful to his dancing partner tried to upstage everyone and had no awareness of the spirit of riverdance it's well he left the show colin dunne the new male lead is superb and when he and jean butler dance together magic happens eileen fiddling is astonishing as is noel percussion and maria fire dance is worth the price of admission when pages and get together near the end of the show for a musical duet well it's a genuine treasure i agree the editing isn't complimentary but no technical shortcoming can quell this extraordinary tour de force this is the one to get there's never been anything like riverdance this is the real one,1
404,here's why this movie fell very short of its potential i don't read much so i don't care what the novel was like 1 i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan it was stiff and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic he had no humanity 2 they screwed with the story maybe that's how the book goes but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were me tarzan you jane jane is the first human tarzan encounters i did like the natives a bit more than the midget in weismuller's version but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy 3 tarzan is primarily a love story i'm sorry but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture that qualifies her for a supporting role at best supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other not enough screen time sorry not only was andie mcdowell's over pathetic most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0 i never believed they loved each other which made the belgian dudes closing voice over quite frankly silly when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle he feels an urge if you will a feeling he's never felt before jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out the untamed side of her its this chemistry that the story of tarzan not that lord dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him even a good face lift couldn't help this movie it needs massive internal reconstruction oh and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place final judgement 4 out of 10 sorry tin man and by the way if you want to see real acting drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio,0
405,killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1 bad acting bad characters annoying clown bad lines you name it honestly i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes they didn't this movie is just as bad if not worse than the first one that clown that goddamn clown i hate him i hate him so much and i don't hate him because he is a good villain i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is the last thing we need is a killjoy 3,0
406,oliver stone hits the bull's eye with this film aided chiefly by electrifying screen presence and biting brilliant screenplay every moment crackles with a steadily growing tension climaxing in a truly memorable movie going experience if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile into a seamless union of creativity then this is it the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame br br an ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity and self sickening hunger for the next big thrill br br a film not easily forgotten i highly recommend it to anyone interested in the darker side of human nature,1
407,great movie post apocalyptic films kick ass this one is no exception kept up the pace and interest without a speck of dialogue mainly through some good character development the fight between reno and the hero was tight i also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval like weapons to show how primitive and savage mankind had become without their technology and the connection between the beginning and end was a little spacey that is i had a hard time understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence in sum kick ass character progression design story without the cushion of dialogue and most importantly the always appreciated desolate scenery of a post apocalyptic wasteland,1
408,this was just an awful movie i've watched it once when i was roughly 12 i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie br br i still feel sick whenever i think about it it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie i really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish it's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie i can enjoy the dumbest made for tv disney movies as much as the next person but this is something else completely br br usually i don't like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself but believe me i am doing you a favour do not watch this movie,0
409,debbie boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song you light up my life the didi conn film of the same name however was a horrifically embarrassing flop conn plays the stereotypically goofy homely vulnerable girl who is in love with michael who plays the stereotypical yuppie wannabe guy they are engaged but every one knows that isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built so only didi is surprised when he dumps her needless to say didi is quite embarrassed br br fortunately she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty she calls it can you guess you light up my life she hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life now i recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city and thinking well thank heavens we've finally got all the exposition out of the way now maybe something interesting will happen and something interesting did happen the credits rolled br br yep that was it not only was the movie badly acted badly written and badly filmed it also ended in the middle this movie is a really profoundly bad movie and we're not talking cult movie bad here we're talking unmitigated flop a real yawner from start to finish if you liked the debbie boone song by all means buy a copy of it but don't waste your time or money on this flick this is one movie you'll be glad you missed br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer,0
410,i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made the postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since 'robin have i seen this costner full of depth and complex emotion kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in butterfly effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i've seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie it's not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible that's what i think good film making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work bravo,1
411,the plot a trucker kristofferson battles a corrupt sheriff borgnine by getting his fellow truckers to band together and form an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and soon creates a national media frenzy br br the negative the film's setup is weak and the ending even weaker it has all the good ole boy trucker clichés without adding anything new in the process it ends up making smokey and the bandit look brilliant and inspired kristofferson is much too laid back for a leading man role and cannot carry the picture borgnine's character is portrayed awkwardly at the start he is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who overacts to a minor contrivance that starts the whole thing rolling then at the end he is made out to be a little more sympathetic and even secretly siding with kristofferson which doesn't work at all in either case jackie gleason is a much better actor for this type of role the worst part about the movie though is director peckinpah's attempts to throw in a message' into this silly action flick that does nothing but slow it down and bomb in the process br br the positive the only good scene in the whole film is the fight sequence inside the truck stop restaurant director peckinpah puts a funny spin to his trademark 'slow violence and the result is amusing unfortunately he starts putting all the action into slow motion during the rest of the picture until it eventually becomes tiring mcgraw is always a pleasure to look at but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do br br the lowdown if you've read the synopsis than you have essentially the movie the song that this movie is based on is pretty good but the movie adds nothing to it and should never have been made this is all very uninspired stuff for such a maverick director br br the rating 3 out of 10,0
412,i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings it totally sucked i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie even an ok movie none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean spirited or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas when this takes place i know canadians and like them but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again a colossal waste of time and money do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was worth watching this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia too don't mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking unless they had ulterior motives maybe s he was the director or the producer if so i'd like to ask them to give me back my money if your money is important to you save it instead of renting this piece of drek or rent something anything else i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick if so i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs,0
413,this is a typical college comedy and its very average the story is ok but not very entertaining its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a his got a girlfriend though a nice one btw anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds br br the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell the ending is bad really bad it destroys everything about the movie you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie br br 2 10,0
414,this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover my first impression sweet full moon crows a scarecrow holding a scythe ok my impression i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago perfect a nice slasher film to start the evening with wrong absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out but thought i wasted 3 on this so ill finish it wheres the scarecrow well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots you see that every so often i was watching this thinking ok when are those brats gonna run into this dude at one point i thought they died but no i mean their still alive i only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were one was the zoom in part at the start the director actor writer says remember i had that feeling well i have it again and it was either a zoom in or zoom out to hell i'm checking back but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look ok she believed him im sorry but yeah i didn't know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed not only that they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear br br the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the scream in the camera to make it scary ok filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins right i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie br br to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something cause seems the bad guy had just a stick not even an ax someone should axe the dam production film br br don't fall for the picture this movie is a piece of sh t i watched the trailer and guess what it has br br girls where are you talk to me and corn,0
415,my main criticism with the movie is the animation i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film which is much better also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static it is also a shame that michael j fox didn't voice milo he did such a good job and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or aladdin i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline the third story was confusing and clumsily told and the second story suffered from poor scripting to make things worse the first one i can't even remember other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that however there was some nice music and good voice talents from john mahoney cree summer clancy brown and tom wilson that saved the film from total disaster all in all a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film 4 10 bethany cox,0
416,its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder did kieslowski mean that or is it in my head for instance is the judge meant to be god or some supreme being br br also irene jacob as in the double life of is outstanding there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does br br also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to valentine be,1
417,may contain spoilers br br clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections i just can't see it any other way what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name br br anyhow where to begin the bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over the top characters and more inconsistencies than george w bush's college career i don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack were getting killed also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film how do we know it's him like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs a great camp film but a very bad film overall,0
418,this movie shocked me it was so realistic and the story was incredible touching they talk german and russian which makes it more believable and real this is a must see movie the actors are great too really a good piece of work the plot takes place within a german troop in wwii they have to go to stalingrad sovjet to fight against the armies you get more connected with every soldier in this group and follow them through all the perils as they get captured within stalingrad they get face to face meetings with death blood grief and the coldness of russia this is a must see movie and you cant afford not to see it,1
419,an unflinching descent into psychological and physical oblivion that will undoubtedly burn images of the truthful brutality and suffering of war into your cerebral in a way not many other films will in fact there is simply no other war film like it br br director kon ichikawa witnessed the unthinkable horror of hiroshima first hand only 10 days after the bomb was dropped he has said that from that day it would always be his mission to express the pointless empty violence humans inflict on each other and themselves br br mr ichikawa shows us that there are no winners in war for the paths to victory and defeat are paved with the same soldiers marching down roads which only have death and destruction at their end br br mr ichikawa succeeds in bringing his message to the world thru this haunting piece of cinema,1
420,obviously someone was looking at catching onto the blair witch wave br br this movie was set up like all the reality haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately and i must admit i get a kick out of these but this movie is much cheesier probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the participants going through the house whining give me a break spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time any paranormal happenings are blatant setups no strings but too perfectly caught on camera to be real the participants were not very likeable either two goofy guys who don't take it seriously one girl who scares at the drop of a hat and the quintessential over played paranormal person is this becoming the clichéd formula for a ghost movie br br i have to admit the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes i admit i spent that time pacing in the kitchen i really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers even if it is pg13 br br if you're looking for some entertainment if you don't take it seriously you will get a kick out of this movie there's tons of situations to make cracks about if you're looking for an great story line look elsewhere,0
421,this movie certainly deserves to be placed within the genre of horror but not for obvious reasons the horror of a tale of two sisters lies not with sudden shocks or large helpings of cgi guts and gore it is a psychological horror movie which the viewer's curiosity from the start and builds a suspenseful aura of mystery and questions throughout best of all the ending does not provide a clear answer pushing the viewer to analyse what they have seen and make up their own mind about what really took place br br do not be put off by the seemingly slow pace at which the movie begins and don't expect to be jumping out of your seat immediately this is not the conventional hack and slash movie with orchestral stings designed to make you scared of nothing in particular a tale of two sisters slowly builds an atmosphere of terror a terror of the unknown and a fear of things which evade explanation until the very end even when the final conclusion is revealed it is not so heavy handed and obvious as to make the entire film fall neatly into place the movie requires its viewer to reflect back on what they have seen and to try and square this with the frightening revelation of the final scene some things will still be open to interpretation and this is one of the joys of watching a film such as this br br the true fear of a tale of two sisters lies not in shocks or conspicuous scares it is a psychological gut wrenching horror that defies convention and expands a genre to proportions hitherto unexplored by the traditional horror film it is no exaggeration to say that this film stands apart even from the so called 'asian horror' genre indeed it would be a mistake to align a tale of two sisters with films like ringu and the grudge this movie can be understood from a variety of standpoints some requiring no suspension of credulity others embracing the supernatural wholeheartedly br br whichever way you choose to interpret this film it is one that demands an open minded approach rewarding viewers regardless of their preconceived notions on asian cinema or horror in general,1

425,well i think i've finally seen my last woody allen movie i read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good woody allen experience as i've had many times in the past well that was not the case this movie has nothing to offer even with the wonderful performance by the talented sean penn this movie failed one of the features of his other movies is multiple characters variety witty dialogue this movie basically consisted of only one character very one dimensional it had almost no laughs it probably looked good on paper i think the only thing special was the performance of samantha morton now i'll be looking for her movies in the future so in conclusion this movie was a major disappointment,0
426,i watched this movie about six years ago and i recently did so again if i remember correctly i did not like it at all the first time and i appreciated it slightly more this second time br br this movie is obviously on a big budget the effects are mostly top notch except for one or two impacts and the cast is impressive however there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show br br firstly whoever decided that peter stormare should act as a crazy russian astronaut should be fired being a swede and a fan of peter i'm pretty sure he can play a russian character well but his performance in this case is plain stupid both with respect the lines uttered and the acting so something must be wrong with the script i'd like to see peter as a professional russian astronaut instead br br secondly the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch it is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath in addition to this the events that unfold are simply not credible i'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie br br finally the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action biased the shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of migs at zero safety distance while bouncing off car sized ice blocks like ping pong balls the director should watch apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these br br i like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching the overall performance of the actors is great apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow br br with some minor changes this would have been a 8 10 movie i'm sorry it isn't,0

428,black eye 2 outta 5 stars unimaginatively filmed '70s action movie looks like it was made for tv only the occasional cuss word and a subplot about lesbianism tip you off that the movie was actually made to be shown in theatres fred williamson plays a tough guy ex cop who becomes a tough guy private eye he stumbles upon a couple of murders and attempted murders linked to a mysterious cane there are some fistfights a bullit inspired car chase a fairly original elevator scene and even time for williamson to confront the rich lesbian lover of his girlfriend teresa graves there is also a scene with williamson bullying a poor old man by tearing up some priceless old autographed photos in his memorabilia shop yeah way to go tough guy maybe you can find a cripple to beat up later obviously meant to cash in on the success of shaft this and about six thousand other movies this movie doesn't have enough edge or enough originality to make much of an impression,0
429,i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way special meaning retarded the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting boring camera work nothing really driving the story and of course the acting is horrible it wasn't even bad in a campy way it was just plain bad there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture and if some decent actors were cast i wouldn't recommend weekend with the babysitter unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie,0
430,i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15 i hated it then and watching it again just for the hell of it it's even worse now you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling commands like zoom zoom zoom the are no special effects just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain this is utter crap and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it whoops i need 10 lines well this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras this sucks actually yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst if you can make it through this you can make it through anything,0
431,one night at is one of those films that starts with an awful amount of promise but as the film goes on it becomes silly and loses it's way big time liv tyler plays a manipulative woman who tries to get her own way by flaunting her body to every man she meets all of which fall under her spell there are a few funny moments in this but they get fewer and fewer as the film deteriorates into a comedy farce michael douglas who plays the assassin is good as is liv tyler although she does look like she had put on a bit of weight since this is ok but is only memorable for the scene in which liv tyler washes her car you will know what i mean when you see it 7 out of 10 just,1
432,i saw this film at our crossroads film festival and was looking forward to it because it was filmed in mississippi and starred karen black i was severely disappointed by the clumsy script which never flowed and the apparent lack on the effort of the actors and director to understand anything about the culture they to portray how did lee and griffin become such deep friends in five minutes which of the two were f ing the girl under the tree it was unclear and there seems to be some law in hollywood about southern accents and rarely do you hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south despite the awful this must be how they sound just soften the r approach to dialogue so many times the actors lapse out of it altogether especially sounded like a new york street tough during emotional scenes and nobody sounded at all walt character was supposed to have been from morgan city louisiana yet sounded nothing like that city's blend of new orleans and cajun accents the other bothersome point seemed to be an urge by the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual urges inside him before i start a firestorm here and am accused of homophobia i've enjoyed many films with gay love themes notably punks when love comes and b monkey but this seemed to be some man's wish about all young men well tennessee williams has already covered this ground and did a far better job of it so i wonder if the coen brothers can get regional accents and culture dead on in films set in minnesota and in mississippi why can't anyone else what a waste of my time,0
433,i adore the chaney version of phantom and i appreciate webber's version if only for the growing interest in the book wish i find more of a mystery slash horror with the romantic aspects downplayed i don't approve of the fact that andrew lloyd webber made the relationship between raoul and christine less restrained br br luckily since this is a comedic short with only erik and christine this version doesn't even have to bother with any other characters br br i thought i would still be waiting for another version to match up performance i was dead wrong leslie nielson is fabulous as erik though of course this is a spoof it's still brilliant br br i especially appreciated the fact that erik looked more like a living corpse than an accident victim i still have as of yet to see a phantom like that other than br br however i do not recommend this short if you don't like spoofs because this is in no way supposed to be taken seriously,1
434,am glad that i am not the only one to find this series very good this is the best series for young ladies i have so strange taste on comedies and i find so hard one to please my intelligence and i am so happy that their humor is exactly what i need love the gang of actors if anyone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one i say pretty please write back because i miss the series br br and kindly ask the writers and the producers to continue it even if the actors are now all grown up i guess br br have a nice morning day evening night because i do not know the exact time you will be reading this post,1
435,what i miss most of all in this film is that it lets no place for imagination everything is said it is like a documentary film but not as good as a documentary because it is no documentary a patchwork film without a continuous story very superficial nothing to think about because the film tells you already what you are supposed to think too many different problems are touched but none is worked out in order to make you think i do not even know if it is a funny film that wants to be serious or a serious film that wants to be funny many scenes are very unrealistic and the acting is quite poor the film is quite boring,0
436,irrespective of the accuracy of facts bandit queen is a true story its true because the themes it deals with hold as much truth today as they did way back in 1994 this movie is violent powerful and thought provoking the protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood whose adversity brought out the best or worst out of her keeping the subjectivity aside there is no doubt that character from a young girl of 8 who is married off by her father to clear a debt pun intended to a gang leader who goes on to become a leader of the lower caste has evolved into a champion in her own right her portrayal is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a massacre br br i can understand if the western audience is not able to appreciate this masterpiece bandit queen needs to be in the indian context and not just checked out in stereotypes i may not be able to sell it on its universal appeal but its certainly a must watch for the indian audience its a shame that the movie had a delayed overtly censored release in india br br bandit queen is the story of a woman who fought against two odds in india being a woman and that too a lower caste her rebellious nature and inability to just give in caused her the most horrible experiences in life which only went on to strengthen her into a self proclaimed goddess she responded to violence with violence and dint become the submissive woman society wanted her to be call it divine justice or failure had she killed a single person she would have been hanged she killed 24 and got revered respected and glorified br br p s whoever found her character psychotic needs to be sodomized at 8 by 10 men at a go and paraded naked then they should be asked how normal do they feel,1
437,i thoroughly enjoyed this made for tv movie i was channel surfing and came across the start of the movie boy am i glad i stopped this movie has a real hot cast as well as a semi believable plot there's drama comedy action and best of all the human nature aspect of this film is what makes it great i hope it comes out on video because i will buy a copy rating 9 out of 10 stars,1
438,jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the manila bay br br it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism the film uses edwin war in a not so subtle montage the performances are just adequate at best jim brown is okay but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed the sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in tora tora tora the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching for me the film seems to have half a real plot the retrieval of the silver and half a plot that is there just to fill time none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale br br given the choice i'd take a pass,0
439,as long as you can get past your puritanical instincts and realize that are people too you'll realize the depth p t anderson gives to his characters also an incredible soundtrack the songs are so tightly tied to their scenes you won't be able to hear them without thinking about the movie again br br philip seymour hoffman is worth the price of admission alone,1
440,spoilers spoilers i loved the set up and consistently laughed throughout the entire movie the acting was great with my favorite part being howard's kevin kline attempts to be a manly man the fiance and parents did a great job as a supporting cast spoiler warning the acting of his conservative family's acceptance and attempts to be polite were heartwarming and believable my only problem with the end was the fact that howard was actually gay the movie is set up as a be who you want to be but the movie actually does the opposite howard's logic behind his discovery is the fact that he loves barbra streisand's movies and enjoys dancing to music his mannerisms and tastes appear to be gay and it isn't until it is pointed out to him that he realizes it rather than setting howard free it pigeon holes him oh he likes to dance to music than he must be gay his confession at the marriage felt like a bending down to society's wishes in the end the movie becomes a gay rights movie which was not the original course it almost becomes bland with the rest i believe the movie would had been ultimately better had howard been straight it would have been truer to the message,1

446,this movie is awful i can't even be bothered to write a review on this garbage all i will say it is one of the most boring films i've ever seen br br and the acting is very bad the boy who plays the main character really annoys me he's got the same expression on his face through out the movie i just want to slap him basically 80 of the movie is slow motion shots of weird music and utter sh t br br apparently i've got to write at least 10 lines of text to submit this comment so i'll use up a few more lines by saying the lead character has got one of those faces you just want to slap br br meh i give up this movie sucks,0

450,where do i start the plot of the movie which is about a love between two high school students during wartime while one is a living weapon and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot it is based on a manga by shin takahashi which was also turned into an anime in 2002 both of which i have yet to read or see br br this review is about this live action adaptation however sadly this honest to goodness was a terrible movie it isn't as if one could site certain aspects and say for instance the budget is at fault or the acting is to blame it is sadly a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film down br br the acting is poor not to say aki maeda and are bad actors but they didn't have much to work with and seemed miscast neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degree br br the script was weak the leads act unrealistically and behave irrationally the film also plays for the heartstrings but ends up being predictable all the while not being compelling and under developing the characters there are also pacing issues br br visually it is unremarkable the film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes the other special effects also have a cheap look to them especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used there is also no visual flair as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulating br br the music and sound effects were fine but unremarkable br br overall the movie isn't devoid of enjoyment and fans of the series shouldn't be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion people unfamiliar with this probably isn't the place to jump in as it isn't a very good movie or melodrama it isn't the movie or the cast and crews fault it just isn't inspired and that is what kills it,0
451,kazuo komizu who hasn't made one decent film directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its japanese release br br yes it does feature scenes of rape gore and dismemberment but so what it has the style of a bad american porn film shot and badly photographed by ed powers dirty debutantes and is incredibly slow br br it seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti social acts br br there is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced br br just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this on the contrary that kind of fan myself for example tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning it's a shame production companies don't realize that br br one reviewer here commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it i disagree the subject matter is never the issue the issue is how that subject matter is treated in entrails of a beautiful woman it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring br br personally i like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior with an intriguing context if the material is well directed freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing this horror pink hybrid is woeful,0
452,the problem with other actors cast in the of dorian gray is that they either looked too old for the part hurd hatfield helmut berger josh david gallagher ben barnes or that they were unable to pull off the english aristocratic manner without being stilted dorian is the perpetual 19 year old or so all milky skin and locks as described by wilde so the challenge is finding an actor that has the maturity and range for the part i e who can portray the callousness and but at the same time looks like someone in his late teens and peter firth pulls it all off in this excellent british tv adaptation br br gielgud as henry while considerably older than what wilde had in mind does wonders with his scenes wilde's have never sounded so natural and unforced especially george sanders in the 1945 version was pretty feeble by comparison and his costume didn't fit br br finally jeremy bratt plays basil as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio again a fitting interpretation in general the film includes enough gay subtext without turning dorian himself gay he's all things to all people and supposedly there's no drug or sexual perversion he hasn't tried in the 18 years covered by the story but that makes him more than homosexual he seems to equally wreak havoc on both sexes here as he should according to the novel br br of course the budget of this production was not very large so everything feels a little stagey particularly encounter with sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio look also the final shot of dorian a puppet i suppose in his white toad like make up is more hilarious than convincing and death scene is inadvertently funny also as far as i recall basil should have been killed seated at the table br br but all in all this is a very worthy adaptation i'm sure wilde would have liked it the only thing missing is the sensual side not so much sex scenes but wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers luxurious cloths and precious gems isn't really explored here i e the aestheticism is completely missing but like i claudius the excellent acting makes one easily forget these shortcomings of production values,1
453,ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie br br i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog but not much br br nice things first there are some hilarious moments the elvis impersonator for instance actors seem well casted also the russians is great and goldblum is very good which brings us to the downsides of this movie first of all there is hardly any story and the end we know already wins so no drama or suspense they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above but that story kind of evaporates br br more importantly the film does not represent reality the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny they are a serious and dangerous lot i am willing to believe that flying in some spin doctors from the states helped win his campaign but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are who financed the campaign what did they get in return how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials br br so what we have here is a film loosely based on reality but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller without plot or subplot,0
454,at first i honestly thought it would be a corny movie but after seeing this i was quite surprised amanda bynes was convincingly funny along with the supporting cast especially that character played by bullet tooth tony from snatch what a contrasting role between those two movies now i'm not one to say whether or not an actor is good or not but her act especially was thoroughly enjoyable even though the plot devolved into a teeny bopper love triangle though very funny half way into the movie i feel that this shouldn't discount what i think the movie really is simply entertaining so if you happen to stumble upon it whether by dvd or theater i'm confident that you'll enjoy,1
455,i was actually fairly surprised to find out a movie based on the far cry game had been created the story here is not something i would consider to be a strong point in the game universe no worries though as in typical boll fashion the story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on now i understand that certain liberties need to be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another but it seems like he really just doesn't even try to make a connection not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke it has been said a million times before but why couldn't someone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie,0
456,this film was just on two nights running on itv1 dear oh dear someone actually bought this on the strength of robert ok i missed the start but what i did see was so bad i thought no i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it nothing was based on reality i doubt things would progress as they did in this film everything was poor about this film ok cgi but no reality the write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end sorry i wasn't impressed yes formulaic couldn't guess the end from what i saw the military had the upper hand people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing it just wouldn't have happened that way it was worse than leave your brain at the door it was annoying as someone else said yeah right of course that would have happened not the credits mentioned quebec and canada so it was a co production missed the third party concerned i'll have to check back on this site i'm not usually this critical but this annoyed me,0
457,when the episode was made and aired eisenhower was president kennedy was president elect br br as for the episode it was a passable episode if not a bit earnest the professor shows not much range here and the whole thing seems a little rushed a lot of episodes of the tz seem to not fit the time slot some seeming like they're crammed in and rushed some with little or nothing to it spread out over the half hour and some of course fit i guess you just expect a little more tension than to be taken back to some rooms and drugged but overall a decent episode indeed the what if motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and sets the table of with basic interest br br 7 out of 10 considering there were a lot of tz episodes not quite as good and some a great deal better,1
458,i watched it because my friend said we could try it when my father asked if we'd watch it i didn't want to because it was such an old film how could that be good i finally did watch with that friend and my father my friend and i loved the film the songs are great the actors were cool and we were crazy about it i guess this shows even though it's from dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good film i bought the film not so long after seeing it on tv i put it on a lot and sang along with the songs i even watched it with my classmates on my birthday party it's a nice good and sometimes funny film br br if you don't try you can't say it's bad even if you think no i'm not going to watch a film from dad's time try the first part of the film you can always stop watching if you don't like it i really recommend it it's great,1
459,are sea side resorts the sad dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels certainly this movie along with the near contemporary don't look now depicts venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap for a more light hearted approach see just married with ashton kutcher and brittany murphy having never been to venice i can't say for sure but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from luchino visconti one of the great of world cinema having seen the movie i now wish i had gotten around to reading the thomas mann novella it's based on which also inspired an opera by sir benjamin britten since i don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition i'm left wondering about dirk bogarde 's obsession with young is he a homosexual a pedophile or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent perhaps reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung fu at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace the film benefits from the ravishing music of gustave on whom character is clearly based dirk bogarde gives a moving performance and the movie is graced by the presence of one of italy's great beauties as mother,1
460,this movie is a little slow in the the beginning for about the first 10 minutes or so but once it kicks in you can't turn it off adam beach and rose play the best parts and are great at their acting job you would never be able to guess who the killer is i gave this movie a 9 because at some parts adam beach needs to speak up a little so you can hear what he's saying br br 9 10,1
461,i chose to watch this film because i am a stephen nichols fan unfortunately i am unhappy with mr nichols' choice to do this movie the film was slow badly acted and included some very graphic sex scenes of mr nichols' character with a very young woman watch at your own peril,0
462,this is one of the greatest films ever made brilliant acting by george c scott and diane riggs this movie is both disturbing and extremely deep don't be fooled into believing this is just a comedy it is a brilliant satire about the medical profession it is not a pretty picture healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons who spend all their time making money outside the hospital and yet you really believe that this is a hospital the producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases this movie really reveals how difficult in is to run a hospital and how badly things already were in 1971 i loved this movie p s i noticed that the incompetent wheeler dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in la law the young doctor played in lou grant i also noticed that the registration nurse has appeared since in becker and other shows,1
463,this is a love story set against the back drop of television news the three main stars william hurt holly hunter and albert brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the washington bureau of a tv network br br tom hurt is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star jane hunter is the producer who recognises that tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist but falls for him anyway aaron altman brooks is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her br br holly hunter was nominated for a best actress academy award but lost out to cher moonstruck she was robbed this is hunter's film her character jane is smart ruthless and totally driven she is also hilariously neurotic her performance is perfect just watch her face when she watches the tape of tom's interview of a rape victim the scales literally fall from her eyes br br wiliam hurt's performance is less showy he plays a man who is well aware that he is a and a fraud but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like jane he gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating br br the film comments on celebrity journalism integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line it predicted that news would be dumbed down that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures br br think about this this film was released before the end of the cold war and before rise of reality tv yet it predicted the dumbing down of the news paris hilton's release from jail was treated like a major news story to see how prophetic this film is just watch your evening news and note the set the graphics and the presenters tom and his clones are well and truly alive,1
464,the connection with james dean in a short plan we see emilio estevez toying with a teddy bear remember the first scene of ray's rebel without a cause moreover the main conflict is estevez versus sheen father against son as in east of eden the soldier has come home and nobody has been able to communicate with him even his sister a psychology student what a derision the mother a crude matron a superb kathy bates gets bogged down in she 's not able to understand that her values religion family have become a thing of the past specially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed the father an irresolute man under his wife's thumb although he tries hard to play the macho wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life so he saved his honor by forcing his son to do his duty the scene in which hatred for his father explodes is very intense the actor director gives a restrained performance as lee students used to do and his final burst of anger is increased tenfold so,1
465,low budget but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story this movie is also known as lady frankenstein the alluring frankenstein sara bay fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks baron frankenstein joseph cotten is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick supporting cast features mickey hargitay paul paul muller and herbert a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere still a fun watch,0
466,audrey i know you truly cherish your husband ted's memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books br br it is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you,0
467,i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of becky sharp's story is a b film the casting of loy in her first top billed role is rather fascinating br br before loy became mgm's reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles she was an actress vanity fair was loy's follow up film to emma in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper marie dressler br br loy's becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins' version 3 years later in becky sharp loy's becky is very much a pre code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways it's the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set that's what makes her fallen character so tragic br br in counterpoint to loy's grasping becky is the goody goody amelia barbara kent who is just not an interesting character mary forbes is good as mrs most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah conway as walter byron as osborne anthony bushell as others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness billy bevan as joseph lionel belmore as crawley montagu love as the marquis irene as polly the maid as the housekeeper br br loy is front and center throughout while the ending is rather shocking she has several excellent scenes such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another woman's winning roulette bet the more loy's becky descends morally the more beautiful she gets until she is finally caught bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen,1
468,everyone told me to see cactus flower and i finally did what a wonderful movie the perfect pick me up for a sunday night dreading monday morning matthau and hawn were good but ingrid bergman really made this movie after all it was really about her the truly great actors can do anything and miss bergman proves it she shows us in the course of one film a range few people display in their entire career the scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion i found myself cheering for miss dickinson as if she were the boston red sox thankfully she made out no pun intended much better,1
469,this show is up there with the best comedys made in australia as it makes fun of pretty much anything which is what lots of our public want some of the best bits in the show are the ad road test which tests out how an ad would do in real life what is really great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people the chasers who love doing what they do and who would n't this show has loads of bits in it that can crack up anybody like the ad road test which i've already mentioned mr ten questions where he asks 10 questions really fast in front of famous celebrities like hugh jackman and the beach boys temporary ones like the chasers emmys and ones that have been there from the start like what have we learnt from current affairs this week overall i rate thin show 98,1
470,one of the more prominent popular episodes but clearly one of the worst a red shirt female falls for khan instead of dropping dead for a change and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non existent character trait on the ship makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in wink of an eye when a red shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love same as in ss however in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft headed easy to impress morons who once they fall in love with the enemy are capable of doing just about anything the fact that switches back to kirk's side doesn't the illogic in any way lord and the lord br br why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength that's one of several st plot devices that undermine kirk's intelligence why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach i was half expecting to hear the the in the background at any moment why the hell would kirk or any ship captain provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots br br ss is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder trekkies love it it doesn't have too many sci fi elements in it which is what trekkies hate the most it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which you guessed it had far too much sci fi for the average tiny trekkie brain,0
471,i really enjoyed this both times i watched it and both times i walked away thinking about it and the morals of the story a great deal i agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centred around the sci fi aspects you might expect from an alien on earth movie but rather is about the human condition the characters in the psych hospital provide a great insight in to that and how they go from hopelessness to hope this movie has touches of sadness to humour to sympathy to the final is he or isn't he that final question was well handled and even though some might argue you don't know what happens in the end and the question goes unanswered i feel it is done in far more detail than something like say the movie ronin with robert de niro where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it i highly recommend k pax 8 10,1
472,obviously influenced by the success of pal's destination moon and x m this one just doesn't make the cut limited special effects a thin story line result in a production that even the half decent cast can't save just no believability here no one seems surprised to encounter martians much like earthlings etc etc pass on it,0
473,estevez martin sheen and kathy bates are superb in this portrayal of a vietnam vet home from the war but still haunted by it bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a family sheen is terrific as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through but is too wrapped up in his principles to really empathize the setting is thanksgiving day and the relatives are coming for dinner estevez who plays the returning vet wants no part of family tradition and insists on wearing his combat fatigues to dinner explaining this is what i wore last thanksgiving the bickering and family arguments are priceless particularly the peanut brittle crisis but the ending is both gripping and terrifying it has to be seen to be appreciated br br overall one of the best movies i've ever seen,1
474,having previously seen this short on vhs tape with the feature summer stock i just rewatched every sunday on the tcm site it marked the film debut of 15 year old deanna durbin and of 14 year old judy garland outside of her two older sisters these two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from deanna of il bacio then one from judy of waltz with a swing before the two climax with americana the slight plot of this 11 minute film concerns the possible unemployment of durbin's real first name which is the way she's addressed here grandfather's conducting job at the park because of low attendance with the two girls' help you can probably guess what happens from there contrasts are marked not only with garland's and durbin's musical choice but also with their height poise and movement despite all that they perform quite well at the end and it's almost surprising that m g m chose garland while durbin was already contracted at universal as this short was made but was briefly allowed back in since her feature debut three smart girls was in the early preparing stages judy herself would make her first feature parade at 20th century fox as m g m was deciding what movie she would next star in that would be broadway melody of 1938 where she would perform the show stopping number dear mr gable you made me love you but back to this short every sunday provides a warm and wonderful glimpse of two star singers at the beginning of their legendary careers unaware of what the future holds for them,1
475,the jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a clint eastwood movie br br in fact the whole thing strikes me as burt doing clint the story is good and the movie is full of one liners that i carry with me to this day reynolds to bad guy i'm gonna pull the chain on you pal because you're f'n up my town and you wanna know the worst part you're from outta state br br highlights the reel to reel is nice set dressing for br br charles durning coming unglued while listening to tapes of prostitutes having sort of phone sex you'd have to see it trust me it's hilarious br br brian keith plays against type as a tough guy and does it well br br bernie preoccupation with zen br br rachel ward wow where'd she go br br doc and the tonight show band play their rears off as usual joe william's guests on vocals manhattan transfer re recorded route 66 the soundtrack lends class to the whole affair br br need i say more it might be reynold's best film ever br br yeah he plays himself as usual but it works br br enjoy,1
476,hal hartley has been likened to a modern day william shakespeare by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter he certainly knows how to assemble a cast and once again martin donovan is sensational whilst thomas jay ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable although the film is only 1 hour the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast tracked race right till the very end without a doubt hal hartley is one of the best directors to come out of america in the last 20 years with a vision that is unique funny and heart warming,1
477,this is a romantic albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites it is one of the many classics of the 80's genre like pretty in pink or some kind of wonderful br br nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley preppy girl julie it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end br br true most of the acting sucks but br br i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since he's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential br br if you love 80's movies you will love this classic br br go rent it,1
478,i'm sorry but star wars episode 1 did not do any justice to natalie portman's talent and undeniable cuteness she was entirely underused as queen amidala and when she was used her makeup was frighteningly terrible for anywhere but here she sheds her god awful makeup and she acts normally and not only can she act good she looks good doing it i'm a bit older than she she's only 18 and i have little or no chance of meeting her but hey a guy is allowed to dream right br br even though susan sarandon does take a good turn in this movie the film belongs entirely to portman i've been a watcher of portman's since beautiful girls where she was younger but just as cute there's big things for her in the future i can see it,1
479,a cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes although you can't help but think of how low former '80's comedy golden boy steve guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production and playing a hard man too the plot is simple the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it not bad of its kind but not in the same league obviously as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air the cast is good though with sean bean reprising his brit bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as goldeneye and patriot games,0
480,auteur stephan explores the depths of love passion and brotherhood and the devastating results of loss in his latest film br br diegetic world is exploding with suspense and takes the audience on a twisting to the core of the human soul a director he manages to draw the human spirit from the performances of his actors superb editing especially in the flashback scenes and beautiful cinematography is a thought provoking suspense from beginning to end thriller which leaves much to the eye br br what an accomplishment for stephan br br   cheers stephan angela sander,1
481,i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them an aussie has no business in ancient rome nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script kevin connor and lee have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits,0
482,now please move on because that's getting on my nerves br br seriously the man behind brilliant pieces like my own private idaho and to die for and others not so brilliant movies i e the unnecessary psycho remake started an experimental phase with gerry which reached its peak with the thought provoking elephant last days had some interesting aspects but was very uneven while paranoid park his new film also has good looking 15 year olds walking around and not much else some cool references to fellini the soundtrack some beautiful pieces by nino and the elegant cinematography by the legendary christopher doyle in the mood for love are the highlights but the movie is just too artsy fartsy and meaningless for its own doom we've had much better coming of age stories and paranoid park brings nothing new i don't see anything artistic about seeing excessive shots of gabe in his underwear or showering or when and 13 year old taylor momsen the little girl from how the grinch stole christmas who plays his cheerleading girlfriend have sex for the first time just because she felt like they had to do it and after they're done she calls her friend to say how amazing it was and you can say from face how traumatic it was everybody knows that they're starting earlier and earlier nowadays movies like thirteen and even elephant itself which shows how lost their minds are in general not only when it comes to sexuality have done a better portrayal of that gus tries to be minimalist and artistic but the final result is just boring and uninteresting his next project milk a biopic about harvey milk starring sean penn will hopefully bring the good old gus back because frankly this obsession over underage kids is almost creepy 4 5 10,0
483,many americans are lazy and this has manifested itself even in our dvd watching many of us don't like to take the time to read an hour and a half or more of subtitles so we choose not to see many foreign films one film that is totally worth your time no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle reading is however is the green butchers it's by far the best foreign film i've ever seen and tops many american films i've seen lately as well it's a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue the character depth derived in this film is amazing the way and sorry if those are spelled wrong feed off each other's contrasting personas is downright spectacular the actors were well cast and i'm very much hoping that a sequel is in consideration it needs very little of and what's her face just give me and on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue to the author of this fine screenplay i say write more the story itself is rather twisted but you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhow with no remorse please check this movie out,1
484,i was living in ca in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane played an poor attempt of bonnie and clyde needless to say it never went over well maybe this is why it never made it to video even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie the movie was dull and pretty much pointless by the way dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down,0
485,congo is another multi dollar adaptation of crichton's works like jurassic park the lost world sphere etc the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence i'll make this short and to the point the scenery is beautiful the actors well it's the best they can do the script try hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that there were some silly moments like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava and amy raised by humans surrounded by humans yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her what sort of twist of common sense is that which brings me to this if there was an annoying character in every movie amy ranks of one here you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her neat idea but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk congo is worthwhile to see and not deplorable but certainly not a memorable film either,0
486,i am 13 years old and i am writing this review in my mom's sign in she will write her own review later br br this is my all time favorite movie it was filmed in england in 1944 i watched it so many times when i was little that i wore out the video tape i love this movie and it changed my life the beautiful landscapes the mighty pie bold thoroughbred horse the plain little irish village with the young girl who wanted to do what no other girl had ever done compete in the grand national in london with her most beloved horse the pirate it all made me want to ride horses which i have done now for 7 years and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them it's a ground breaking movie about winning against all odds overcoming your fears believing in yourself and reaching difficult goals by working very hard also the horse race scene was one of the best ever made and i have seen many movies with horse races i never get tired of watching this movie everything about it is perfect especially if you are a young girl and passionate about horses,1
487,that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising in our post enron era do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort but will respond with barely concealed rage it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces br br what's really irksome with these kinds of films including purpose is their pretense that behind the glitter there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile in purpose i found no such meaningful message what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth the two main characters nauseating in their do very little actual work instead they party they play golf they strut their coolness they sound hip with dialogue straight out of mtv culture speak rock my world and now get back to partying that's an order john is smug self important shallow and smirks a lot robert who wears funky little glasses is even worse br br the film includes two youthful garage geeks who look and sound like they're right out of the film antitrust 2001 stereotypes are played for all they're worth and in this film also include chic looking computer equipment and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy duty partying and with the time bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years br br about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco the film would have been a lot more enjoyable a lot more entertaining if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration,0
488,this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies i've ever seen i'm seriously considering buying a copy if i can find one dirt cheap to chase away unwanted company it's honestly that bad i view it as some kind of anti personnel weapon if you're the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage then this movie is a gem just to be fair kelsey grammar's character has 1 line that almost works but doesn't quite other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top and the movie doesn't even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the oh and the narrative structure is ill conceived pretentious and amateurish it has failed on both style and substance if you really hate someone invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town an all midget western from the 1930's and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions,0
489,i can't even describe it it's the worst movie i've ever seen i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie just another big budget made to someone who doesn't like to think much it's not even scary it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this thing to trick movie fans i guess big producers make whatever they want br br just get a big producer hot chicks allthough horrible actresses and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so and you'll get the nun br br and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible,0
490,problems 1 although billed as a loving tribute to poverty row a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films much of it is from rko's the most dangerous game 1932 with some from the silent version of the lost world 1926 br br 2 much of the old footage is just used as filler the old shipboard footage or as silent shots for example of bela walking looking or staring often repeated br br 3 where is the pantheon of poverty row master thespians bela boris lon chaney jr george zucco john carradine buster crabbe tom neal etc emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes as in woody allen's what's up tiger lily or steve martin's dead men don't wear plaid even mike nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized reefer madness is funnier than this br br high point the long but extremely enlightening lecture by gregory which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela john carradine and george zucco that's worth the price of the dvd alone,0
491,i just recently stumbled upon this show when abc family had an all day marathon before season 2 premiered i remember seeing previews for the show back in 2007 and thought it would be short lived and not very well written because it was on abc family br br never doubt an abc family show this show surprised me in the best way possible not only is the show well written story lines are realistic funny and enjoyable i was expecting a lot of talk about relationships something like this guy dated that girl who dumped me for that kid etc but this show is anything but the characters are appealing and you really feel a connection between them all there is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel like the stuff is happening right before your eyes br br don't doubt this show it is truly enjoyable to watch and get hooked on,1
492,the story of how the communist leader who freed the congo from belgium imperialism was eliminated by the western powers through the hand of a story of struggle and injustice of hope and the search of freedom the story could be the one of any african country a very moving film with images full of symbolism and beauty if you have to see only one foreign film this year see this one,1
493,this is a film that really makes me cringe in 1951 mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons with amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories then in the late 40s a new style of animation began to appear such as the crusader rabbit series on tv animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money unfortunately columbia picture's cynical ploy worked instead of the public hating the toons as they should have many accepted them and the oscar people ampas actually gave this film the award for best animated short giving legitimacy for an inferior product unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios resulting in rather crappy cartoons later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone and for this tragedy i blame in part gerald one of the of cheap cartoons the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying incessantly is a pain,0
494,i rented this movie for about 1 50 the most complete waste of money and time i have ever spent it's lame i couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this br br the plot there is no plot everything you'd expect to happen it does only in a worse way the acting was horrible my dog could've done better the special effects have no effect whatsoever except inducing complete disbelief and the cheesy lines i mean why even bother br br the only credit i can give this piece of sh t are the opening scenes they were actually quite pretty and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film br br total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower,0
495,this film is a study piece for my english class but it's depth and meaning has amazed me since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice well recommended br br story a girl named well off jewish patty bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her playhouse in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone,1
496,this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since 1978 90 of the special effects are lifted from piranha 1978 up from the depths 1979 and humanoids from the deep 1979 it makes piranha ii the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list,0
497,this movie had me stuck in this endless loop of thinking about it for days afterward granted i am not the movie snob that some folks around here appear to be but i thought this was amazingly well acted and a powerful creation if lacking a little subtlety in i happen to admire movies that can effectively recreate the sensation of watching a stage play it creates an eeriness that works well with this flick i am also a great fan of alan rickman so that might be my bias personally i found the lack of spatial landmarks a good thing this could in fact be anywhere and probably is i say go easy on what was a powerful experience for me and likely for anyone involved in any sort of political activity,1
498,le 2004 is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed from the contrasting landscapes to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits we are taken by the director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel we like the hero will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven mafia world that the film resists mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful the concrete grave the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming are laid bare and exposed for what they are just brutality and business and no more life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self family or others our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison the consequences of love are indeed beautiful and brutal at the same time see it,1
499,my opinions do not flow with the majority in most cases i tend to lean toward the artsy imaginative and different this movie was reminiscent of frances ford's the black stallion wherein a fantasy situation is created to showcase the beauty of a magnificent creature who's not readily available to view performing at its peak except on these multitudes of documentaries ala natural unlike those nature films this offering utilizes the finest movie making techniques the industry has to offer fit for a diva creating one of the most sensual super stars the cat on the screen br br this fantasy depicting the love relationship that develops between a french soldier he is very nice too lost on the egyptian desert and a female leopard he encounters when he chances upon an abandoned egyptian temple is mesmerizing i bought into it wholeheartedly if you are the least bit open to fantasy and appreciate the grace beauty power and sensuality of the feline you should enjoy it br br the only flaw in my book was the ending it was a perfect set up for a romeo and juliet finale that would have taken me over the top br br,1
500,bess was the very first movie my parents ever took me to see even at the tender age of 5 years i was so greatly moved by the drama that i cried aloud at the screen crown please don't take bess i was fortunate enough to see the one tv broadcast of bess so many years ago and now all i have are the great memories and the record album to remember this wonderful wonderful movie i have been waiting and wishing and hoping that one day i might own a copy of bess but it doesn't look like it will happen what is the hold up obviously there is enough public interest in this movie to warrant a release after all these years i remember it and it sure seems like i'm not alone this movie is brimming with human emotion jealousy lust anger bravery determination bess is a buried gem that deserves to be brought forth into the light for a new audience to admire and an old audience to relish,1
501,a movie like this doesn't come along too often i'm surprised it took 9 years to finally see it politicians and civilian hawks should view this before making decisions on how the destroy peoples lives i watched this the day after viewing the tv version of uprising about the warsaw ghetto even with this fresh in mind i felt sympathy for the german soldier i felt sympathy for all parties that this tragedy could happen it will take awhile to thaw out from this one i'm surprised they have not made a movie based on the forgotten soldier by buy this movie shares the cold with the book both will haunt me for the rest of my life,1
502,a young woman jodie foster is witnessing a mafia murder reports the killing to the local police and becomes herself a hit target by the mob operatives a professional killer dennis hopper hired by mafia is stalking her to prepare for the hit but eventually he falls for her then as a parody of the stockholm syndrome that defines a case when an abducted hostage begins to like and cooperate with the kidnapper jodie foster falls for her abductor too make love and both prepare for a getaway br br denis hopper the actor tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of dennis hopper the director the result is disappointing and fails to keep pace with the artistic level of a great performer as dennis hopper is there is no real thrill and the script is sometimes naive and predictable the film is saved to some extent by the performance of jodie foster who is not at her best but still shines with her talent beauty and gift of historical interest is the short appearance of vincent price and in a small act of charlie known from his great part in wall street br br if you decide to spend the 116 minutes to see the film it is not a complete loss this movie offers easy entertainment but we would expect much more from the director of easy rider and the actress who gave us the character of sarah tobias in the accused,0
503,this film is a sleeper because rod steiger's is the only big name in the credits yet all of the supporting actors fit well with his character it was fitting that in his last film rod steiger reminded us once more of his inventive power as an actor he portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness stubbornness and acceptance of the end of life in a characteristically individual and convincing performance because his character was close to death the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us the privilege of life relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us his search together with his grand daughter for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting expecting a highly charged climax such as the meeting of two long separated elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in forever young i wondered how the meeting would be staged and how tightly my emotions would be wound by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest i was delighted to find that the story brought more than i expected the delightfully satisfying climax brought for me a greater appreciation of the value of the precious gifts of life love and family that are enjoyed today by me and by all of us,1
504,directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz a young mother selma lidz andie macdowell is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid john is a little lacking in the emotions department unhappy with the new home situation their sensitive son steven nathan watt decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny michael richards and melvin lou until his mom is well steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits he even decides he wants to change his name to franz set in the early 60's this drama is a bit comedic change that to zany not being a macdowell fan unstrung heroes assures my attitude albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste,0
505,no is a very high rated anime in almost every review page you'll find on the web so i really wanted to know why and i was anything but disappointed br br if you can get past the very bizarre but rather funny first episode you'll find yourself in a very entertaining and much strange world a very well drawn perfectly animated world that is br br i can't tell much of the story without spoiling it so i'll just say that it's a high school comedy and yet it's not i can't really say what it's about really br br seriously i'm a huge anime fan and i've got around 50 full series and i'm not kidding when i say that even though i haven't finished watching it is actually standing in a very high rank in my personal collection i fell in love at first sight with this one and i assure you that at the very least you won't be indifferent to its irresistible charm trust me i don't go around giving a 10 to every thing that i watch,1
506,i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you this movie was downright corny and cheezy but after a certain point i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action adventure the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde our fearless leader kennedy decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles dumb yet funny the kicker comes here though after one shot the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don t even see it its right in front of their eyes final rating for this move 1 10 out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy,0
507,sure the concept had already been done with alf and the thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990 when i learned about scorch i was actually very hopeful for something new as new tv in the 90's so far hadn't impressed me but at least star trek tng and the simpsons were still going br br what i got was a big disappointment the acting was awful but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing i can't blame them too much for what they had to work with there were a few humorous moments but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time in the 80's it would have fit right in br br still it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series so i gave it the benefit of the doubt the second episode wasn't as bad and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride the show would improve sadly my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired i never got to see it and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape,0
508,i just saw checking out at the philadelphia film festival what a terrific combination of a heartwarming storyline and a great cast director jeff hare has done an outstanding job of inviting the audience into the disjointed yet hilarious world of morris and family the family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy antics yet feel the real pain and concern they have for one another br br typically i am not a peter falk fan but he is morris and plays the role with great humor and humanity br br i hope that everyone gets to see this wonderful movie and enjoy it as i did br br hats off to the director cast and crew for a job well done,1
509,check out the first 20 minutes even though the suspense hasn't yet kicked in we get a pretty good look at super secret los just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii except for the tight security it looks unthreatening enough note how it's a tv repairman an obvious regular guy who takes us through security once through it's like any town usa nice homes quiet streets kids going to school and a family tv on the blink later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates the movie appears to be saying okay we're tough only because we have to be but basically we're still just folks br br now i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to government's dooms day research it's a clear effort at popular reassurance the one darker note is when tommy's mother clarke worries about her son's mental state he doesn't say when i grow up instead it's if i grow up that note of doubt not only reflects a los reality but also a national one that in 1952 had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h bomb note too how professionally fbi agents are portrayed a standard feature of mccarthy era fare when brute force is needed it's not they but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the early version i suppose of modern era rendition br br once the kidnapping occurs the suspense doesn't let up the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing the climactic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place but the view of northern new mexico is great then too the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law enforcement tool among an otherwise subdued cast nancy gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher ellen haskell never hollywood glamorous she was still a fine unsung actress and winning personality i also expect this was one of director hopper's more successful movie efforts and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time,1
510,what's there not to like br br i caught this again tonight and marvelled as to hugh capturing of the essence of philip larkin without resorting to tics and caricature br br there are many layers to the depiction of the complexity of the main character and hugh brings them to life his prudish mother his unresolved issues with his father and his inability to commit to one woman br br his poetry is interlaced throughout and some scenes are caught in his recounting of them to the wife of a friend whom he later propositions but quite casually almost innocently it is not difficult to see where his attraction lay for the many women who fell in love with him and knew about each other to boot and continued to see him br br cerebral fun loving jazz aficionado loyal friend it is always more than looks women moved beyond his baldness deafness and short sightedness and a beautifully nuanced performance by eileen atkins as his mum is an added bonus br br 9 out of 10,1
511,the italian job requires daylight hours and no experience is required this is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies the plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process it's car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by edward norton for norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as the score mark wahlberg and charlize theron deserve better scripts warning if you've seen the trailer then you have seen the movie if you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need the italian job,1
512,and now for another point of view i didn't like it i didn't finish it in fact i know that unforgiven is ranked by some as one of the greatest westerns ever made i know that it stars and was directed by clint eastwood one of the icons of american cinema i know that it won a bunch of oscars still i didn't like it i don't like westerns and that's clearly a matter of taste but i also don't admire eastwood's acting he is not and never has been a leading man he is no burt lancaster no paul newman no john wayne in this film alone he is dwarfed by richard harris and gene hackman they are both actors no eastwood is a tall guy with a reedy voice who usually plays tough guys here he plays a retired tough guy when i see him on screen i see a man at his acting then there's the anti western western plot it is too obviously intended to inject contemporary values a respect for the role of women blacks native americans and single parents a disrespect for violence and drinking the wholesomeness that comes with marriage including interracial marriage and small adorable children into a century in which those values weren't necessarily accepted at least in these ways by promoting those values the movie comes across as mannered if not preachy then there are the hoary movie stereotypes prostitutes with hearts of gold the kid who can't shoot straight the city slicker new to the wild west the sage brush shimmering on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in major chords finally there is the pacing of eastwood's direction i gave up after an hour eastwood was still riding north chatting with morgan freeman and the kid who couldn't shoot straight sixty minutes after the plot driven by the slashing of a prostitute was set in motion it was way too slow somebody had to find these elements uncompelling i am afraid it was me,0
513,i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie that was humorous however my expectations were let down this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg 13 movie this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this br br even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie beware of a truly stupid movie there's no humor in the movie just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia something that shouldn't even be joked about br br i would like to know what happened to pg 13 movies that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re rated,0
514,i just returned from viewing this academy award nominated doc and i was thoroughly touched and interested in exploring the works of this fellow i'd never heard of before of course i'm someone who's captivated with beautiful architecture so i realize others won't care br br we can only imagine if there had been a couple more visionaries in philadelphia back in the late 60's when kahn's plans were a possibility what a wonderful city center there would be if you wonder whether you'll see more about the bangladesh building at the beginning of the movie be patient for there it will provide the climax of the film at the end br br his son's personal discoveries in the process of making this film are quite interesting sometimes touching and even funny at times there is one of the most comical anti visionary rants ever captured on camera br br rounding out the good points of this doc is a touching musical score with some excellent expressive string music and expressiveness is a major point to be found in kahn's architecture the points made by other architects about the spiritual nature of matter and how kahn's buildings brought that out tie together the overall experience of this movie,1
515,this movie is awful just awful someone bought it for me as a christmas present because they knew i liked a good horror flick i don't think they understood the good part all i can say is next year this person is getting slipper socks from me avoid this movie it makes you bitter peace br br,0
516,what ever happened to shows with united parental figures the parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative they let her get away with murder they can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children and instead they do nothing yeah great plan just ignore their behavior because they're cute this show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the divide and conquer technique is the best way to get their parents to cave the oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations but there are no consequences for their actions yeah great television all right,0
517,the opening credits are pure poetry and i have watched it several times it had a corny 20's adventure feel to it of course kathy is gorgeous but that voice did she realize this was a talkie one word voice coach great film for chronic insomnia along with a bottle of scotch,0
518,saw this film at the in london where it was showing as part of the bfi's john huston season i wasn't really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away in fact the rest of the film continued to give little away no real plot no action no suspense very little drama and except for a short section at the very end no scenery br br the result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film i don't fully understand why but i think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect the acting script and most important of all the casting were all spot on and i can't remember walking away from a cinema feeling so good but i still can't work out why i just know that i will be getting the dvd this is one of those films that will i am sure be just as good on the small screen as the cinema experience provided that you can find somewhere quiet to watch it and i will be watching it again soon i will be also interested to find out what my family and friends think of it i'm sure that it will not be everybody's choice but i am convinced that a large number will agree with my view br br 9 out of 10,1
519,still haven't read a single dan brown book but i watched all his movies adaptations i won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same actually this one is a thriller a race against time filled with puzzles br br the plot is very twisted imaginative and the cast is excellent i never been a great fan of hanks but he delivers well i noticed his jeans shirt the one spilled with blood because i search for one like this in vain the italian is a brilliant newcomer for me but i really applauded ewan macgregor portrayal his inner faith and calm is really impressive br br i really like the debate between science and religion the action taking place in the vatican it felt like vacation at last i am not sure it helps to add new converts into with all the gold and man presence displayed any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers,1
520,director and fx man john carl doesn't have to do much in order to terrify me the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart br br his lamentable straight to video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop twenty years later and his dvds occupy the same space it seems that the more things change the more they stay the same you can rely on old to serve up dreck whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie making technology br br in this contemptible offering a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of stone aka the forty evil claim jumping cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid 1800s before his death cursed anyone who should find his gold and it's not long before the pick axe wielding killer is back bumping off the hapless treasure seekers br br with its dreadful script unimpressive make up effects and scooby doo style villain 'the curse of the forty is par for the course for only genre stalwarts keren black richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful although i'll forgive alexandra ford who is a complete hottie br br even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on and a lot of the deaths occur off screen which is probably not such a bad thing since the on screen deaths are pathetic br br 'the curse of the forty is another in a long list of duds for john carl,0

522,ok lets start with the best the building although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting other than that its not worth it br br as far as the bad its done by wwe films wtf is that supposed to make you want to see it if anything stay away horrible horrible idea for them to make movies and allow gregory dark to direct it bad choice the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining br br i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is untalented actors a disappointing vague storyline apparently many of the actors are from that show all saints its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show other than that the bus driver which you never even see just him closing the door has had more action that just about everyone together at least he handles stunts for some decent films br br i like to see scary movies i really do but this one blew so much the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through very annoying the child behind me was more during the previews of other horror films br br this is not a film to see even less if you have to pay for it,0
523,this movie came very close to being a good flick the direction needs to be a bit smoother to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible in particular the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough is he trying to kill himself is he trying to escape his life does not seem to be that bad so it makes it more difficult to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much also it is not very clear how much in love he has fallen with jennifer jason l if the movie was reworked with some more attention to these details it would have been great on the other hand for an indy flick it's pretty good maybe if you have a couple of drinks to dull the logical thinking it would be more fun br br,0
524,an untidy man known as bill lives in a small dreary flat with a poster of marilyn monroe on the wall and his typewriter for company only the man can't think of anything to write he wanders around the streets following people just to see where they go maybe this will give him some inspiration to write he begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag he follows him for a few days while in a cafe the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of bill and inquires why bill is following him the well dressed man says his name is cobb cobb then surprisingly informs bill that he is a burglar and even starts to take bill with him into houses to steal things although cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal he says he likes to let people know he has been there and interrupted the things they take for granted he puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers for example br br the film is told in flashbacks at times too the director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature memento bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit on the advice of cobb he meets a blonde lady in a club who used to date the owner a bald man who is very dangerous she says we see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the blonde lady's flat these are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion,1
525,blindingly stupid guff from the formerly talented john hughes who'll soon be making a film with the sperm from 'look who's talking' if his stars get any younger he recycles the 'home alone' formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby makes his way around chicago while inept kidnappers joe mantegna joe pantoliano and brian haley try to catch him along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick if mantegna and pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble but the laziness of the movie is most glaring in the scenes where crowds of people fail to notice a baby crawling around on the pavement utter nonsense,0
526,that this film flopped at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves today is a great pity yet somehow rather appropriate the commercial suicide the monkees committed by making this film is mirrored by the metaphorical suicide they commit on screen to destroy so brutally their carefully constructed image as a wholesome american alternative to the beatles is courageous to the point of rashness as is the admission of being no more than pawns in the entertainment industry trapped in the movie literally in their own artificiality the television series was not that conventional but head is utterly plotless although in the end there is actually some kind of circular logic to it all unrestrained by a genuine storyline the surreal sequence of events is by turns hilarious and rather disturbing the greatest irony is that the monkees effectively signed their death warrant as a commercial force at a time when they were reaching their artistic peak their exploration into psychedelia reached its zenith with the soundtrack to head all the songs are memorably woven into the film which is one of the landmarks albums of the the monkees began to disintegrate after the box office failure of this movie but head serves as a noble legacy,1
527,although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies even they are above this movie it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement fear or dread unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks and what a killer he is a cheap skull mask and a black hood i liked him better when he was fighting he man this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen i mean it's skeletor and he's on a horse this is supposed to be some scary supernatural creature how are we supposed to take this seriously all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse which he can barely stay on interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods thinking they can shoot a ghost occasionally skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone revealing how corny the effects really are i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment where's dolph lundgren when you need him,0
528,this movie had a very unique effect on me it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks it is disguised as a film in the likes of memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks the whole idea is  i don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind a very weak one btw with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and what how what why why is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add forgot about cooking it i guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of why was this happening you have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts lie solving riddle rhymes start to have an abnormal effect on people acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store yeah they're all real though s o b's the menacing atmosphere with the oh so clever riddles enter the 60's series of batman and robin with guest appearance of the riddle and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their just horrible horrible br br i'm usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it,0
529,this film is a masterpiece to put it simply especially the double exposure made by the cameraman julius it is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later viktor the director also plays the main character david holm on the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost there is a new soul collector to be appointed every year br br the scene in which the alcoholic david holm rises up from his dead body like the soul is leaving his earthly body in the where the fight took place is a real award for a eye also when the present soul collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene david holm recognizes this soul collector as a from earlier life it is now his turn to take over just like scrooge in dickens story a christmas tale david is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him br br the film is about the danger of abusing drugs in this case alcohol it is based upon a book by nobel prize winner selma viktor filmed a few more of her books but this is the one with the best outcome maybe because this book is the most filmic of them br br,1
530,captivating tale of backstabbing behind the curtains the movie follows the plight of david letterman and jay leno as they struggle for the elusive tonight show spot letterman led by his desire for the coveted time slot and leno led by his agent and little devil on the shoulder helen br br kathy bates is excellent in this movie alienating herself from such top dogs as bob wright warren littlefield and howard stringer towards the end of the film you are so entranced with how she handles every situation from guest bookings to delayed taping that you find yourself wanting more br br john michael higgins letterman plays his part to the tee at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real letterman br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiations,1
531,his has to surely be one of the worst gay themed films of all time who told any of the so called actors that they can act bad sound bad script gestures so overboard that they defy reality a nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes br br after seeing other low budget films similarly made i was prepared for something innovative but not plain pathetic br br parents and friends really should not encourage anyone to make such tripe br br and the dvd no menu access its worse than a vhs tape once you start you have to watch the whole thing through luckily the fast forward button works with this film and dvd nothing else does,0
532,this movie had great production values good lighting costumes set cinematography and acting but someone somewhere took the script and replaced all the dialogue with grade school level barely literate writing i felt my iq dropping points any time any character spoke br br did they do this on purpose was this just an accident of brain dead studio executives at this point we don't know br br all i know is this movie was one great mistake from beginning to end we don't even get to see how the squad became cops so instead of any character development we get what feels like a bad tv movie leftover from the 60's or whenever br br find the screenwriters beat them with a sock full of quarters everyone else nice work but read your scripts next time br br 3 10,0
533,i was first introduced to john waters films by seeing female trouble on ifc i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it then i picked up the pink flamingos dvd in the john waters boxed set the movie is about babs johnson the filthiest person alive who lives in a trailer in maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother and her deranged son crackers in the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens drag queens people eating feces torture and all other sorts of random humiliation the film has a soundtrack from 60's rock and roll artists the only problem is that some parts of the film seem to drag on and can get a little boring i found female trouble a little more fun rated nc 17 for explicit sex violence and disturbing images enjoy,1
534,diane lane is beautiful and sexy and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving br br set in let's say a suburb of newark the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and and a film of the while the sun sinks slowly in the west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world,0
535,i watched the unrated version of this movie and as a person who has studied the life and crimes of speck closely i must say this movie is a flawed but ambitious take on the real story while capturing the true horror of speck and the murders this film makes the following factual errors 1 speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the movie in fact he was mainly an alcoholic and pill who rarely took drugs via syringe 2 the asian nurse who survived massacre did not squirm her way down stairs and under the couch in the living room as depicted in the movie this would have been impossible in real life she hid under a bed while speck methodically eliminated his 8 victims 3 the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them not true in reality speck was at first calm and gentle reassuring the women he wasn't going to hurt them this is how he was able to tie each of them up 4 the real richard speck was not the deep thinker the movie depicts him to be fbi profiler robert interviewed speck in the 80's and said that speck not only did'nt know why he committed the murders but that he wasn't interested in learning why nor could he shed any light on why speck was known to be of below average intelligence and not the philosopher king who narrates this movie if the story wasn't so tragic and horrifying the voice over would be laughable all in all doug cole's performance is adequately menacing and cold blooded even though i don't think the real speck was so forward in his violence no doubt he was a very violent person when under the influence but he was also known after all for being a fairly slick con man who was able to put people at ease before victimizing them beverly ann performance as the surviving nurse is the finest in the film she is a very good actress if you are at all squeamish do not see this film it's very graphic and disturbing,0
536,this is a great western story with outstanding veteran actors who made this film great entertainment to view and enjoy glenn ford john parrish midway '76 tries to play low key after having experienced battles in the war and plays the peace maker role for the time being john parrish decides the town is entirely too rough and tough and goes to visit barbara stanwyck martha crime of passion 57 who is the wife of edward g robinson lee the red house '47 lee offers john parrish fifteen thousand dollars for his ranch and john turns down the offer lee decides to have his son brian keith cole the wind the lion '75 change his mind in more ways than one there are romantic scenes between may wynn caroline vail the caine mutiny '54 and john parrish and some hot encounters with dianne foster judith three hours to kill '54 who hates her father lee if you like edward g robinson and glenn ford films this is a film you will want to view and enjoy from beginning to end,1
537,as social satire idiocracy is just as good as office space but with a wider scope to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point i think there are certainly fart jokes etc but they're not really intended to be funny to the audience they exist to define the state of culture in the world of 2500 ad visited by joe as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives and which should serve as a warning my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at smart people and average joes like the protagonists note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular but on the culture of idiocy in general i don't know what to say about the made for conspiracy theory behavior of fox in releasing this film but if it's not playing in your local theater demand it we all need to see this film if not for the social commentary at least for the fart jokes,1
538,honestly how hard can it be to make a good remake obviously pretty hard i was soooo excited to see this because i loved the original and my friends go and see it and tell me it really sucks well i finally see it and i was sooo disapointed ok the shower scene was more realistic that's why i gave it a 3 otherwise it did suck vince vaughn does a terrible job playing norman he's just too dense or something i don't know it was just terrible don't see it,0
539,just saw this film the other day at the santa fe film festival i was delighted by its honesty and humor it was the most thought provoking movie i've seen in a very long time i just can't get it off of my mind for some reason it may not be for everyone because it makes you think i don't know if people like to think in movies so much anymore which is a shame the actors who play the are quite a find i couldn't imagine playing these complicated people with such frankness though i thought a couple of the supporting characters were not as good as the i can totally forgive it because this is an important movie in my opinion i didn't expect to like it so much but as i've thought about it for a few days it's proving to be a very relevant piece of entertainment,1
540,rarely have i seen a work of literature translated so badly to the screen the hysterical cast of b movie and sitcom extras simply make the characters seem like bad jewish stereotypes the worst of all is melissa gilbert who you hate from scene one and never develop any sympathy for performances like this should be noted and used against actors who wish to work again all in all a seedy low budget made for tv film of the sort that gives made for tv films a bad name,0
541,it sounded so promising in the rental store the premise sounded great and i couldnt wait to get home and watch it it was apalling the diologue is dreadful the action is extremely badly scripted and the plot takes a nosedive from the beginning gutenberg puts in a pathetic performance sean bean tries his best but with a script this bad there wasnt much he could do br br this isnt even worth watching even if you can get it for free borrow it off a friend for instance dont as you will regret it and waste 90 of your life br br 0 10,0
542,this is a snuff movie i'm shocked it is even considered to be in the imdb library and bill julia and all other professional actors involved should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick i thought i was going to view a somewhat classic horror film with a creative end that writers like to invent that usually make no sense when writing a horror film but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand this ending was not creative it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie i am shocked it was edited to this ending and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of june 2009 it should not be shown in a theater it is harmful to innocent minds on many levels watch the movie the ending and you will understand this statement plus included in the plot is a sweet little girl not yet 9 her character says she is not in the snuff ending but she is an integral part of the movie why do directors feel they need to shock with a sick flick in order to get recognition the director is in the wrong line of work if she thinks this is an art film,0
543,don't see this movie it's repulsive the start is indeed very good but in the middle everything falls and i really regret spending 80 about 11 dollars on the ticket peter dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest awful picture the only bright spot is the splendid work of robert lena nyman and br br hope you take my advise the picture is rubbish,0
544,i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br i don't remember much of the plot and i think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential the beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and i'm using that term loosly scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings,0
545,my caddy limo was destroyed well i had one just like it drove the hoi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years br br that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you lordy what a bomb as in rpg go boom i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick br br robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with unfortunately rutger hauer played his part like a red nosed circus clown if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming br br the dialog was written by 10 yr old's for 8 yrs old's surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets oh well i am a movie fanatic ergo you must take the bad to get to the good,0
546,k one day my father picked up a movie with a cover got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before ok so it started interesting start cool robots and disgusting gore eek on a strange planet actually it was pluto wasn't it blablabla i could tell the whole story but i rather not point wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name and seriously don't ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover err tape it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci fi movies its disgusting i mean it was so bad i just started laughing i swear it to be serious i cant describe the stupidity it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can't even write a descent critique its that bad argh and i wana prepare you for something cough cough mechanical cough cough sorry just had to say it its so funny think of it as a or a parody of sorts for sci fi movies its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging what the hell was this director thinking,0
547,br br first of all i reviewed this documentary because i had an interest in the subject it portrayed the la punks br br i listened that music and i loved that music and i read a lot of the small that were made in the early 80's and that were not so easily achieved in finland br br so if you don't like this kind of music why you write here about it i like this kind of music it speaks my soul thus i know punks from all over europe americas so why do you who find this music repugnant care to comment at all br br,1
548,being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new i am discovering their hallowed horror films as i find them on dvd i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in lee was a great dracula a vibrant vampire if that possible in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening the young people talk like cartoon characters even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clichés i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd they were all pretty terrible characters anyway i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline munro but she leaves the story too early lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film it's d o a,0
549,okay now this movie is a piece of work it's full of stupid jesus and that would render most human to question whether or not they should be movies at all big names like roddy piper and david carradine draw you in but take it from me this movie sucks the story is incomprehensible and lacking completley in intellegence the sets and costumes come of as a cross five and a bondage flick i'm sure theres porn with better,0

551,this movie is worse than heaven's gate or plan 9 from outer space don't know why it got even one oscar it should have gotten a million raspberries just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place the hospital was a first rate financial failure but i'm certain the elite classes of left wing gutter mouthed intellectuals that the american public was far too to appreciate biting social commentary when they saw it and on and on george c scott in one of most artless and embarrassing roles along with aging sex symbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly blasé manner as they push along a silly plot poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it there's also some sacrilegious junk dialog tossed about hither and yon laced with plenty of cussing as well it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest never want to see another minute of this awful movie again,0
552,i guess if you like watching dudes get pumped up to outrageous sizes this is right up your alley otherwise it's an exercise in ego i don't need to do either anyhoo it's of historic interest i guess to see how these muscle positive and brain negative chumps got that way before after and in between steroids but otherwise this isn't going to influence many guys and as for women well i'm not one so i can't say,0

554,this is a known fact mr seagal cannot smile he can act he can kick butt there are faint smiles no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie we see an over weight mr seagal as dr wesley maclaren who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter made an appearance as his office assistant story okay so wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter holly they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote problem there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while the cia are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill daughter holly so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather who is a native indian together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time and to shorten the moment neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus hmm one weak fight scene terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master,0
555,what the hell was this i'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or the number 23 everywhere he goes but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get we just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid life crisis and his journey to redemption kinda like an old man flick if you ask me i probably should have just rented wild hogs it wouldn't have made a difference i mean who are we kidding they should have made someone else the killer of that girl by juxtaposing sparrow with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along how would that have shaken our heads shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction,0
556,bathebo you big dope br br this is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible oooooo the toilet is flushing by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet 1992 doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like 1952 i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the drivel br br scary old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made,0

558,considering the appalling track record of mick since going out on his own i had rather low expectations of crackerjack even the promotional posters for the movie had me nervous in fact if it wasn't for the fact that i'd received free tickets to the preview i would have resisted the pressure from the missus who thinks mick's a hunk there's a worry to pay money for it br br the first few minutes of the movie had me worried it starts with one of tired get angry at insignificant things routines but that was given a neat touch which at least made it a little refreshing the rest of the script was pretty good and very light hearted even the typical mick and judith lucy humour was delivered well and whilst i never had to pick myself up from the aisles it generated a lot more chuckles that i was expecting and it was br br there's nothing new in the plot pretty predictable but it moved along quickly between one liners and other jokes i never felt it harboured on any element too long or too short mick must have worked hard on polishing his script there were a one or two late show in jokes and one or two jokes that only would get but certainly there's plenty of generic stuff in there for a wider audience br br something that i found disappointing was the relative of john clarke he just didn't seem to work as the bad guy but that doesn't detract from the movie too much br br over all i enjoyed this comedy and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie i left the cinema with a decent sized grin a pretty hard thing for an australian comedy to do in my books 7 5 10 br br,1

560,there needs to be a 0 10 option for bilge like this br br it was painful to watch but strangely compelling all the same compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much i kept thinking it must get better it got worse and worse br br how on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk i'll never know the most surprising thing of all though is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie yes the acting was good but the movie was very very very bad worst movie ever,0
561,this representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch i know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking but this 15 minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot the great train robbery 1903 which i also commented on is much more creative and exciting to watch br br we see little long haired jack trade a cow 2 men in a cow suit for a of beans from a merchant and later a grows from where his mom throws them in the yard i guess poor jack attained the wrong kind jack dreams of a goose actually it seems to be a chicken and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven br br there is no effort made to be creative in this film the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the goose chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films the leaf covered rope comes trailing down from above and coils neatly on the giants forehead br br watch something else,0
562,if you love the book as i do stop watching the video after jean and joe meet in australia up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great 10 out of 10 to that point and i've enjoyed it many times after that the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book i e how jean creates a town like alice springs in the early part the major change is to make a 40 something bachelor instead of a seventy year old widower this rather skews this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious such as in the book he to joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in australia but in the video he gives joe no clue about whereabouts or intentions the last hour of the 5 hour video and mangles the last third of the book i see no reason why they threw in a fight between joe and jean it is quite out of character and seems to be just an aussie dig at pommies for telling them what to do then they bring on for the wedding instead of some three years later and have him read the toast very strange especially in the context of the relationship between jean and noel as cast in the video the whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters these abominations take up time in the last hour which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how jean recreates as a place where she and joe can both be happy,1
563,i've loved this movie since i was a little kid i remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me i loved it and i still do i think it's very funny and original there are also some very catchy tunes in this movie lou is also a surprisingly good singer the actors that portray prince arthur and princess eloise are okay too but abbott and costello are the best former heavyweight boxing sensation buddy baer also brother of former heavyweight champion max baer is good in this movie as the cop and the giant he's a better actor than boxer he had a natural talent the beginning of this movie is hilarious how lou costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with buddy baer the slapstick in the house is good too i especially like the comedy in the castle my favorite parts are the part were lou is climbing the and they're all singing as a farewell jack is singing back to them that he'll return lou costello is a very good at singing my other favorite part is the part when jack is fighting with the giant i like when jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the giant an omelet they keep exploding abbott and costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time this is only one of their great movies that i will love and cherish the reviews for this movie aren't very good and i can't understand why this is a very good abbott and costello movie i also love how lou costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when bud hits him he starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around very good movie,1
564,while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth br br the case is the use of the soundtrack music a mix of gustav and andrew lloyd webber that plays constantly and loudly and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult how ecstatic how tortured it is to be an artist and then it really counts the story the details at the end br br this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book this is not writing this is barbara cartland precisely the same critique can be made of this film a deceptive mawkish vanity project,0

566,i saw the film at the brooklyn international film festival world premiere br br a haunting intimate portrait of loneliness and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker br br the acting of the two leads jessica richard brundage is excellent and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged br br reminded me in theme of the works of atom egoyan exotica and raymond carver where i'm calling from br br the soundtrack jo crooked fingers is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself br br highly recommend the film and the soundtrack,1
567,this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched at the age of 12 i was up late and ran across the movie it was on the usa channel gilbert up all night i will never forget at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues some sexual you know 12 is a very rough and weird age it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl and being a young lady this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me i now have a daughter that is 12 have been searching for a couple years for this movie if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age,1
568,nothing is sacred just ask ernie these days everybody has a video camera and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self importance 25 years ago when the first star wars was made it was a different world filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare then god gave us hardware wars it was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact does that take away from the experience heck no that's what makes it so great it was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie from fluke waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber i did that when i was young to the wookie monster to auggie ben nah just a little headache remark this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films rent it buy it borrow it from a friend and may the farce be with you always,1
569,it is very hard to come up with new information about jfk jr and this fine movie had very little of it but it was a joy to watch the casting was very good and the script while somewhat like a documentary was also good my only complaint was that it wasn't long enough perhaps a two part movie could have told us more about his pre george days and his relationships with his mother sister and other relatives some of the material in the book american son by richard blow would have enhanced the movie a lot should be applauded for producing such an entertaining movie,1
570,it's a time machine all right it runs in real time for 96 minutes but it felt like 96 years the first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous massive amounts of dead time throughout what happened when will something happen who cares apparently the film was made on a tight budget i note for your edification the following the nothing like saving a little money by reusing the sets and costumes from lord of the rings part i hey the scary dude in charge of controlling the the scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of gene simmons of the band kiss old costumes little known fact freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails br br save your money save your time pass on this one,0
571,this is a good film this is very funny yet after this film there were no good ernest films,1
572,sorry to disagree with you but i found the series to be quite engaging so much so that i invested in the system and my own copies of the games this is mind you almost ten years after the initial release of 1 the graphics were ground breaking for their time the first graphics games for home systems the music and characters are all memorable and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment true the second game was better than the first and the third was perhaps lacking the of the second installment but all three offered different play and i enjoy them to this day by the way i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever and tvs were black and white,0
573,this is another of hollywood's anti communist polemics of the golden 1950s stalwart american gene barry lovely englishwoman valerie french and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given containing fantastic and fantastically vague power what will the earthlings do with such power toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific then one scientist alone with the ultimate power in the universe comes up with his own theory and uses it his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling br br here's the spoiler for this dog the capsules inside the have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only confirmed enemies of freedom that's right don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom just do it hurray no commies silly female and you threw yours into the sea ha ha kiss me baby,0
574,this is a phenomenal movie truly one of the best movies i have ever watched i am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me but this movie had all the right combinations for stirring the passion of the actors without the overacting the aching for all the characters involved the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce all make this a must see movie despite the fact that it is 1970s this is definitely not an old movie but a classic vintage movie i hope you engage with it as i did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the hardest decisions to make will always be the most painful but once they are made the pain will subside but only gradually this movie certainly demonstrates that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily weak relationships and that leaving certainly is not synonymous with lost lack of love the of this movie certainly emanates from a place deep within someone's heart and mind,1
575,as an avid gone with the wind fan i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters luckily the film on its own was a wonderful piece when the book scarlett came out i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together while the book lacks any true quality it remains a good story and as long as i was able to separate it from the original was and still is enjoyable however i consider the six hours i spent watching the scarlett miniseries to be some of the worst spent hours of my life any of the original character traits so well formed in margaret mitchell's book this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape mistrust murder and relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well formed in both the original novel and film and even carried through in the second book and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character in the novel scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family after coming to an arrangement with rhett she agrees to leave and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah eventually she accompanies her cousin a passionate leader of the brotherhood to ireland to further explore her family's roots that go deep and is eventually named the o'hara the head of the family while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners and instantly becomes a sought after guest at many of their parties she having been scorned by rhett time and time again eventually agrees to marry luke the earl of fenton until rhett comes along in a clichéd night on white horse type of a rescue the scarlett miniseries fails even to do this justice raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed br br i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision,0
576,watchers is a fun movie if it's not taken too seriously the novel written by dean r koontz is obviously a lot better but the movie itself is entertaining in it's own way the film has a lot of changes for the novel watchers the one difference is the main character travis in the book he was an adult and an retired delta force soldier while in the film he's a teenager watchers has it's good points the film does have some gory scenes in parts i'm a fan of micheal ironside and it was cool to see him in this film he always does a great performance in all his films the costume looks kind of cheesy but the camera never really shows the creature fully until near the end of the film the dog einstien was impressive since it was well trained br br the film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a lab a dog and a monster both experiments are linked telepathically since the two animals are part of a military project were the dog would infiltrate an enemy base then the creature would attack and eliminate them the dog finds a teenager named travis who takes him home and discovers that he's intelligent and so he names the dog einstein meanwhile the is roaming around killing people and gouging out their eyes two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this incident gets out of hand soon travis learns that his not safe as the is drawn to the dog and will stop at nothing to kill him and anyone in it's way so travis and his mom go to rescue his girlfriend who's being held at the hospital by the two agents they then hideout in the woods while the government agents and the are not far behind br br watchers is not a great adaptation of dean r koontz novel but it is a 80's horror flick some fans of the book may not want to watch this since it's not faithful to the book but fans of cheesy 80's horror movies may want to check this out,1
577,parts the horror is a horror all right there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's there's the really bad acting from dick sargent to peter graves and then there's the clones themselves their days mostly consist of running jumping cycling and wrestling with each other when they're not doing that they learn about america not the band america or the song by neil diamond but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society but they're given some strange drug then they have all their bodily fluids drained general ripper was right and they are placed in the freezer and await thanksgiving or christmas when they will be out and roasted at about 450 degrees or so oops that's not what happens but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown mario of super mario brothers fame makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who bickers with dick sargent,0
578,i saw this movie on it's opening night and enjoyed it i probably would have enjoyed it more if i hadn't been sitting by my father my father saw the original unfortunately i have not seen it yet and kept talking through the whole thing he kept saying that the movie sucked and that it was stupid the thing is he didn't understand that the creators were slightly making fun of the horror genre with the film in every horror movie there is always a certain character depicted if they weren't in the movie well you might not really like it too much the trademark characters are br br the lead character carly elisha cuthbert the lead character's boyfriend wade jared the lead character's sibling soon to be reformed jerk nick chad michael murray the annoying sluttish character paige paris hilton characters who are just around to look pretty dalton jon abrahams blake robert ri'chard br br with those characters it makes it slightly predictable who will die and who will live obviously you know who will with what i just typed the movie may be predictable in fact i had a pretty good idea who would die just by watching the trailer but it was still enjoyable it may seem stupid why is there a sugar mill in the middle of a deserted camp site that wasn't there in the beginning at times but it is very easy to watch the comedy and gore were the perfect amount for weak stomached movie goers it does get gory don't get me wrong less than final destination 2 but it works very well so in conclusion this movie wasn't as hot as the fire the set went up in but the temperature could still burn the wax,1
579,can't liberals like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004 the ridiculous lame swipes at walmart non union workers george w bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional gwb accent that character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen as the credits roll the sour grapes continue as special thanks are given to ken lay and other ceos from enron and let me clue you in to something if you put all your money into one company's stock you're an idiot we don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that what a waste of jim carrey's talent from the trailer i expected a completely different movie what i got was a 90 minute commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future keep them stupid and keep them dependent on government no wonder hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once although i shouldn't be surprised since jane fonda was cast in the original,0
580,i jumped for joy to learn this show ended this show's characters were extremely irritating none of them had one singing redeeming quality damon wayans is probably the most one campbell is campbell she's just as annoying as she was in martin br br the kids are all very annoying as well the oldest is an idiot the oldest girl is a stuck up brat and the youngest is frustrating to listen to br br i guess i did like the intelligent little boy but that's about it br br it did the world a favor by ending br br let's pray that a wayan never stars in another show ever,0
581,i was 13 yrs of age when i saw this greatly underappreciated film at the adams theatre in newark nj i purchased the program and later bought the soundtrack still have both i am now 55 yrs and have not seen it since possibly once on network tv in 1960's one of the greatest casts ever assembled great score and production please let another generation see this great film it was my introduction to opera and aided with my understanding of tolerance please family of or release this classic soon,1
582,i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like and viva la bam a lot more i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam or jack ass should see it i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more,0
583,widely known as don't look in the basement this is pure 70s horror b movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre's version of one flew over the cuckoo's nest though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour of it's runtime i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable man child and a loony nymph after their head doctor is murdered by a patient a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under staffed facility who becomes immersed in the resident's different ticks and outbursts things gradually become stranger however when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual you never really know or care where the movie is going 'cause it still entertains up until it's completely whacked out ending several of the twists felt a little too forced and i could have used a tad more blood but i really dug this much too under rated blend of humor and horror check it out,1
584,hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly br br when the movie opens up you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp whoa shock that scene the dialouge were all great and then the movie went downhill br br while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have this movie sucked it was too slow too predictable and not moving enough robert downey jr is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors br br don't waste your money even the sex scenes were boring,0
585,so it has come to this in the top rated comment on this flick somebody says is an honorable man really this is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie he takes a short break to rob a bank honorable how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable wait there's more the person also says we can tell he's constantly thinking how can we do that well do you know that joke how can you tell when a ceo politician lawyer is lying his her lips move well lips never move so i guess that means he is thinking br br of course this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization supposedly stresses that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts not borrow money from the yakuza what they want it back kill them the cops find out kill yourself and your wife br br really honorable,0
586,shameless waste of my time as a viewer this is one of the worst films i've seen in ages please do not rent it as you will regret doing so guaranteed i wonder how kathleen turner ended up in this she is a legitimate actress and people would perhaps be attracted to this film because of her but it really is better to act as if this title was never made it should not have come into existence,0
587,just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i did'nt have anything else to do went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments and what do i find every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky i would'nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck ass movie i thought that i could br br the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson think i got the name right as he were overacting especially when he was high the rest was'nt as bad as him but no one was good neither i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much except it sucked though no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey maybe they were idiots in real life to and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters i hate when they do that in movies same thing in the doors even though i like that movie more don't have any energy left to write more it sucked don't buy or watch it,0
588,no i'm not kidding with this one he was a guest reviewer for entertainment weekly and gave this movie positive marks and who can blame him this is a charming upbeat and rather funny disney movie who doesn't love kittens the music in wants to be a cat is jamming it makes me want to snap my fingers or something only years later when cats don't dance came out have i seen a movie that was that musically fun what aristocats lacks in animation and story it makes up for in charm plus everything moves at a relaxed pace and even the villain isn't all that scary it's perfect for the younger set while not being so sappy that adults can't like it if snoop was here i'm sure he would say the same thing yeah dig those crazy cats man,1
589,saw this movie when it came out and then a couple more times years later i'm watching it now 20 years later and it's still a very good story does it wreak of lifetime movie network yes but alas lifetime was not even in existence back then so it needed to air br br the cast was excellent the story was a little schmaltzy two women become close friends and unbeknownst to either one friend is having an affair with he other friends husband she's invited over to the house for a dinner party which is how she discovers that her lover is the husband of her best friend she is horrified and tries to break off the affair shortly afterwards he is tragically killed in a car accident which is for both women of course the wife finds out by accident about this affair and wants holly out of her life now but their friendship is able to prevail because they need each other br br i thought it was a very good story a great cast and i really enjoyed it,1
590,this movie had such a good premise to start with suspense slashers a secret society and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie br br but it contained so many dumb clichés from the worst of the old american slasher horror movies now i love slasher horror movies but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from american cinema for example the old i hear noises in the basement and i'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work so i'll go down to investigate cliché br br three examples of these clichés just really irked me to no end br br 1 when potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone very publicly in essence she is saying i found you out come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret and then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her severed finger in a towel br br 2 even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2 3 more times by herself at night to investigate br br 3 her roommate gets killed she gets chased by the killer whom she knows doesn't report him to the university or the police then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents then she returns to school apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let be and not try to kill her even though she knows his secret she was of course wrong br br for someone who was supposed to be so smart she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany she acted like the cliché bimbo in a horror movie br br these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me wish the ending would come even sooner halfway through the movie i stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table too,0
591,this is a romantic comedy so it's really a fairy tale but an unconventional one cinderella rather than living in the ashes lives in an castle in the suburbs with a good looking husband who's no prince she does find her prince but he's not that handsome instead of a castle at least initially she gets a tiny walk up in manhattan br br stockwell and ruehl lead a cast of fully realized if a little over the top characters br br demme reaches the highest level of movie making in my mind he creates a world i want to move into a manhattan neighborhood and street life teeming with life and community br br i wish imdb linked to reviewers' other comments i'd like to know what other movies the people who panned this one hate i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to live at least for an hour or so,1
592,i saw this on mystery science theater 3000 and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but i've seen silents that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldn't even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life br br update i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2 it's not the worst movie i've ever seen anymore,0
593,with old razor blades can i help it if i'm not cousin basil i think the piano's out of tune ginger grey this is your little laughs throughout the entire 20 minute short as the boys spoof gold diggers and opera singers they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap wonder how many times they rehearsed the scene with the phone booth adding christine mcintyre and emil sitka 2 frequent collaborators to the mix makes it even better only vernon dent is missing the stooges did some great individual scenes but this was their best overall,1
594,a quick paced and entertaining noir set in vienna just after w w 11 donald is a refugee who can't find legal work because he does not have any papers no papers means no work permit which means no way to get a passport he survives by driving a friend's cab at night if he gets caught it means three months in jail one night he picks up a fare at a big hotel and drives the man to an airline office takes the man's luggage in and returns to the car there he finds his customer has acquired an unneeded hole in the back of his head what to do call the police without a work permit they will put the grab on him real quick no he needs time to think this out he drives to a secluded spot empties the man's pockets and hides the body he now has an american passport and plenty of cash he drops by an underworld contact to have the passport photo changed now he just needs to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's plane ticket his ticket to freedom needless to say that would be too simple waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress joan is on the run from her rather nasty husband francis lederer lederer is of course the swine who had bumped off the man in cab calls the police since she believes has robbed her lover shows his new passport and manages to talk his way out of the mess breaks down when hubby lederer shows up at the police station lederer convinces the police has suffered a mental breakdown and she is released to him she escapes again finds and the two decide to flee the country together lederer again puts in an appearance and must decide if helping is worth his freedom this film is much better than i'm making it sound is best known as the low life cop killer in 1950's between midnight and dawn the film was produced by actor turhan bey,1
595,the bottom line is if you come looking for a sci fi thriller horror film the matrix is what you'll like if like me you long for the rare true science fiction film involving characters with depth and provocative thought about where science will take us then you need to see,1
596,although i was hoping that i'd like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film there were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what i'd call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested for me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well i also thought that the low budget suited this movie for i don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim all things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but i'm still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie,1
597,heather graham married carl luke wilson and about five hundred and some days later carl is very depressed and leaves her expecting to clean the fog' in their lives faces her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life and decides to look for carl in texas she is very supported by her brother jay casey affleck who meets her in the border of mexico there meets the confused carl and realizes that she can not change his decision while jay knows carmen patricia and starts dating her and in the end life goes on' this movie is very unpredictable having a very different story i believe it is an independent production in some parts it is a little slow and boring but there are certain dialogs that makes this movie worthwhile i liked it and my vote is seven br br title brazil até o rebels until the end' br br,1
598,leslie nielsen hits rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy that is the worst mainstream film that i have ever seen there is nothing to like about this film as it is essentially a one joke film and the joke isn't all that funny how many times are we supposed to laugh at an almost blind man making a fool out of himself that's not funny that's just pitiful nielsen seriously needs to start refusing some of these pathetic scripts and stanley tong needs to stick to making jackie chan films because it doesn't get much worse than this,0
599,the acting is awkward and creepy and not in a good way at all the writing the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors is horrible nothing makes sense and every close up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long making it seem like a mexican soap opera everything about the writing is unrealistic and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script am i the only one who sees this to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air,0
600,queen of the damned is one of the best vampire movies i had ever seen the movie had suspense action and gore the combination of the fierce demanding attitude of the queen and the rock mood of our star very well acted by stuart townsend makes a wonderfully done movie that only this combination can create i'm always the one to give advice to my friends and family members on which movies are worthy of renting and when they ask me if queen of the damned is worthy i tell them it's worthy of buying this movie is most for sure a must have in all horror movie lovers' homes,1
601,as a long island independent film maker myself and having have had two theatrical releases under my producing directing belt i had always been told of how much i could learn by viewing a fred carpenter production so i was lucky enough to have his eddie monroe as my initiation to his superb budgeting production casting settings and masterful directing talents my heart went out to it's characters it's story and was totally won over by the trick switch ending that brought the film's plot to fruition were marvelously chosen and human emotions in it's characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that mr carpenter utilized throughout to his and his film's benefit,1
602,i love the mockumentary format that chris guest and crew have developed over the years i actually like this and waiting for guffman better than spinal tap which was the first of the group and made by rob reiner but starred guest and several other of his mockumentary regulars this humor is not for everyone it's rather subtle and not too physical so some people may not relate however as a dog lover and a dog show fan i loved this movie there are so many funny lines in it my daughter and i quote them to each other often i find it amazing that these people can ad lib so much funny material for each movie what a fun bunch they must be i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side,1
603,if i compare two films with sacha cohen borat and ali g then ali g is immeasurably better i'ts no master piece but it's a film at least borat is complete garbage and i do not understand how it rated better then ali g br br i cannot put my finger on it there something wrong with the ali g script half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old not by an adult scriptwriter and a number of jokes including mr cohen's lower body are quite tasteless br br but the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny such as how ali g becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public sadly true in today's western society people get careers for doing stupid things in public also advice about immigrant policy and some others br br ali g overall remains a sympathetic character even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age but it's ok to watch it's quite funny br br but never ever watch borat it's awful and makes every intelligent sick,0
604,i was forced to watch last year in year 10 australian history looking around the class room both classes all 40 students were nearly asleep all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them i refuse to believe that because i am only 16 that my opinion doesn't count having studied world war two i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements the acting was poor the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful please do not watch this film it is bias and very racists to the,0
605,yes it's a so bad it's funny classic with a budget running into the tens of dollars some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments not even a nanosecond camera work was at the elementary school level one still shot outside a house was obviously hand held and crazily blood looked like watered down cherry someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the human bones and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal mart could provide br br did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms it would be career suicide to have this on your resume do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his instead,0
606,beautifully constructed tells the story of narcotics usage and commerce from multiple points of view from a policeman view from a politician view from an addict view from a view and from a farmer's view in a carefully storyline one gets the impression on how everything is inter related from beautiful on location shots in the poppy fields in pakistan to downtown to the entry points airports of frankfurt and london to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place one sees the massive dimension of narcotics consumption,1
607,i was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by joshua leonard before its premiere at the 2005 sundance festival in twelve brief but exquisite minutes leonard takes us on a life changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society the film embodies elegant direction moving performances and a heart rending story kelli garner and lucas haas radiate as the two lovers and in his first venture into dramatic narrative leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future i feel this short should be expanded into a feature film it's difficult to describe talent but as this debut film demonstrates you know it when you see it,1
608,i'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is but i couldn't find it it's a really long barely credible hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set br br it doesn't move anywhere the characters are just totally bizarre the underlying plot equally so it's lost on me definitely a walk out movie br br the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax and the fact that all irritation aside at the banal personalities they're acted quite reasonably but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the up for a moment,0
609,best years of our lives perfectly captures the era of my youth and the feelings of that time the cast was uniformly wonderful this was possibly dana andrews best role of his career and he should also have been nominated for an academy award there are so many wonderful scenes in this movie it is almost impossible to list them all the cinematography is among the best of any film this movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's a must see movie for any true movie fan some critics have said this movie has aged i disagree the theme of human desires is timeless and the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us this is just a great movie one that can be watched over and over again,1
610,this story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner something which sets it apart from most films with this plot mr lam jacky cheung has a relationship with choy lam who was also so good in koma in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation he is married for 20 years to ching the great anita in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us and it appears to be a loving relationship when ching offers to care for hers and mr lam's former teacher choy and mr lam have the opportunity to be together what makes the film so good is director ann pacing it takes a while to uncover the secrets of the and it all makes sense the movie is very dramatic and touching you don't feel any repulsion about the teacher student situation something that elevates this film above many with the same plot it is slow moving but stay with it also revel in ms wonderful unglamorous but beautiful performance she was and is someone truly special and in this film you fall in love with her one last time it is worth the time to witness and just be there with her,1
611,i would say to the foreign people who have seen this movie and who did not understand it that it is normal because it was based on massive plays on words a person not knowing about the french cultural funny references in this film could not follow all the subtleties the movie has been a huge success in france and all the actors are well renowned here,1
612,this movie is by far one of the worst b movies i have ever seen there are no plot twists at all though the acting is decent the storyline is terrible there are also many mistakes in the movie and it was bothersome to watch for any of you who like horror movies slasher movies or even b movies i don't recommend this to anyone at all most of the movie is focused on pointless killing in ways that aren't even worth discussing this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of jeepers creepers which too wasn't that great of a movie for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home watching poorly made movies this one takes the cake,0
613,and so it started with a send up of horror films then we had scary movie a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre the illustrious send up however now we have scary movie scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4 date movie meet the spartans not another team movie plus many more genuinely funny movies marked with br br and super hero movie it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send ups funny using the rip offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly but not many producers seem to know how to do that scary movie 1 did it well the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise but it was redeemed by scary movie 4 not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well and to its credit i am sick of teen movies however this movie plays like a bad version of all of these it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe violating the image of stephen hawking and then when people begin to get bored and the producers knew when this would be we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit to conclude spoofs should be about making a homage like mock up of an original movie with an original storyline not random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film br br i shudder at the thought of sci fi movie and get my seppuku knife ready,0
614,the only reason i watched this movie a second time was to learn the name of the second banana girl playing opposite katie her name is marisa never heard of her before she is lovely captivating with an animated face and cute bod she is highly watchable she's got real more than a passing vibe of grace kelly with youthful exuberance i think she is irish in gene pool my favorite female dna so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american the movie is unremarkable katie is classic beauty in the flesh but marisa is the one you follow with your eyes in 1999 when this movie was made she was around 25 years old in her prime this reminds me of another silly worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it it was career opportunites with the first time i saw jennifer or grease ii the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer,0
615,would you like to know why french and italians love hate each others would you like to have a glimpse of history that drives our lifetime so go to watch film in original language of course and you can look at a wonderful monica bellucci who finally speaks her native language from città di just at the border with tuscany and the rest of the characters speaking lovely sabrina and all the others daniel auteuil definitely in his shoes with napoleon a lot of fun a real fresco of the elba island landscape and a picture about the political reasons to kill or leave alive a tyrant good for all times,1
616,honestly this show warms my heart i watch it everyday on fox family and now that the new season has started i'm even more hooked than before the characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real i would recommend this show for any woman or mother and daughter the are super fast talking witty girls that will truly inspire you and the show is hysterical at times and never too too serious but serious enough for it to be completely addicting it's an hour long which is a major plus because you can't ever get enough gilmore even in one hour emily and richard gilmore are kicks parents grandparents they're you're average rich parents emily president of the dar and richard a well known lawyer and yale alumni st rory is following in the footsteps of her grandparents and this could not make them any happier of course mother is so very proud of her but her whole life has worked on ultimately defying her parents and rory going to yale did not help her on that journey but believe me every episode she does get closer,1
617,so pathetic its not even funny from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv the story line was terrible not to mention the acting it was horrid very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as the lady sticks a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just hands over the keys i'm like get real the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting which was in itself pretty lame all i could ask myself when watching this movie was when is it gonna go off,0
618,this entry doesn't contain a spoiler it doesn't have to the movie is as predictable as the sunrise the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen this was so in the first two predator movies though less prevalent requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore you know people are going to die well duh it is a movie but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die and where they are going to die before it happens the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table suspense is a bomb not going off under the table what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when if you really really want to watch this movie wait until it comes out on video and then rent it but by no means would i ever buy it,0
619,i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident my dog woke me up i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well as a kid i had enjoyed it but now as another poster commented several of the reels were out of order and while it was disorienting at first and bizarre it seemed to fit the production what was just awful became surreal and amusing musical numbers for what i think was the big fundraiser show you're in show business i'm in show business most of the kids are in show business let's put on a show come out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show and then fade without applause to totally unrelated straight scenes the leading man's girlfriend shows up spits out lines and lines of dialogue then disappears i was half awake and loved every insane minute of it,0
620,north and south is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos it is for the most part excellent for what it is although i personally prefer the less soap opera like elements of the story and the overall sense of history br br james read and patrick swayze deliver excellent performances especially read whose george hazard serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story the series also contains top notch work from kirstie alley wendy hal holbrook lewis smith genie francis georg stanford brown and others the costumes filming sets and music are all first rate as well br br don't take it as a history lesson but take it for what it is a well made sweeping epic from a bygone era book 2 which followed a year later is also excellent but i would advise viewers to skip book 3 which came out 8 years after book 2 and was not nearly as good as the first two parts books 1 and 2 are classics though even with their elements and they are well worth watching,1
621,great british director christopher nolan momento insomnia directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people this proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering the two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution jeremy plays the writer and alex haw the like minded friend both are great performances this low budget movie was shot total guerrilla style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction an impressive debut by one of todays best directors good stuff,1
622,i think that it's great how chiller picked up this series and showing it for this generation film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now monsters is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining it takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have it's own horror series this particular series was not as horrifying as the friday the 13th the series nor as adult oriented as the freddy's nightmares it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a fright at the same time i am happy the chiller channel shows it in their line up i am just about caught up on the episodes i missed when i was growing up,1
623,a 'wes craven movie from 1995 directed by joe clayton and starring lance henriksen a group of scientists save a dying man they find by their desert stranded government outpost by injecting him with their experimental virus of course one of their colleagues goes overboard and the virus transforms the man into a near unstoppable monster with them trapped inside lance henriksen plays the morally offended researcher who leaves the project before all this but returns after receiving a call for help to save the man pre unstoppable death machine mutation br br deciding to combine two trips in one he brings his family along with him they're going on vacation afterwards and proceeds to give them entry to the top secret government facility thus putting them right in the middle of the chaos within in case you can't tell this one relies on the viewer to work with it a little and put aside some petty see major and blatant details br br overall though watch able with mild bits of enjoyment note the outpost is commonly known under the title 'mind ripper',0
624,i've seen director's cut version and can be nothing but content excellent acting esp cole hauser i was sad about little space for claudia black though subtle visual effects and photography in overall believable plot considering the genre without a lot of logical holes really non predictable twists build up characters these are the greatest assets of the movie combined with style some may consider this movie a b grade effort but i would disagree with that the whole thing really is very original and stylish br br and even though i'm not a fan of vin diesel this tough guy role of riddick suited him well can't wait for chronicles of riddick it's really cool this flick's gonna have a sequel br br 9 10 if you ask me,1
625,i kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere when it ambiguously got there i was very disappointed i'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence but maybe i won't maybe i'll just imply something will happen the writers lacked any imagination this is not even a b movie it's a made for tv b movie,0
626,i could never imagine i would start loving movies like this after seeing yimou zhang's 'hero' i decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar the second yimou zhang's movie i watched was 'no one less' after which i realized what kind of cinema i'm now in no wonder why i got 'keep immediately it is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema i pay my respect to the director br br this movie shows that it's not the amount of money makes film good it's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this the story is very simple a typical extract of a typical daily life moreover shown in a very simple way the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie i give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other yimou zhang's films,1
627,i picked this dvd up for 3 99 at rogers video in order to get enough points to get a better movie for free i never actually was planning on watching this but it started poking at my curiosity and i finally decided to pop in it the dvd player the effects in this movie are horrible and cheap some of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a swear happy 12 year old boy the acting is really cheesy in some parts and the action scenes are completely laughable you'll burst out laughing at some parts which was a positive for me because it kept me mildly entertained the plot is some girl has a curse on her which causes her to vomit snakes so some shaman has to get her to los angeles there are also two girls trying to smuggle drugs there and a few other people that are unimportant to the plot not that there really is a plot at all don't expect anything from this movie and don't listen to the cover there are not 100 passengers and 3 000 vipers there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes br br as for the dvd there is a trailer which is almost as laughable as the film a blooper reel which is just one shot over and over of one actor trying to say train and the deleted scenes are really pointless if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie they must be pretty bad there is also a really bad making of featurette which doesn't really show much at all except that the people involved with this movie were kind of idiots i can't recommend it unless you want a really bad movie that you can laugh at with friends i give it 2 kitty cats out of 5,0
628,for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job we have to support the emerging industry especially coming from up north it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs it's a feel good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents the film has just opened i do hope it does well people should support this little film i think this ' person is very bitter about something and getting too shame i say well done to all those a drink on me i look forward to you next venture,1
629,i thought this movie was brilliant it was so funny and so true too a great idea for a movie five groups of friends on their way to i've got to say that matt newton as mason was probably my favourite character i wish i could give this movie more than a 10 rating,1
630,i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick the shonky production values and low rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci fi channel style knock offs br br the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever br br the cinematography is dull flat and completely uninspired like so many of these kind of films it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film br br the film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion describing all people of a certain skin colour as muslims most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone at the same time the muslim terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype br br presumably the far far superior had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably,0
631,sam o'steen the film editor on the superlative suspense flick rosemary's baby from 1968 here directs a quickie tv made sequel one in which rosemary woodhouse patty duke astin in for mia farrow is shunted off early and inexplicably presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satan's son on earth most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar winning role as minnie with ray milland well cast as her husband roman but she isn't given much to do and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway this script is strictly low rent goods and must have shamed original author ira levin who went on to write his own sequel fairly dim and pallid with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever,0
632,a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable the giant zeus network president does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the 'battle of the tough guys' but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced br br normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role however this film didn't ask the to make very much of a stretch it simply asked hogan to play himself which he failed at miserably 'tiny' lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus but even his work left the film lacking something namely acting br br watch this movie if you so desire with a grain of salt and a sense of humor otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in,0
633,after reading the terrible reviews of this movie including comments said to be quoted from colin i almost didn't bother to add this film to my firth film collection however being the firth fan which i am intrigue got the better of me br br to my surprise i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it had suspense drama and intrigue and v sexy colin scene's the plot kept me guessing right until the end credits and i felt that once one got past jennifer rubens opening scene's that the actress played her role convincingly colin was as brilliant as ever and its great to see him play a character from the 'dark side' a 'chill went down my and after watching this i can't wait to see recent film to be out on dvd br br ok perhaps it a film that was 'in your face' so to speak and one couldn't 'go to sleep on the plot' especially towards the end as there was a lot going on but that was what i liked about it the acting was subtle thankfully not overdone like many suspense thrillers this made the film all the more chilling to watch one just couldn't second guess what character ross talbert or for that matter jennifer rubens character jamie harris was going to do next and there were quite a few surprises in store i sat on the edge of my seat throughout with a cushion handy br br personally i am very glad that i watched and i shall certainly rewind and view again i think that any firth fan would benefit from watching this film if they didn't like the plot then just watch colin,1
634,an absolute classic of 80's scare flix this one isn't like any other as it pits pint size wild eyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown ups in town bud from just one of the guys 80's gold again plays one of the killer kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls jake blues tries to purchase in the blues brothers there is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason the violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots the demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extra planetary means bear little resemblance to the droid ish children of the damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults julie brown not downtown julie brown the other one shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom this movie is a rarity that i cannot believe i missed growing up in the 80's this would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if i had seen it where is the sequel the ending begs for this movie is just incredible seek it out at all costs,1
635,the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months the plot of the story was uninteresting the movie ended when he became khan i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that the jokes where really poor the narrator himself could have told a bit more about mongolian history traditions etc my co viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end,0
636,topless touch football a wet t shirt contest a raid this house has it all except a plot and good actors the film consists of several pranks and catfights between the h o t s girls and the bitchy pi house the dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant over the past couple of months it's been popping up all over cable so do yourself a favor and watch out for it h o t s is so bad it's good,1
637,i'm a christian and i have watched pretty of christian movies but this one is too bad they try to make this good but it's too hard for them i think br br you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places you can almost think that the in this film was the only ones left behind i think there will be a lot more of them br br the quality is poor and the acting could have been better too the story is not so very bad but could've been better the only plus i give is to the story in this film but totally i can't rate it more than 3 10 watch left behind instead,0
638,this movie reminds me of great movies that temporarily wake me up with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked our election process is unclothed and dismal my awareness is heightened and i want to see the world change after a short while i am lulled back to my little complacency and bubble life in the best sense of film this work will ferment into an edible stew for me and like in network i want to be convicted to as mad as hell and i'm not going to take this anymore ' but to whom my vigorous youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to concerned parent with quiet convictions or rather beliefs man of the year reveals how much i yearn for honest and sometimes humorous takes on our current political situation line i did inhale because i thought 'what the hell it's lit it's in my hand i'll inhale it ' was refreshing or would've been when clinton was president why can't politicians be honest and set that tone for debates we people must realize how much veneer is being put forth as real i am sick of this election process already anyone else let take off the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to task not re elect when they continue with evasion and non representation of citizenry this movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians that spew rhetoric great film,1
639,carrot top in a full length movie enough said only reason this doesn't get a one is through my personal voting system of only one 1 and one 10 and this is no extreme ops horrible god awful there are some movies that are so bad they are unintentionally funny then there are movies that make you physically unwell and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide burn all copies of the movie shoot anyone who had non creative input on this movie torture anyone with any creative input and as for the star there are only so many things that can be said online but he should be begging for the final ten seconds of existence with a severed head by the time the work is done,0
640,i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen it's one of the main reasons why i stick to dvd's or videos i saw the clearing on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream he's not dead yet you moron br br the clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mr redford legal eagles havana indecent proposal up close and personal sneakers last castle and spy game if robert redford told me to invest in something i'd go the other way br br but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun he's holding it on you for most of the movie you turn the tables on him and start strangling him whatever you do keep strangling him until he's dead don't just strangle him for ten seconds stay with it ten minutes at least but bob stops too soon walks away and forgets about mr kidnapper until he gets up finds the gun and holds it on our hero again at this point i wanted mr kidnapper to shoot robert redford more than a few times and i wanted to shoot him as well,0
641,channel zapping one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning it tells the sad story of an adopted child adam whose mother left him after birth the movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from adam's past i will not reveal more but it is a very in depth movie and will intrigue you for sure this was one of jimmy best roles in my opinion,1
642,not as bad as some people say this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of thunderball written by kevin co producer in thunderball well the cast is very very interesting maria brandauer is a great bond villain kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the original bond girls plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox who looks really refreshing in the m role in fact the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses sean connery does it once more confident and charming except that he looks a little bit too old but alright he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role the locations are also typical bahamas france etc the only thing that really fails is the music score the song never say never again is o k but the theme song is just missing all in one a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like moonraker only if there was another story thunderball was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake,0
643,lovely candace bergen as the widow are kidnapped and held for ransom by the sheik played by one dashing sean connery the incident comes during 1904 as theodore roosevelt runs for election to the presidency in his own right needing a good example to show off the muscular foreign policy of the united states brian keith as roosevelt issues a stunning declaration to the sultan of morocco alive or dead br br but in this adaptation of that incident the famous declaration is the only true thing about this story the in question was in reality one ion who was a greek immigrant and dilettante playboy in fact gave up his american citizenship years ago and was back as a greek national never mind that though his predicament was serviceable enough at the time br br the damsel in distress makes better screen material though so it's a widow woman and her two kids that are in harm's way here of course as presented here the incident is also used by some of our european powers to get their foothold into morocco the intrigues get far beyond one demand for ransom br br the wind and the lion is hardly history but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch brian keith also fits my conception of theodore roosevelt and the scenes in the roosevelt white house do ring true to all the stories told john huston plays the ever patient secretary of state john hay who roosevelt had inherited from his predecessor william mckinley br br but kids don't use this film to skip reading a history assignment on the theodore roosevelt era,1
644,in the late sixties director sergio corbucci made four spaghetti westerns in a row the classics the mercenary the great silence the specialists and companeros three of these all except the specialists are constantly turning up on ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are rated until recently all i had seen was a very poor quality compilation with some english some italian a fuzzy picture and it was nearly incomprehensible now having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles still in two languages however i can safely include the specialists in that group of four classics johnny halliday is very good as the charismatic hud a notorious hand with the gun returning to to investigate the death of his brother who was lynched by the townspeople for losing their savings it involves a voluptuous beauty who owns the bank a mexican bandit leader el diablo who was once friends with hud an honest sheriff who dreams of better days and a small band of hippies well it was the late sixties and hippies were everywhere even apparently in our westerns it's not a desert western shot in the alps somewhere and is lovely to look at there is a bit more nudity than i expect in a western but that's not a bad thing sylvie is lovely as sheba who may be niece or dead brother's girlfriend that's never made clear this film deserves to be seen and once again we plea for a nice dvd with all the trimmings i think the specialists would be as well known as any of other westerns and that's high praise indeed,1
645,now the sci fi channel original company has made some pretty crappy films house of the dead 2 all souls day etc but when you leave the job entirely to horror master actor writer and now director bruce campbell you get one of the best damn made for tv independent horror films ever made i normally hate these movies in my previous review house of the dead 2 i could not believe how horrible the film was but somehow i took a liking for this film a very good liking for this film the violence is good and so is the black comedy in the film and i recommend you get it a true bruce campbell masterpiece well since there is only a few more lines left i can say whatever i want about this movie,1
646,alright so this episode makes fun of al gore i'm sure it pisses a few liberals off the thing is south park makes fun of everybody much like the simpsons did if you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously with that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best al gores portrayal is hilarious scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing it is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites i'll won't comment too much further on the plot because i don't want to give anything away,1
647,i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that you will be thinking man the conan movies were pretty cool this one is totally boring and sucks the story who cares it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film arnold doesn't look like he belongs in this one why he agreed to play the role is beyond me well probably for the money i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine lame this movie is just plain and simply terrible,0
648,it's dreadful rubbish i liked 'how do you want me' 'father ted' 'green wing' and bill bailey's standup act but i file this with 'hippies' and of the apes' the re imagining under 'great pedigree went badly wrong' my guess is that it appeals to the same people who like and i' it's overwritten but to little end a ish air pervades it and bernard black is simply a less camp withnail and i thought it was self indulgent even before dylan moran became the writer but the set up such comic potential that for the first 2 i didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit chortle worthy br br the things they are saying doing should be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or i can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny what i am trying to say is that the situations remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane gentle self consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom br br life is too short avoid,0
649,we stumbled across this show one sunday morning at 6 30 a m while flipping through all of the cable channels and this turned out to be best show on it is absolutely adorable we need shows like this for children and adults as i'm certainly way beyond my childhood years as one of the other commentaries pointed out this show benefits from the simplicity of the characters and story lines the puppets are fantastically cute the backgrounds are colorful and even though they are created out of cardboard foam paint and pure imagination they remind us of our own childhoods when we could spend the day at our own grandma's house exploring the world around us for those who never were lucky to have a grandma as nice as nana this show is for you you'll make up for lost time this show is a true inspiration and filled with cleverness and humor and just outright fun for children and adults alike in other words don't overlook this show just because you're over the age of three spend a half hour with mona nana mr and russell they'll be friends you look forward to seeing,1
650,this is one of those movies i watched and wondered why did i watch it what did i find so interesting about it being a truck driver myself i didn't find it very realistic no i've never used a nor have i ever seen nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar rv either br br same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question until the end of the movie and well he still really didn't and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut' when the prostitute gets 200 00 well 150 00 after his cut yeah br br i still laugh at the lot lizard comment made them's lot lizards they'll screw anything with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as woman or something equally as weird meaning we're better then them as we may still be prostitutes but we get paid better br br other then that it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home she's 18 remember and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing dead end job at least she had a roof over her head and a job she turned five tricks on the road i wonder if the 750 00 she made was worth it i'd guess not,0
651,saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids a bit predictable the book was better gave more plot details ore about the environment and how the kids uncovered the conspiracy i think warped humor comes across better in the book than the movie but there were lots of funny moments in the movie as well it is probably a bit too slow paced for kids under 6 yrs of age loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher and those baby owls were adorable i wonder how they managed to film them the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing am i imagining it or did the author carl make a brief appearance,1
652,burt reynolds stars as an undercover cop who is after a crime boss rachel ward as the high price call girl he falls for burt does well in this role and i think he would've done well in more roles like this br br rachel ward is beautiful and sexy in her part good pacing and story but something is missing in the equation on a scale of one to ten 7,1
653,both disney and bill paxton did a fine job in conveying a story that is based in fact you do not have to like the game of golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds it could have been based on any sport or simply on any other situation which involves competition though this one just happens to be related to golf the only problem i have with the story is that i would have liked to see a bit deeper into each of the main characters esp mr mr francis is a typical young man of his times turn of the century america where class lines are well delineated and woe be it to anyone who deigns to try to rise above his class standing i did a bit of historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered to my satisfaction although the circumstances are a bit different than those portrayed in the film i came away with a feeling of content i thoroughly enjoyed this movie i believe you will too,1
654,i first saw this when i was a teen in my last year of junior high i was riveted to it i loved the special effects the fantastic places and the trial aspect and flashback method of telling the story br br several years later i read the book and while it was interesting and i could definitely see what swift was trying to say i think that while it's not as perfect as the book for social commentary as a story the movie is better it makes more sense to have it be one long adventure than having gulliver return after each voyage and making a profit by selling the tiny sheep or whatever br br it's much more arresting when everyone thinks he's crazy and the sheep do make a cameo anyway as a side note when i saw laputa i was stunned it looks very much like the kingdom of zeal from the trigger video game 1995 that also made me like this mini series even more br br i saw it again about 4 years ago and realized that i still enjoyed it just as much really high quality stuff and began an excellent run of sweeps mini series for nbc who followed it up with the solid merlin and interesting alice in wonderland,1
655,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br what is the purpose of this movie a bunch of americans enters nazi occupied france and starts slaughtering germans you see them their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats while making jokes of course br br some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre for a parody it is neither witty nor funny the contents is zero it is exceptionally brutal and disgusting underneath lies a subtle political message because it is again the good guys killing bad nazis the whole plot is unthinkable if you turn it around could you imagine a storyline where nazis while making jokes kill everybody in the warsaw ghetto with flamethrowers probably not but this movie is exactly about that with the exception that is satisfies the weird moral expectations of a certain audience slaughtering people is so cool when done by the right people br br this movie only works because of the hidden nazi ideology underneath it does not regard the enemy as people and if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun i am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me br br another mystery is how such violence can fascinate the american crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out but if a naked body is pornography this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst br br inglorious basterds is a pointless boring and tasteless waste of time and money,0
656,relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match 5th is gorgeous but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film there are many aspects to this film but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty its spontaneous nature absence of logic for love and adoration i am also an ardent fan of bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful try him in the servant however note i multiple viewings,1
657,like a twisty country road tough luck takes the viewer for a ride there is nothing wrong with plot curves as long as believability doesn't fly out the window unfortunately in the end the film does challenge an audience's belief tolerance nevertheless it is easy to forgive this fault due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere do not expect to like any of the characters armand norman and play shady con artists not exactly the type of person easily admired the double crosses come fast and furious and the final cross is a bit of a stretch recommended merk,1
658,this movie is retarded a cheap movie that tries to be a stoner movie because the characters are looking for pot but none of them are smokers just a bunch of garbage thomas hayden church should not direct anymore especially this movie which is a waste of film people who liked this movie gave good comments but from all the people on here some are just retarded and don't watch movies so they think that any bad movie is good the actors suck and the movie sucks balls br br i think that many people are going to be upset because this movie tries to make itself look like the ultimate weed movie when it is just the worst movie about weed that i have ever seen i hope that people will stop the director from directing crap like this even weed cannot make this movie funny or entertaining,0
659,not every line in a comedy is funny this movie takes a serious subject the of voters and holds it up to the light while telling jokes about it it's the movie the daily show would have made if they wanted to turn it into a movie i found robin williams to be much funnier in this movie than he was in rv and while my wife and i share a few opposing political views we were both doubled over in laughter for several parts of this movie the script writers here could give fox news some lessons in fair and balanced lewis black was okay for his part but never really seemed to be able to bring out his particular brand of comedy for his role christopher walken was also good playing his fairly common subdued supporting role pushing a story along,1
660,this film was both entertaining and thought provoking i'd recommend it to everyone who wants to be moved and challenged great acting directing and it is canadian to boot it is a film that families can enjoy and serious movie lovers the locations in ontario evoked such a sense of nostalgia for the era with so much garbage and superficial hype selling these days it is great to see that someone could back an independent flick for any family that has risen to overcome a challenge or an obstacle be it financial or illness this film strikes a resounding chord it approaches the idea of the afterlife in a contemporary way without cheaply capitalizing on all the and supernatural themes that have become staples in hollywood and the tv networks,1
661,possible spoilers br br i've read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on dahmer himself the film called dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself br br i did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor but i might be wrong about that br br what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway that is ok but what i then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened it's not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out what wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was dahmers sexual obsession with the dead again i don't mind they didn't show it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow br br conclusion i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did i think that 1 5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all this movie was just a cutout excuse the pun of dahmers life and personality and does not give you any to good' insight into his life or personality br br 4 10,0
662,has all the ingredients of a good joel schumacher film intelligent youthful characters stunning cinematography a gripping story and excellent performances it's escapist fun but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unnerving br br schumacher has a knack for spotting talented young actors and all of the main five here have gone on to greater things see the cast list their believable performances help to raise this movie well above average kiefer sutherland shines in his egotistical med student role br br the cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain which is what i love about schumacher his use of light and location create images that stick a disturbing nightmarish atmosphere is created which unsettles you while you watch the film and haunts you when you go to bed reminded me of the lost boys br br this is a film that takes an awesome premise curious students want to find out what's after death and successfully follows it through into a scary gripping tale of redemption one of schumacher's best highly recommended,1
663,as was mentioned by others could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former wayne's world star mike myers play a serious role the story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters if there was any good scenic shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green of the emerald isle that are often shown in irish films if there was any cultural to admire the irish personality it would be worth seeing however this could have almost been shot in england too bad for myers but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of guiness,0
664,end of days starts off pretty well arnie plays a down and out cop a very similar character to riggs in lethal weapon and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment br br sadly it fails to deliver arnie is as good as we we have come to expect but as for gabriel byrne i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this cast as the devil this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever br br this movie gets a little too daft for me and the end sequence aside from being very weak is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties br br quite simply not good enough 4 10 watch it if you have too but don't expect too much cause it won't deliver,0
665,i have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie br br i recently had to undergo knee surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this br br christ was it a mistake i have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict this is just a pile of s t pasted to a d v d disc and sold as a horror movie br br i have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap they are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement 0 10 and thats generous,0
666,wow it's even better than i expected the best animated movie ever and it feels so good to hear roger carel doing the voice of again i surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of but i suggest that you go to see the french version cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast did you know that roger carel has played for nearly forty years i think he did a marvelous job and the song from céline dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits the music is good the drawings are good the actors are wonderful in a word a masterpiece go to see it you will not regret this,1
667,i have seen tons of trash in every language about every topic and of every trend of film making from every period every director and any kind of budget available that said i really have to declare br br this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seen br br it's painfully bad it's pompous it's grim it's incomprehensible it's annoying it's a really bad mess it is a piece of you know what br br and what's more important it lacks a point and even if it had one the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing br br it's just weird for the sake of being weird br br i actually felt sick watching this trash the theater where i saw it lincoln center in new york was full when it started by the end of it half of the audience had walked out there was a q a programmed at the end but nobody stayed with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door myself included br br save 2 hours of your life it's probably one of the worst ever done br br if there is a movie theater in hell this movie will be playing 24 7 for eternity,0
668,hitting the ground running the film begins with three murders in a row no plot no characters no motivation the second murder happens off screen and that victim's severed head is actually used to quite efficiently bludgeon the third victim to death this is a high point but the are obviously smart enough to lead with strength soon they're covering up botched dialogue scenes with detective voice over and shooting endless snappy repartee in ugly wide shot by now this betacam production's horror atmosphere is rapidly giving way to an insurance infomercial vibe with the monumental and rather endearing plainness of the leads skewing things further in that direction cop investigates meat cleaver guy slaughters repeat climaxing early with a memorable severed finger in the salad gag only how the hell did the fingers get in the salad and wasn't the blood cult's purpose to collect the appendages they severed when the gore stops making sense you know you're in trouble and without spoiling the big nonsensical twist ending just take my word for it the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode tube smashing impulse the basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get on with your life,0
669,well of course the critics hated it this isn't a movie that's going for the big time critical acclaim but the fact is that it's really very good br br sure if you don't like that chris farley brand of physical comedy or the exceedingly dry wit of david spade you're not going to like it but for the rest of us the movie has many hilarious and for that matter quotable sequences and the plot isn't half as dumb as that of black sheep the parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well not what you'd expect from a movie of this ilk and the acting is really pretty good br br tommy boy is without question chris best movie i give it an a and suggest you give it a view,1
670,maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv movie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency there is some talent among the cast but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas don't get much of a chance to showcase their talent the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter but will is stuck once again playing another dumb character though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his boy meets world role the background for this movie is washington d c and the white house but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty the disney channel presents a lot of original tv movies and most of them are better than this,0
671,worst movie i have ever seen 90 minutes of excruciating film making all the ingredients to make this movie a true work of crap bad acting bad directing bad storytelling bad makeup bad dialogue bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions taken by the characters it also threw in a terrible naked shot of a dumb blond and a breast shot of a stupid asian girl and both attempts were just scary since these girls are ugly some good horror movies came out of the 80s but this could never be considered one of them kevin tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in storytelling he introduced characters at the end of the movie an old man and old woman i would vote for it below a 1 out of 10 but the voting system doesn't work that way apparently right from the title sequence i knew it would suck and i would return my dvd but best buy doesn't refund dvds or products as they call it or so my receipt says i have the dunwich horror and that was truly god awful but i still feel that night of the demons an obvious evil dead rip off was far worse than dunwich horror this is just like the howling how in the hell could sequels get milked out of this anorexic cow save your money and get the texas chainsaw massacre just don't get any of its sequels though or the evil dead or dawn of the dead night of the demons is a very very very bad investment every second of it was just maddening excruciating pain for the audience because the whole movie all around was horrible do yourself a favor don't see it you'll be saving some brain cells,0
672,simply put paul bettany and jennifer connelly were remarkable the movie is less about the raw science of darwin's beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife emma and daughter annie br br toby jones gives a wonderful turn as thomas the great defender of darwin's beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with bettany and connelly br br but it is those two who carry the movie their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops transcendence as darwin grapples with his demons the scene where darwin relates the ending of the story of jenny the orangutan to his dying daughter annie is utterly gripping the world premiere audience at the tiff was spellbound bettany's performance will be recognized as one of the year's best in short order equally magnificent is connelly's work playing the religious wife of a man who in huxley's words killed god br br the film moves slowly through the entire spectrum of darwin's grief relishing every detail of bettany and connelly's acting br br brilliant,1
673,this is a bottom of the barrel type of b film from one of the poverty row studios monogram in the mid '40s the kind that filled out a double bill br br only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder he played phil in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen aged roles he's no mickey rooney br br the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of cliché ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals wanda mckay is the girl who is discovered by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who's afraid of his own shadow br br mercifully it's over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round up of all the suspects terribly overacted the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon as tex the cowboy but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance br br there are several songs but all of them are forgettable as are the lame jokes and dialog,0
674,while the romance in this film is an important aspect it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern indian all of the major characters were well fleshed out and had their own inner life i recommend this strongly,1
675,this is the movie that finally pushed me over the line into registering with imdb so that i could vote for and comment on it i've only recently come to appreciate well produced war movies and this is one of the most thoughtful i've seen br br stunning is the word that comes to mind when i think of this viewing experience my husband and i watched this film last night for the first time it is gently moving yet exciting at the same time not a contradiction this story in the hands of hollywood could have become just another smarmy action packed top gun time waster br br the two lead actors playing frantisek and karel played off of each other marvelously well and is a very pretty boy without seeming to exaggerate or exploit that fact in terms of acting ability and appearance my husband said tongue in cheek well he's no tom cruise i replied thank god if you appreciate beautiful and understated acting see this one,1
676,joan fontaine is swept off her feet by the suave cary grant after their marriage she realizes that her husband is very irresponsible and owes a major gambling debt it appears that grant tries to scheme his best friend nigel bruce out of part of his life savings bruce ends up murdered and fontaine suspects that her husband will try to kill her for the insurance money this drama drags on to an abrupt and flat finale,0
677,this is a great comedy highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot but also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other based on the hit itv comedy this is very politically incorrect and its all the better for it comedy after all is to entertain the movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot however the cast are as great as usual jack and rudolph walker make one hell of a team playing off each other in a kind of way it's been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd the fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments means that i can recommend this movie just like i would of back in the 1970's,1
678,i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles the fact is that there are no volcanoes in los angeles this movie should not be filmed in los angeles it should be filmed in honolulu hawaii hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in hawaii's state capital this movie should be filmed in hawaii because this is the real idea and not in los angeles there are earthquakes in los angeles but there are no volcanoes to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense,0
679,so many great actors so little worth watching but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special i don't hold it against anyone on screen though flawed the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town a slightly different world to a coastal such as myself i also loved the matter of factness naturalness of what occurs in the book in the movie characters are given a nobility of personality that seemed so stilted the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional but as with so much of joel schumacher's work genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection so preachy stilted and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right,0
680,i'd love to see some tie in between the fury and the x men series sort of the way the second outer series would tie in particular stories and plot lines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended i'd also like know if some more information anecdotal or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship and or collaboration between clive barker and david cronenberg i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david cronenberg appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally it's been 17 years since the film was released and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to fruition or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel,1
681,i like many folks believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced maybe the best and realizing that most sequels in this case a prequel are certain to disappoint my expectations were low comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting poor casting and frankly a lousy script br br lonesome dove created western heroes of captains and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones prior to living in lonesome dove we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their years br br if i had only seen comanche moon i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent cowardly idiots in lonesome dove call and supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him in comanche moon a shot to call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle there wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull a funny scene but out of character for br br where was wit and charm clara's love for a drunken unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible and maggie's love for call a dispassionate and sullen loner defies logic br br the cinematography was excellent superior to the original credit goes not only to hd technology but the cinematographer the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights but sadly that's not saying much,0
682,purgatory flats shown on cable recently is a small movie that packs a lot harris done directs with style the screen play by mr done and diane fine makes a good thriller br br if you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading br br the film is the story about a young l a doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten bad choice what thomas reed finds in purgatory flats is hell in the desert right after landing a job as a bar tender thomas meets a pretty young woman sunny who clearly is someone to stay away from the young doctor is called to help as sunny's boyfriend randy is gunned down by a drug dealer br br we get to know randy's family his uncle dean appears to be ok but his brother owen is a loose cannon every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile sunny br br the performances are fine vincent ventresca is thomas the man who should have gone to his l a practice instead of making a detour to the small town alexandra holden is sunny a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings kevin alejandro gregg henry brian austin play the men in the family well nicholas turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer br br the film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film,1
683,who is minding the store here how could any producer network executive director let a crew stick the fakest plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel k mart christmas tree is to real and who let dermot mulroney go in front of the camera with painted on grey hair that wouldn't have passed muster in a high school play and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the excellent canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas everybody involved with this plodding slug of a movie writer director actors has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them devoid of any emotion except the obvious expository and contrived maybe this only seems like one of lifetime's worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime what gives folks br br all of that said a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it,0
684,alexander lou star of classics such as 'the super and vs headlines here in this entertaining martial arts fest br br the plot involves the evil abbott white who boasts some humongous and frankly somewhat scary looking white eyebrows enlisting the aid of a ninja clan in order to overthrow the shaolin temple br br this goal he achieves and furthermore wipes out most of it's members although needless to say one or two do manage to survive and rather predictably go on to exact eventual revenge upon the miscreant abbott br br ok so the plot isn't exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity but does anyone watching a film with a title like tang vs aka 'the ninja hunter' really care much for such an inconsequential factor as a plot of course not it's the fights that matter in these films and by gum you get your moneys worth here there's some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from everyone involved in this and rarely a minute seems to goes by without a fight breaking out for some reason br br if your at all into martial arts movies then this is a must see,1
685,frank sinatra did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that it's hard to single one out as the best if i had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as frankie machine the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally kim novak the cold turkey scenes between sinatra and novak are terrifying and heartbreaking the movie is very nearly perfect in fact from saul title graphics to the ground breaking jazz score by elmer bernstein it might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s but it's a must see nevertheless,1

687,this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something they can be better than the pros the main character doug showed off his skills in flying a cessna aircraft which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with maybe make a good investment donate buy a few things but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle not once not twice not even three times yes four times the thing to look most forward to are the multitude 'hollywood in this movie just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence there's another cheesy end sequence then another definitely a movie one must watch to believe and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been,0
688,if you find the depiction of violent murders and wanton police brutality expressed in a plot less film with glacial pacing entertaining then you're bound to enjoy surveillance this film was garbage for both the mind and spirit the notion that this is a thriller is comical that would imply some kind of tension and twists you kept waiting for the story to actually finish starting it never rises above a glorification of weak minded violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life picture all of the violence of no country for old men without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters thrill killers run amok the acting is good mostly but the script is a pile don't bother and tell your friends to don't bother,0
689,rabbit fever is one of those film oddities it's an enjoyable 90 minutes demands little of the viewer and delivers as much and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas br br the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product the narrative is 100 tongue in cheek throughout br br the storyline is strong an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters some enjoyable back story peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story and pleasing conclusions sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new br br rabbit fever has some sharp moments a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of and all credit to them it's not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo i could probably watch it with my mother but there's a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back those moments went you are up for it when you want it to be outrageous and all you get is a dollop of sit com br br i chuckled i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema br br i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do it's a quirky subject a rounded storyline a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes but there's nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment quite the opposite a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack,0
690,at the very beginning the look at a control panel that reads 8 miles of the cost of california and no i didn't that they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast these people must have been morons br br it's good if you're into terrible movies but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever br br wow completely ridiculous but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch how these folks made any money off this is beyond me,0
691,persuaded by the 7 0 points in imdb which is pretty good i decided to watch this movie however i found this movie quiet boring about 2 hours and full of clichés a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie dialogs motions etc you will have to see it he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies perhaps copied too much i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch unfortunately yet again i'm convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4 its too boring and full of clichés,0
692,this was answer to fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right juhi chawla was good and so was sunny deol but it was shah rukh khan who shot to fame as the stalker since then he has become a favourite of the chopra's dilwale dulhaniya le jayenge dil to pagal hai veer zaara and de india shah rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him the scripting was superb and the songs were my favourites are too mere and teri br br after the dismal failure of the underrated yash chopra fought back with darr the dialogues were memorable the k k kiran dialogue is often repeated since darr yash chopra has slipped bit dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with veer zaara which was far far better this was yash chopra's last masterpiece,1
693,as an avid disney fan i was not totally impressed by this movie certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters i am however so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features br br you must check out the moose commentary the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from and the comic relief moose of the story who are voiced by rick moranis and dave thomas two veterans of the famous second city comedy troupe ad lib in character for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of i laughed the whole time the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself do yourself a favor and listen to it,0
694,pepe le moko played by charles boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time a place he can't leave because the moment he does he knows he'll be arrested br br boyer's performance was good and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such a character a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite a letdown a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which i'll mention two first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner that the police wouldn't enter nor the statement by inspector also a decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the but not out seemed to make much sense i also found it difficult to believe that le moko hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the to find her essentially giving himself up i understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the only to find real freedom in his capture because he's shot and killed by the police i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap br br this is worth watching for boyer and to a lesser extent calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent 3 10,0
695,i wanted to love this film so badly i really did but it was a horrible disappointment br br i read jennifer novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time mind you the book had much more depth than this movie in plot and emotional resonance it made you care about the characters it painted a complete picture of phoebe unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the film br br though beautiful and showing some promise in her burgeoning career jordana brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script and christopher eccleston wolf was just an awful choice for the role of wolf both physically and what an awkward looking couple wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character and more physically alluring like he was in the book what's more the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced br br cameron diaz however deserves utmost praise for her performance she took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life a real spirit she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie it's too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable film br br in the book to movie category this is a dreadful translation almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin costner but don't get me started on that one br br i am not usually so harsh in my critiques but i was so disappointed here because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right it did not deliver br br,0
696,i thought i might be disappointed viewing this film again after so many years on the contrary i was more impressed now than in my callow youth with its honesty and brave humour in 1969 the transition among african american groups from a predominant policy of and integration to one of confrontation and self determination was still quite new and more than a little controversial it took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti establishment as the caricatures they often closely in real life special mention should be made of arnold johnson's performance he successfully avoided having his character lapse into either sociopathy or buffoonery i'd rather watch this than to sir with love any old day,1

698,what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of this film does not contain one innovating element if by you refer to pathetic action scenes overacting gluttony in violence blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief then is something swedish film can do without br br how röse and karlsson can agree to 'act' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me and how eva röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast tv promoting it just disappoints me br br this film doesn't contain a story the script is illogical stiff and last but not least just plain bad these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy fantasy containing violence comic strips and trivialized psychological portraits i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors br br i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy,0

701,i saw this movie on a night i couldn't sleep i loved it and searched to find out when it would be on again probably the best movie i have ever seen at the time and even now the cast is full of people i had never seen before but it seems like a real life story based out of nyc this is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure because you see it hear it and feel it from the moment i saw drinking a beer and watching the game i imagined what it must be like to grow up without a father there are so many lines from this movie i use on a daily basis like the personal alone time in the bathroom drinking a 7 11 beverage great film,1
702,i am finally seeing the el padrino movie from what i can see it is an incredible film and lots of action damian is good director but i must admit i love his acting the best br br also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit br br however the film el padrino is a pure 10 action epic why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also br br i am one of those people who love to see artists make it br br b s,1
703,it has been recorded that john ford made the big blockbuster movies so that he could afford to make the small movies that he loved so well wagon master with a young ben johnson is clearly one of his best if not the best of his small movies the location shooting the wagons the intricate work with horses and the inclusion of the plains indian are all trade marks of ford as in many of his other films eisenstein the great russian director's influence is seen in this film the supporting cast including ward bond russell simpson and jane darwell are excellent as well as the many minor character actors ford used including his brother the one who plays the drums while ben johnson went on to win a well deserved supporting oscar for the last picture show his co star harry carey jr did not reach those heights although his father carey sr became a western leading man in ford's early films carey jr spent most of his career in supporting roles for fans of john ford and for fans of western films this one is a must,1
704,this is by far the funniest sitcom that has ever aired on tv i own all 9 seasons on dvd and literally could watch them over and over anyone who does not find this show hilarious heartwarming entertaining and laugh out loud hysterical is crazy kevin james is absolutely one of the most talented comedians out there my boyfriend and i love going to stand up comedy shows in boston where we live and have seen kevin james twice and his brother gary valentine danny once they are both so unbelievably talented and just plan smart with their work there are so many comedians out there that are just awful and kevin and gary really show the true side of real comedy leah although a snob and bitch in real life so i have read is an amazing actress and deserves more credit than any other woman in sitcoms she truly makes the show along with jerry stiller this show is a must see and you will get addicted within one to two episodes,1

706,my girlfriend and i saw this movie when it was originally released the controversy that surrounded the original release teen nudity physical intimacy and unwed pregnancy were subjects that never touched our view of the film we were close to the same age as paul and michelle and were experiencing many of the same intense and confusing emotions we were too young to get caught up in the simplistic at times acting and the corny at times emotional twists this movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story never could have i still remember sitting in the movie theater with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic albiet syrupy final scenes,1
707,ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist this is one of them this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds and bad dialogue eddie is just plain annoying as tony an annoying twit who upon his father don william hickey 's request takes over the family business tony as i said is an annoying little twit this makes the whole movie a complete mess the movie is terribly daffy it's too cartoonish the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness it doesn't work that way believe it or not you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously if you don't take it seriously it will feel too much like a parody the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible,0
708,this is actually a very good surreal mystery movie despite the description that tries to sell it as a sci fi movie balkan stars as a woman haunted by mysterious visions and lost memories that she is trying to piece together she spends the majority of the movie trying to make sense of her visions very atmospheric and effective it is true that kinski does not appear very much in this film but the staring actors are very good there is only an english dubbed version available in the us and the dubbing leaves something to be desired but the actors do a very good job the cinematography by academy award winner vittorio storaro is excellent an earlier giallo by director the fifth cord is also excellent and also lensed by,1
709,this film is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make family entertainment meaning something which is enjoyable to people of all ages this particular wallace gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who like the colors and cute bunnies to their grandparents who understand the adult references br br this film has direction as good as any i've ever seen and i mean that literally it is also packed with tiny bits of humor and each scene has so many humorous details in the background that i'm going to have to buy it if only in order to read all the signs and in w g's world br br i plan to see this movie at least twice more in theaters then buy it on dvd you too should see it,1
710,a pity nobody seems to know this little thriller masterpiece where bigger budgeted movies fail terminal choice delivers lots of thrills shocks and bloody violence a little seen gem that deserves being searched for in your local video shop that anonymous guy beneath is quite right when he says you'll never trust hospitals again it is that effective good ending too not really a twist but it doesn't end the way one thought it would yep that's ellen barkin in an early role,1
711,based on the manga comic of well known artist masamune shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to me br br the story is good but the animation is merely ok while it could should have been mindblowing the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by shirow ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called stand alone complex br br i consider this worth a rental unless you're a fan of shirow and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended,1
712,if you are looking for a phony hollywood action movie this won't be one for you if the truth is what you seek rent or buy this from a true story the movie attempts to capture the heart of what was is happening in south africa and many other places br br for historical knowledge this rates up there with stories such as the pianist schindler's list or nuremberg millions of people today have no clue what apartheid is or that it even exists this movie may help them learn and may even help them dig deeper,1
713,dr wants to save his son julio who's dying of heart disease he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son no i'm not kidding he does the transplant and somehow his son changes from a frail guy into a muscle bound man with a dime store mask that sort of resembles an ape naturally he gets out kills men tears the clothes of women and wreaks havoc this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt arturo martinez and lady wrestler lucy we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot it all ends by copying the end of king kong this is obviously a pretty stupid movie the plot makes little sense there's the gratuitous female nudity a staple of any exploitation film and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake except for the open heart transplant still this does have merit the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors also the dubbed in dialogue was for a film like this well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color which helps we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie,0
714,it's difficult to find anything worth of praise with this movie it's not the worst picture ever made but that's not saying a whole lot the plot is quite incoherent and unbelievable it seems that the producers wanted to make a space movie but decided to make it underwater to cash in at the success of the abyss in some scenes it seems as if the story indeed was set to outer space initially the sub has a landing gear the technicians are worried of a rip in a rubber diving suit at the depths of several kilometers where the pressure would crush the diver and the suit like an empty beer can br br the movie starts out okay with planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub after that the movie takes a plunge along with the siren 2 br br effects are so so the screens are all done on commodore 64 remember this is 1990 not 1983 the sub is controlled like no other sub ever instead of control consoles the officers have keyboards with which they enter long number sequences to control various functions of the ship the interior of the ship isn't too convincing either br br the final scenes leap from awkward to absurd welcome to the fifties you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door br br i fail to see enjoyment factor here the movie is neither good nor hilariously bad mst3k style until you get to the final scene it's like eating a slightly bad apple,0
715,it is fitting that the title character in sydney white is defined from the beginning of the film by her awkwardness because the film like the character tends to begin every scene with a well meant but inappropriate statement then inadvertently making it worse and leaving the viewer in total confusion br br this scenario gets old quick now imagine a hour and a half of this throw on the most predictable storyline imaginable add some vague snow white and the seven dwarfs references and amanda bynes blinking in wide eyed puzzlement and you have sydney white for more of my review http www helium com items sydney white review,0
716,i rented this obscure aussie relic a few years ago to show at a friend s place and it was an instant success the classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly cornball 70 s australian twist the acting isn t exactly shakespeare society stuff here but later mad max star bruce spence is a beautifully understated scarecrow and there are some wonderfull comic turns by gary and robin ramsay as a deliciously 70 s camp fairy godmother father character also note the musical contribution from ex daddy cool frontman ross wilson on the title song in a similar vein to later day aussie comedies such as priscilla queen of the desert good fun,1
717,i suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential but nothing more because boy did the filmmakers botch it the plot is practically incomprehensible the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic and what the hell is a trade rat worst of all though this movie's climax is the anticlimax of all plus the title doesn't seem even remotely accurate the only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty dark haired woman well the blond girl was pretty too but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette anyhoo as with a lot of movies this is one to be seen only on mst3k,0
718,wow i loved this movie this film was filled with plot twists good acting great story and a surprising ending to be completely honest this movie wasn't overly gory it does contain some gore though but was more on the psychological side i read it on the internet the film cost 3000 dollars and was shoot in 8 days amazing this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted even a bit more sinister not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations,1
719,one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy br br as nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that don't make any sense br br the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast forward the play br br and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy in comparison the one of the shining is funfair br br nb a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera they are wrong it isn't the south of france nice cannes but totally the opposite normandy to be simple the beaches of the d day that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun,0
720,where do i start do i say how great the cinematography is do i praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity do i tell how realistic the scenes on ellis island are should i mention that for a change we do not have the cliché scene of viewing statue of liberty by now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a cliché br br now whats not likable two major things one being a modern song score not even a good one to boot br br second nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow that watching paint dry would be an improvement br br the minute running time is to long yet the film seems unfinished we see no scenes of this family in the us our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother i would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search instead of other drawn out scenes br br the film is a near miss br br ratings out of 4 81 points out of 100 imdb 7 out of 10,1
721,such pain pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face i wouldn't say this straight to video south african canadian uk horror flick is awful but its just too bland predictable and there's just very little memorable about it it's a guarantee you'll forget it not too long after watching it i tried watching it last night but had to finish it during the morning as i couldn't keep my eyes open even then i couldn't remember where i got up to which left me watching it from the beginning again the only thing that hit a chord was andreas sharp cinematography of the vast harsh and eerie desert locations a nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling everything else is below par and almost comes off grating like the head scratching revelation of the beast huh the computer generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones but there's too little as there's no hiding the fact that the clichéd script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty that would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic shallow fluff because it never generated any strong lasting suspense but makes it labour on the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket it's your stereotypical bunch scott and warrick grier's performances are colourless and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary,0

723,ok ill be brief this film wasn't just bad it was very very bad with like if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh t on your shoes you know your in hideous film territory after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family it gave me such a vast feeling of self loathing i wanted to do murder don't watch this film i will kill again but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts br br fortunately there is a flipside its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierra br br unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof br br ps worse than the marksman,0
724,i seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out but had avoided seeing it throughout the years i wish i'd waited longer maybe this movie was funny in 1988 i don't know i was younger then but it didn't seem like the world was that different michelle pfeiffer lovely as she is is never convincing mercedes ruehl not only chews scenery but stuffs it in her cheeks like a to save for later dean stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss as james gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the bolshoi and matthew modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of delayed puberty i've ever seen all in all it's not bad enough to make you want to pluck out your eyes with a melon baller but it's not far off,0
725,8 2008 when i originally wrote my comments shortly after first seeing this film i took a critical view feeling that lemmon and matthau had basically phoned in their performances which paired them in a manner they'd done several times previously br br but upon seeing it again it seemed different especially in view that neither of the two main mega stars lived a great deal longer after its release br br with the exception of spiner all of the eight principals are performers with considerable experience and likewise unavoidably a lot longer in tooth than we've seen in many of their other film and t v work but isn't almost everyone br br seeing it again while it certainly won't be regarded as a in any of their careers it is a fun film with a lot of interesting scenery as well br br from my viewpoint it reminds me that many films plays etc can often be looked at either from a very critical viewpoint or looking instead to the lighter side without expecting a film to be another citizen kane or in terms of the two leads another original odd couple it also will provide a continuing piece of nostalgia for lemmon and matthau as well as the others in the cast,1
726,the trailers for this movie promised and this movie delivered exactly what was promised good campy fun with lots of very good looking naked broads if you were expecting a major hollywood movie with major stars stellar budgets and mpaa tamed money shots you will be very disappointed br br however if you are a fan of the old b movies with unknown but very good looking young stars that act amazingly well given the material some hokey but surprisingly well done special effects and very tight naked nubile bodies this movie is almost heaven,0

728,is not a terrible movie but it is quite forgettable the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye strain special effects are imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesn't gel what was needed was some dialogue and more tongue in cheek humor br br i can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film,0
729,this was a fantastic movie about two people one a young teenage girl and the other a middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones br br both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to the script although written by seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view and at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie br br the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless i would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one it is clear in this film that you are not alone,1
730,kristy swanson plays an elite who is supposed to have knocked off a tv reporter for a group of bad guys but once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the tv reporter's life is spared the life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment such is the basis for a movie called supreme sanction br br supreme waste of time is more like it we see character beat up pummel and kill men far bigger than her and she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who can't for some reason do away with this super having one woman do away and beat all these men makes the movie seem so gay it is too predictable once you figure character is going to win out anyway thus making the film boring and inept br br kristy swanson is decent actress who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes supreme sanction is not one of her better efforts however,0
731,never have i seen a movie like this didn't plan on seeing it but it was worth the turn of the tv channel i am mostly a scifi movie watcher but i would be more than happy to add this one to my collection it starts out as a one sided film with a simple love triangle then became something a little different can't tell more then that but it does involve two guys and one girl juts not the way you would expect also this movie starred hugo weaving from the matrix and the lord of the rings in a role i would not have expected very funny guy this movie is playing on here tv but if you do not have satellite it is worth a rent so give it a try you won't be disappointed,1
732,oh dear quite how alfred hitchcock north by northwest spellbound the 39 steps could turn out this nasty cheapjack shocker is beyond me don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings there aren't any this is just horrid seedy and cheap the one redeeming feature is the home life of the inspector who leads the investigation his wife fancies herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves up her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband this is amusing and just about saved me putting the film in the 'awful' bracket but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant i've ever seen i believe this was hitchcock's next to last film perhaps someone was trying to tell him something,0
733,at first glance of this mini i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn't return to the cast both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western br br cherokee jack jackson haysbert played an excellent bad guy and louis gossett jr was as always true to form with his excellent acting skills br br the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes including one of the best where the valiant shoot out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film return to lonesome dove was to me almost up to the quality of the first of the series the next 2 follow ups with james garner as call just didn't make it for me and that marries pea eye how the heck did that get in their that was a total mismatch of characters the first 2 of the series made the epic story the next 2 in no way were of the same quality br br now if the first 2 could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today,1
734,ok i normally don't add comments on movies but i finally watched a movie that was so utterly full of bullsh t and riddled with incompetence that i just had to warn people about blackwater valley exorcist is loosely about a wife beating pederast priest and this podunk family of horse freaks and to make a long story short the youngest daughter who was molested by the priest but in love with the hillbilly ranch hand gets possessed along with a heroic god shunning mexican gardener who once participated in a exorcism the wife beating pederast priest manage to save the day but not before the possessing demon is able to jump over to a hooker who the town sheriff made blow him all in all this movie is the biggest pile of useless i could get very descriptive with this part but why waste my energy on this movie sh t i've ever seen any and all persons associated with the making of this movie should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the earth with their useless spawn,0

736,one of the worse surfing movies i've ever seen this movie is so bad i don't know where to begin okay let's start with the premise some dude from the mainland who barely knows how to surf travels to hawaii and enters a big wave contest which he more or less expects to win a good analogy for those who don't surf would be a that of a grossly overweight chain smoker slapping on a pairs of running shoes and entering the la marathon with expectations of winning no way and the contest is held on the north shore which conjures up images of 15 foot waves but contest day the waves are maybe 6 foot the acting what acting if you must see this woof see it on tv don't waste your money renting it if you want to see a pretty good surfing movie granted it is flawed but that's another story rent big wednesday,0
737,a refreshing black comedy starring some of australia's finest in the same way that lock stock and 2 smoking barrels captured the funny side of london gangsters two hands rips through the sydney underworld it wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone br br an australian classic if australia could pull more rabbits like this out its hat it might actually have a film industry worth keeping an eye on,1
738,this is a great premise for a movie the overall plot is very original interesting and something to think about however poor production an obviously small budget acting from the main character and several side actors really detract from this would be classic an up and coming producer should try to this story and give this basicly half hearted atempt a proper release,0
739,this is a film that has to be taken in context it shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does and you shouldn't go in expecting blade runner the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far and it's a far more zany ride br br essentially the film is a science fiction set in future shot in hong kong as is obvious about a society where it's illegal to procreate sho reprises a similar role from dead or alive 2 and riki is a detective for the birth control cops takashi miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly cantonese whilst sho and riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak japanese and a few speak english people have criticised the english as being wooden but i found no problems with it also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that takashi miike was anti homosexual he may very well be and not all artists have to be left wing but i can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals he merely calls back philosophies of ancient greece when homo or bisexuality was more common the film contains similar proportions of action packed and poignant moments to doa 2 although in this film the action is more martial arts based and are done in a very good hong kong style the cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and it's nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in hollywood these days basically there's a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments it's a great finish to the series you could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isn't that part of the charm,1
740,the core message is strong the cast has given it their best shot the packaging is excellent but the screenplay is seriously over dramatized and every cliche in the book on women's suffering in india has been over used to the max,0
741,i have to differ from the other comments posted amid sporadic funny moments there are a lot of actors trying too hard to be funny the strain shows i watched this with two friends on another friend's recommendation none of us were thrilled,0
742,seeing this movie in previews i thought it would be witty and in good spirits unfortunately it was a standard case of the funny bits were in the preview not to say it was all bad but the good bits were in the preview br br if you are looking for an adolescent movie that will put you to sleep then watch this movie,0
743,i consider myself a huge horror movie fan one night i wanted to just rent some newer horror movies to make fun of then i rented milo i was so surprised by this movie it scared the hell outta me that's not something i can say very often usually halloween only scares me br br two other friends watched it with me and were left with a disturbed feeling a good feeling if you ask me after watching a horror movie if you are unaffected then what's the point br br this movie was original it didn't follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie that's why movies like valentine bombed for me br br of course many are left with unanswered questions as most horror movies do it is worth the rent though,1
744,ok so this film may not have won any oscars but it is not a bad film the original d o a is undoubtedly a better film but that does not mean this film is bad br br the film stars dennis quaid in one of his early roles when he was first becoming really famous after the right stuff made him a star and a very lovely looking meg ryan when she was still now quite famous br br this is more of an update of the 1950 film rather than a remake since the setting is different and the characters too are different the plot is pretty much the same a man this time an english professor at the university of texas at austin is poisoned and he has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why meg ryan plays a young college student who tries to help him jane kaczmarek plays quaid's estranged wife in a low key but intense performance she steals every scene she is in daniel stern also in an early role before home alone made him famous plays quaid's colleague charlotte rampling is fine too in a supporting role br br the entire cast is top notch the film is stylish with a quick pace that keeps you guessing until the end br br i think this is a film that is certainly worth watching as a thriller and as a modern version of a classic film,1
745,some good set design good songs though like the other guy said they aren't performed with much energy bea arthur trying her to do something with the material had an occasional good one liner as friend vera and helped move the song bosom buddies along other than that there's nothing here that's worth your time slow pacing incredibly bad not very good singing except from robert preston an awful script bad acting except from bea and a horrible lead actress who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy life loving mame the heads over at warner bros were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury who had done it so well on broadway and instead use ball who wasn't nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier couldn't act the part the right way at all and used a painful as an excuse for singing even if perhaps because making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it she just isn't mame auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great for the most part there's nothing here that's great engaging or interesting at all forget it unless you're a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong hopefully after seeing this you'll realize she was only human,0
746,this is probably the greatest war film and certainly one of the greatest films there's no sentimentality no patriotic agenda not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this bleak glimpse of what we can only call hell it's this quiet rigor and lack of manipulation that give the film its astounding power there aren't any attempts to make a hero out of protagonist tamura either he's just a poor doomed sap trying to stay alive in a world of horror who hopes but isn't sure he can hang on to his humanity in the process fierce lack of cant and illusion make fires on the plain stand alone ichikawa died february 2008,1
747,well this latest version of mansfield park seemed to try and take the edginess of the 1999 theatrical version outright copied some of the ideas from it in fact but tone things down a bit to bring it more in line with the original story unfortunately the result is a rather lackluster and schizophrenic production and as with all the other versions of mansfield park out there the character of fanny price is no where to be found instead there is a strangely child like bleached blond woman running around who never really fully develops as a character at least in the 1999 movie the character they call fanny price is firmly established as rebellious tomboy who is too clever for her own good this fanny price is a complete enigma someday i would really like to see a dramatization of mansfield park that actually includes a depiction of the character of fanny as she was written by jane austen a sweet kind compassionate girl with a timid personality and frail constitution she is reserved in manner and painfully honest but also strong in her convictions loyal extremely intelligent and remarkably astute a bit of a late it is not until her eighteenth year that she finally begins to make the transition from awkward adolescent to self possessed young woman and she wants nothing more in life than to be of some real use to those she loves most it's a wonderfully complex character that i look forward to one day seeing faithfully portrayed,0
748,this was a disgrace to the game farcry i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare besides the bad acting the visual effects stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop the movie is not worth watching at all the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the cuffs guess the she got the keys to handcuffs all the time i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday and i they will invest some good cash to get the visual effects right and the right as well as the acting right but till then don't waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a farcry lover,0
749,just saw the film tonight in a preview and it's a film for kids only it does not improve or add to the original disney film in any way there is a corny scottish pastiche style throughout not helped by weak writing where motives are lumped in by the and acting that is uneven and often unengaging despite what reads like a decent cast i have no problem with the wee dog although there is a certain skippy the bush kangaroo see below quality about his shots br br for those that don't know skippy was an australian kids' tv series from the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories it is said that to get poor old skippy to act they stuck an elastic band round his muzzle that he then tried to get off with his paws sort of appearing to be communicating with the human actors bobby has a similar range and you just don't buy his series of heroic rescues at all br br advice would be to take kids aged 8 12 below that they might be scared above that if they or you love it good luck to you but this is strictly cardboard cut out film making for the undemanding it's a missed opportunity since there is real pathos and cuteness in the story of bobby and this film fails to deliver it,0
750,'o brother where art is a gleeful retelling of homer's 'odyssey' set in 1930s mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers coen three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure and more than their share of adventure in this delightful film george clooney is in fine ingenuous form as the chatty amiable leader of the trio but the real acting kudos go to john turturro and tim blake nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts dubbed the bottom boys' by clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river the three cut a record under that homespun nom de plume for the cash and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status the film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical and there are some incredible feats of film making here the scene at the kkk rally is a real doozy and is so similar to the scene when dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'the wizard of oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism and what an amazing work of plagiarism it is without giving away the ending i must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory on a par with the spectacular finale of 'magnolia' another one of my favorites 'o brother' is a must see a perfect 10,1
751,what exactly do people expect when they watch an al adamson film are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories you'd think so by some of the reviews al adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy not much more so if you go into them knowing that already it helps and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value first off this starts by ripping off the end theme music from outer limits so you know things are looking promising this is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital of course nurse sherri tends to his needs and all and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her and nurse sherri begins to change no longer the nice nurse she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects there's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of co workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo this is not bad if you're a cult film fan but it may be bad if you're a spiderman fan because you won't like it at times this actually lurches towards respectability for adamson anyway but then it itself with some ridiculous event if you enjoy adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure keep digging 7 out of 10,1
752,these cartoon writers are unrelenting with their corny and fun puns the first shot we see in here is an island prison with the following written above its big gates alka fizz prison no noose is good noose inside the prison the first sign we see is welcome have a seat they then show an electric chair br br corny gives way to clever however as our favorite wolf is seen behind bars with pen in hand he literally draws a door next to him and then escapes through it in no time he has criss crossed the united states zipped up through canada and is in the northern part of that country it's there we see the canadian royal mounted police and of course our hero droopy known here as sgt he has the assignment of catching the at large criminal from alka fizz so with his trusty little blue horse he goes out in the heavy snow to track down the wanted wolf br br from that point we get the normal story droopy always being a step ahead of the wolf no matter what the latter does and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny sight gags droopy even pops out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain there is nowhere the wolf can go or do plastic surgery to escape the intrepid sgt nobody by the way in the history of cartoons perhaps has more exaggerated reactions either than this wolf each time he sees his nemesis his screams facial and body stretched out in horror each time is a big part of the sight gags br br you'd think this one joke cartoon would get monotonous but it doesn't it's more good stuff from tex avery and the gang just one of 24 cartoons in the complete theatrical collection dvd with wonderful looking restored visuals,1
753,just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed a few shocking funny moments the hollow carla a urinating harpy in the dreamland and two competing interesting premises similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn't make it lynchian you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances br br positive things dr maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute carla's father and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards br br i get the hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together but they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it it's not so bad it's good it's just so bad it's boring,0
754,you know the old saw about a train wreck the one about how you can't look away this movie isn't that good the only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater you might catch a nap br br tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic unsure actor in this production br br i didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place i admit if it weren't basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas my wife and i wouldn't have gone god i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves i leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was but she beat me to the punch br br i'm not kidding it's putrid only david terrific as usual work saves this review from being only 1 star br br the story is cloying insulting and stupid as might be expected for a movie in this genre although the recent curious george was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable the acting is mostly poor the decision to update the chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst it does not work br br the chipmunks of old were clever mischievous and sly these chipmunks are dumb somewhat mean spirited obnoxious and in a surprise needy to the point of uselessness br br either as a retrospect a tribute or as a completely new production this film totally fails the final straw my son couldn't wait to leave spend your money renting curious george instead,0
755,i've just seen this movie in a preview and i can only recommend to watch it it was about 90 minutes long and when it was over i felt like it could go on for hours the stories of the protagonists are so realistic and you feel really at home the movie basically consists of dialogs but i wasn't bored a minute 18 people of really different characters and each one of them acted out so well i had to laugh felt awkward was sad and still felt happiness all in all it is a movie that shows the different kinds of people in our society the way they communicate and how love has changed and nowadays is handled as an economic thing dating becomes something that is similar to an audition the whole audience loved it so please watch it if there's a possibility you'll love it,1
756,although this movie doesn't have the darkness of the books it is in my opinion a great movie it's great campy fun with the beautiful stuart townsend as lestat he may not have the blond hair and blue eyes that are so vividly described in the book but to be fair he would not look good with blond hair and lestat is most definitely about looking good he moves like the predator i always imagined lestat would have br br the visual effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing it's not interview with the vampire so don't try to compare the two interview is louis' story this is a cut and paste version of in any case i highly recommend,1
757,the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what there is a scarecrow murdering people there only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people one by one whats the scarecrows secret will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all this is a low budget movie and it shows sound is ok but picture is really corny the plot script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren't that many but the few there is ranges from bad to ok for a low budget that is there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie that is if your a horny teenager if not skip the movie all together another complete waste of time and money so don't see it goes for fans too,0
758,incident on and off a mountain road is don entry in mick garris' masters of horror series coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the irresistibly weird bubba ho tep but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman this time it's a young woman driving down a mountain road after a head on crash she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps only for the maniac to show up seconds later and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers with lines such as expect the unexpected the only real highlight for me was the presence of tall man angus scrimm coscarelli tries his best to implement as much horror imagery as possible with things such as a rotted corpse of a dead baby but because it's all so silly on the whole it's difficult to take this piece seriously this is the first episode in the series and the first that i've seen i really hope they get better,0
759,as a reviewer has already commented this made for tv comedy is up there amongst the best football parodies ever but having failed to video it when it was first aired i now find that it isn't around in any format ok so this has only polled 17 votes to date but a 9 average does seem to suggest something special basically i suppose it's a case of tough luck if you missed it 'cos it's no longer available to view,1
760,if you haven't seen this movie than you need to it rocks and you have to watch it it is so funny and will make you laugh your guts out so you have to watch it and i saw it about a billion and a half times and still think it is funny so you have to yes i have memorized the whole movie and could quote it to you from start to finish you must see this move it is also cute because it is half a chick flick if you don't watch it then you are really missing out this movie even has cute guys in it and that is always a bonus so in summary watch the movie now and trust me you will not be making a mistake did i mention the music is good too so you should like it if you enjoy music this is a movie that they rated correctly and it will work for anyone,1
761,great movie chucky is by far the funniest character in a movie jennifer tilly tiffany makes this movie even better well before chucky died tiffany and him were together but like ten years later tiffany gets chucky back as a doll and brings him back to life it was a great movie scary and definetly funny only because chucky 10 10,1
762,i have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago and i have to say thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back the acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped perhaps the tv will explode and put me out of my misery the only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it though most of which i wish would disappear as far as the movie is concerned the special effects as sh t dante who thinks a guy dressed in skin tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie the voice of dante is pathetic nobody finds it threatening or scary at all please tv i beg you to blow up,0
763,it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery br br actually this isn't as bad as some critics say but it isn't good either it is amusing and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line making it a conflicted uneven poor work and speaking of poor the quality is terrible due to the era in which this was filmed but that is not the only reason br br the story herein is inferior even to the conan line but moreover it loses itself in the red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger ploy and entirely forgets its purpose if it ever had one br br it's entertaining but in a low budget guilty pleasure b kind of way br br it rates a 4 2 10 from br br the fiend,0
764,everyone is a genius in something albert einstien was a genius in science william shakespeare was a genius in literature and the boys from the chasers war on everything are truly comedy geniuses their satire tv show is a constant hit on the australian broadcast commission abc after a small start as a satire newspaper the chasers popularity when given their own television show never short on controversy with the cast members will do everything some of it even being arrested for chris taylor going on sunrise a very popular live morning television show and telling his partner to f k off creating a fake and driving into high security area and doing a very funny satire of a australian ad about nicotine by following smokers around yelling out no gary no no gary no while controversial the show is funny and worthy of running for years to come,1
765,a flesh eating octopus where does that guy boaz what the davidson keep getting inspiration anyway even for the low low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people genre and me this one is just beyond awful the octopus is one of the lamest laziest weakest monsters i've ever seen i think he just ended up in the east river because sea world got sick of him the actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them bunch of idiots that way he'll never learn you guys want all the other giant killer octopuses that's the correct plural by the way to laugh at him meanies br br up to stop the octopus are wind razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent nick and his partner who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus hooray octopus won the fight a couple more and he's going to evolve the scars in my mind stay nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing doesn't he have a gun or something but no that magically doesn't help either br br okay enter sea cop's love interest rachel is this based on some comic book or something anyway together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park they hope this helps cos it's the 4th of july in a couple of days and the octopus might join the party and you don't know what he's like when he's drunk rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won't end while nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops br br but all's crappy that ends crappy nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh you know on tummy vision this would probably get an r in real life i'd say all ages but i kinda like all ages so my final idea is suitable for absolutely nobody there's no sex no gore no nothing now forget this movie ever existed join the club,0
766,well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didn't see any humor he doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo but i didn't think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesn't make the story funny br br back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesn't want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies what's so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldn't wear it and vice versa br br maybe to someone who doesn't follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to him but it's a fact of life or any bit time sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh br br the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltin's animation favorites from the national film board of canada,1
767,i love documentaries they are among my favorite genres of film before seeing this film i hadn't seen one that i hadn't liked br br the premise for this film is a great one the execution is well done there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate childish inept putz i appreciate his passion for film but quit your whining if you're short on funds maybe you shouldn't have so many kids or spend so much money on alcohol maybe you should have gone to film school or at least graduated from high school maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision br br there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting funny and poignant to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass if you want to do a documentary on a film maker why not do one on someone from china or iran a film maker with real problems br br two final questions br br who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now br br how many times did this guy say man,0
768,the worst thing i have ever watch br br the movie is pure trash all the things is bad on this movie the direction screenplay arts cinematography cast or anything else br br may i say more br br the main character is an boy it has to have 20 years of age approximately but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old in addition he is an very bad actor br br the editing tries to save it but with that very bad material in hands they can't do miracles br br as i said the cast is poor the text is poor that it doesn't help the actors br br i learned how to do not make a movie,0
769,come on now how did all of these talented actors actresses end up in this mess was it some sort of blackmail lost bet situation vinnie you are a muscle man be what you were born to be br br the hot tub scene the scrabble scene i was expecting to hear the needle dragging over the record sound at any point br br and what was up with him carrying around the priceless dickens manuscript with him let's see i'm drunk at a bar why not pull out the priceless dickens manuscript i'm going to meet some questionable thugs down on the edge of the thames why not take my priceless dickens manuscript br br crapola br br terrible avoid,0
770,as a fan of the old doctor who and after the mediocre fox movie i was dubious of this new series of doctor who i gave it a chance though and am so glad i did br br yes some episodes aren't as brilliant as others but they are all enjoyable and yes eccleston's doctor is far from any we've had before but eccleston's doctor is just about the best there is his performance is at times comical at others dramatic sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic br br this and bille piper as rose make this series a cut above the rest camille is also fantastic as rose's mum and there is a depth to this series not present previously this series is incredibly powerful especially considering its sci fi i mean who'd have thought you could ever have felt sorry or even cried for a dalek prior to this how many times in this series' history have we had moments like those with rose's dad the emergency doctor and the 'you were fantastic so was i' final speech i advise anyone whether a fan of doctor who or even tv drama to buy this set on dvd it truly is fantastic br br now only 4 episodes through the latest series and looking forward to the new i have to say that david doctor is just not as good of course you may disagree but i don't think his doctor is capable of those emotional moments seen in the previous series i also have to say that in my opinion so far this series has not been as good as the last however the return of sarah jane was a fantastic episode a true gem not to say this series is not good just not quite as good br br so whether you like it or not and whether you prefer tennant or eccleston the doctor is back and he's here to stay fantastic almost as many fantastic 's as the doctor,1

772,koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down they got too carried away with stock footage and photography so little content the executive producer puts his own image in the film its just pretentious maybe if they had more than 3 million to spend maybe it would have been something i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad but godfrey the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together,0
773,i don't normally give movies a 1 although i am a heartless critic i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile that is to say watchable the main thing i look for is a coherent plot if it has that alone i can watch it let me start by saying this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie this is more like an elementary school project gone horribly wrong and i've seen every sci fi movie special that was ever made br br many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like this played like a made for tv etc etc and i kept saying oh come on i wish they'd think of a real criticism well this is worse much worse this is truly the worst thing i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time and i've seen every movie uwe boll made this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time even 5 minutes of it there was one good scene and it was the end p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall now for the serious criticism br br the script is poorly written the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show and don't even get me started on the screen zoom in transitions ugh someone actually watched this thing edited it and then said ok release it i would have rather burned this than release it in closing all i can say is thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature my advice don't rent it if you do you'll be glad you have stop and eject too,0
774,susan sarandon she made this movie for me i've never appreciated her acting more than as i did in this movie she really acted as though she were adele august i can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable br br natalie portman as ann august helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie the movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral br br i gave this movie an eight rating but susan received a ten from me because of her performance as far as relationship movies go beaches and terms of endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie but i highly recommend it,1
775,this movie is one of the worst i've ever seen even being hangover didn't help the plot is lousy if existent the relatively large number of beautiful girls are unable to help i guess seeing an episode of temptation island with the sound turned of would give the same kind of experience do not see this flick,0
776,eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned blackwell hotel to clean it out as community service they soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath kane who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs it doesn't help that the guard watching over them steven has had a previous run in with the beast four years earlier br br a guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value see no evil is a good example of this it features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining the premise sounds like a mixture between friday the 13th saw 2 and halloween resurrection i really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well it was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable screenwriter dan madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently the death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome director gregory dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills br br the acting is pretty bland and unremarkable this is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them it was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable kane is surprisingly mediocre i was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job a second rate jason voorhees if you will the rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers br br while the death scenes are gory they aren't necessary scary there's really no suspense just some gory death scenes because of this the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value also if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one it will do little to change your opinion in the end see no evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching rating 6 10,0
777,like the troll from bluth's a troll in central park lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie we're supposed to like him because he's nice but that's about all he is br br his character design is unappealing the top of his head is a sort of dome that is than the pudgy bottom half of his head br br and penguins should not have teeth i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor gilbert gottfried with his weenie little voice provided by martin short looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak br br tim curry who is usually delightful at being evil does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice not the supposedly menacing main villain br br the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin marina who is just as dull as both of her suitors br br worst of all is the pacing we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more this time in dialogue this time in song br br barry manilow may be a great songwriter but in animated films like this and his songs feel limp and listless especially the ballads the only song i liked was the 1930's ish good ship misery song br br i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes and that could have caused some of the problems though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it,0
778,i think this show is awesome i love it and i love fabian not in a romantic kind of way but if i was there i would totally support fabian like haley did and the other girls yeah i mean if they're why don't you want to fight them back fabian is the only who have guts to confront people and say what he thinks not just stay and suck it fabian 100 i love haley too because shes like a normal girl who doesn't want to be with cows and bugs and grass everywhere and sleep in a warm bed with servants i mean if you have the chance and the money why wouldn't you do that and fabian too fabian brought pizza and just like 2 or 3 people said thanks i mean he spend money,1
779,i got hold of this film on dvd with the title evil never sleeps it gives front cover billing to carrie ann moss but she plays such a minor character that i didn't really notice her in the film br br i'm afraid that i consider this one of the worst purchases i have ever made the dialogue was stilted and the delivery wooden i found the acting to be disconnected from the plot graham's performance to me was of someone who's wondering whether she's left the gas on at home br br all in all both my wife and i found this film painful to watch and it is not a valuable addition to my collection watch it at your peril but spending 90 minutes having your fingernails pulled out would probably be a better way to spend your time,0
780,i was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip although it started out slowly i found that the realism in depicting the ship the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching the protagonist was destined to be challenged grow and change on this voyage and i wanted to be there for it i was not disappointed the series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in between often in the same scene the same breath there was a wealth of emotional interaction and expression relentless and compelling to observe the movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next br br edmund talbot is a complex character the likes of which we don't see often we may know where the captain stands or mr but they are older men set in their ways talbot was young and arrogant still learning testing himself and being tested he struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched that grew with each hard taught experience i appreciate the excellent characterization it's too rare in movies and television,1
781,the rise of punk music was scarcely documented on film and most people tend to focus on the happenings of other cities such as london or new york penelope managed to preserve a snapshot of los angeles circa '79 which proves a vibrant and diverse art music community had spawned which rivalled any other to some the bands read like a who's who of now legendary american punk black flag x circle jerks germs fear purists argue that vital bands were missed weirdos flesheaters and that the movie was the cause of an onslaught of suburban poseurs and macho violence however the issues touched upon in the film remain relevant the intensity of the music remains unmatched and the influence continues to be seen and heard in the cliques fashions of today,1
782,despite the all star cast this attempt at epic fails it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too too clever social commentary br br it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says isn't that clever am i not smart isn't that biting social commentary and sadly the answer is always ummmm no wearying self absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera in the worst sense of the term than a movie and an obvious attempt at television immortality thankfully it died young empire falls falls flat,0
783,this film is really really bad it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but i am not sure what i watched it and was very disappointed it promised a lot but delivered nothing at all the characters are shallow and wooden and the music if you can call it that is dreadful there are of course all the creatures and animated beings but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects not the be all and end all of a movie i agree but in a movie that is based around them it's a very important factor for me a very sad attempt and should be avoided,0
784,crispin way of acting and not only his is tremendous you really want to believe him because his body language and performing fits the person perfect he gives this extraordinary bit of personality that makes this movie a cult as well as which role is done very well by dennis hopper it's about choosing the right or wrong side without logical thinking about the scene friendship is more imported and that's exactly what i think is what makes choices this difficult rivers edge lets you experience this with serious tones and family i really enjoyed it watching i saw it a month ago for the first time but if you like a nice 80s feel this is the one that you have to see i'ts a same that i didn't know of it earlier,1
785,a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore however it is not an excuse for poor writing it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical the dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training br br i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it with that being said no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself that was perfect i see better character acting on canadian television br br this movie had a paper thin plot bad acting poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason if your looking for a quick scare rent anything else even the cable guy was a scarier film after watching this film i think i would have been better off watching a re run on the x files,0
786,the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter aside from that the flicks are as demonic as their hero in this basically unnecessary sequel freshly separated ben ritter and his little hellraiser junior michael oliver who never needs screen time ever again move to a new town infested with willing ben eventually picks played by the most underused original snl er laraine newman whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least to add on to junior's torture it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie who coincidentally has a sweet single mother played by yasbeck the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother through adoption you can see where the plot goes from here searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth so i guess i'll go with the cherry bomb in the toilet gag that makes back to the future's james one of the many grown up victims that guy's always playing school authority figures jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film but sadly there is no appearance from the bow tie er i mean killer michael richards that made problem child all the more fun on a serious note i'm sure these films whether abusive parents saw them or no did wonders for the red headed children of america let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption oh and dog poop jokes gotta have dog poop jokes,0
787,my family truly enjoyed this movie as far as what this movie will do for rugby in the usa well i am sure that will be debatable but as for me and others around me i know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and i personally gained more respect for the game you may wonder how this possible especially since the movie does not dive in and explain rugby but the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life the film was inspirational as well as entertaining it made us laugh and cry the chemistry between sean astin big budah and sean faris worked well some may think the movie is a little cliché but i seriously wish hollywood made more movies like this i couldn't help drawing analogies of the game and life's struggles at the end of it i found myself examining my own life to see what i needed to do better in order to be the best person i could be honestly i was grateful this movie taught morals values and teamwork there is so much to the contrary after watching this i really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like coach,1
788,there are so many holes in the plot it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together i don't know much about george zucco but i've seen him in two movies obviously he has been cast as the loving father mad scientist vampire guy he looks so ordinary i'm surprised that he ended up in the genre this is the typical i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army by transferring wolf blood or is it coyote to his hired hand he turns him into a werewolf glen strange who was one of karloff's as the frankenstein monster plays the kindly lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor at first the scientist is able to control when his name can be transformed but like the invisible man suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice golly miss brooks she wants to leave but her father the doctor won't allow that he is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked it's not a very good movie the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the spanish moss once again the townsfolk are a bunch of morons who look like they escaped from a bad western one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era there's also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her,0
789,i paid attention and enjoyed the very rich expressions capability of the main actress julianne nicholson i don't have words to describe how much have i been enchanted all the actors and actresses played well especially i noticed the solid good character who has been consistent in foreseeing the future andy richter who played carl i think that the idea to show a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions and the several consulting meetings is like the real world jay mohr who played ed the future husband also played very real behavior but i want to emphasize again the point of very rich expressions repertoire which julianne nicholson is capable of and does so naturally was overwhelming for me indeed the subject which this movie handles seems to me as very important and touches strongly meaningful thoughts of many people i've seen this movie several times and have not been bored it raises again and again in my thoughts,1
790,just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on imdb com even though i've been a user for more than 9 years the reason that i watched this is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me first of all the gore in this film didn't shock me not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap don't get me wrong i'm all against censorship but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of sh t it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like august underground that film is terrible to watch but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is in the case of it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people i prefer films that shock because they are well done and thought through like gaspar noe's films or takashi miike's or funny games or man bites dog those films will stick with you for a while this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow and the only thing that will stick with me is the thought that somewhere out there there are people getting aroused by watching this sh t if you read this please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself this of course does not apply to gore hounds who just love splatter you're cool peace,0
791,i had a hard time sitting through this every single twist and turn is predictable you're sitting there just waiting for it waiting for it and yes there it is just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie or 10 minutes out et cetera br br smart writing no br br torture porn no there's no nudity other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity yes no nudity br br there's no suspense at all in this thriller the only good part about this movie is the ending but i'm not going to spoil that br br i'm giving it a 2 10 a 1 10 would be a horrible b movie this movie had better acting,0
792,before i saw this film i didn't really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away from the credits i was falling of my seat i just couldn't contain myself the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy is the absolute double for the jewish barber who comes back from fighting in the war due to the heroics of the barber he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had but things went wrong and stolz was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish 'the due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for and consequently takes his the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic it the morals which society could only dream about in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the and which it entailed and it definately works because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest most prominent things such as war,1
793,night hunter is a sold b style action movie get a life and grow up people don the dragon wilson is a kick boxer hall of fame and not an actor if your looking for an oscar it's not here brother looking for kick ass action movie with lower then low budget this is it the plot line may have been a little thin but what b movie isn't i understand everybody is a critic and how one man's junk is another man's treasure get real people judging every movie like it is an oscar contender just silly awesome fight scenes mixed with a new twist on vampire moves see it if your a fan rent something else if your a hater,1
794,i not only consider this to be the best film that jon voight midnight cowboy coming home has ever done but a real tribute to teachers br br despite incredible odds pat conroy voight managed to reach a group of students and bring them from nowhere to a basic literacy and awareness of the world his methods made be criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like mr hume cronyn but teachers like conroy will always be winners br br voight really showed that he had a love for teaching and that it was a natural high for him he didn't overplay the role and i found him to be totally believable voight is br br besides a love of teaching we also see another important point in this film no matter how good you are at your job if you rock the boat the bureaucrats will get you,1
795,another enjoyable warner flick i really liked john garfield in this though i'm wondering why cagney wasn't in the role perhaps it was too similar to angels with dirty faces i mean it's another dead end kids story of sorts too but i really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama the boys work great with garfield a nice sequence was the whole swimming scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster br br one negative comment claude rains was grossly miscast as the detective the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse,1
796,i chose this movie really for my husband who works in radio broadcasting i thought that it would be more of a movie that he would enjoy and relate too though it was from the eighties so it was a little dated this movie really draws you in at times you just want to strangle the host barry at times you just want to send some of the bigots who call in to a true concentration camp at times you really feel sorry for barry because he has truly gotten too big for his jeans if you know what i mean it was on the drama channel on encore so i am thinking this is a true story if you truly love dramas you will love this even if you don't know all the ins and outs of the broadcasting business if you are an alec baldwin fan and are watching it to see him you shouldn't his part is really a bit part in this movie,1
797,was the last book to feature miss marple written by agatha christie the official final case 'sleeping murder' was written in the forties and i've always had a very soft spot for it i loved the characters and they are lovingly brought to life in this excellent bbc adaptation with joan terrific as ever as miss marple br br on the whole it is very faithful to the book a few characters are dropped the first new murder is slightly different and a couple of new characters are introduced personally i felt that the added character of lionel peel was unnecessary and rather irritating tour guide madge was irritating in a different way but often quite amusing it's largely because of lionel that i don't award 10 out of 10 the other characters are beautifully done especially helen cherry as a dignified miss temple and all of the three weird sisters but particularly margaret who gives a towering performance as she threatens to go over the top towards the end but just avoids it the female bodyguards are good value too and the episode contains one of my favourite lines 'an ' br br this is another relatively early bbc marple that looks wonderful and is has a gloriously nostalgic feel to it highly recommended,1
798,alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels i was a huge fan of margaret book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money br br although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton this is a really terrible film the script is horrible and full of clichés ann cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her br br the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy feral villain lord fenton sean bean's performance is along the lines of the man you love to hate and portrays an unsafe sex symbol br br but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script br br don't waste your money on this film unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance,0
799,david morse and andre braugher are very talented actors which is why i'm trying so hard to support this program unfortunately an irrational plot and very poor writing is making it difficult for me i'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them,1
800,a couple of weeks after i saw this movie it began to remind me of john carpenter's in the mouth of madness not for the story for the atmosphere the fast elements of surprise and the dreamlike sequences on the other hand this movie mixes very well the image and the music note the 4th chapter in the movie,1
801,this is a great movie i read the brief synopsis and was unimpressed but as i watched it mainly for caroline it grew on me br br it's such a nice change to see a movie where girls young women are not punished for their sexuality the girls are given full license to explore and even the chance to make mistakes without ridiculous repercussions br br some of the scenes are absolutely hilarious and many of them the supposedly erotic scenes which were not over the top or distasteful the male characters in the movie were brilliant david boreanaz was great as the fickle hunk and what is great is that the movie doesn't make us hate him all that much the other two younger male characters were good too without being overbearing br br this is one of the best movies i've seen that has girls growing up and is quite empowering to see how the they realise their mistakes but eventually come through and carry on with their lives rather than drag their mistakes along with them,1
802,here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game turkey shoot gymkata and the running man br br certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work generally bland action sequences a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout br br take for example towards the end of the film when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep upon discovery of the said corpse the villains response bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all  they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit br br however i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode even if his screen time is very limited br br not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b movie enthusiasts,0
803,this is one of the best czech movies i have ever seen the director did excellent work there is great camera and the actors are really great i like war movies so i really liked this one i would recommend it to anyone who wants to know something about czech pilots during 2nd world war and their life after the war in communism,1
804,when the gilmore girls started in germany i did not want to watch them because for me it was just something which was not unique it was a series and i even did not know someone in it later on i realized that edward hermann is part of the cast of overboard a movie i absolutely adore i had to watch it once with a friend and never stopped since it's just fun you have the feeling that it is okay to have sex before being married and it's okay to be a coffee junkie and to eat unhealthy stuff all the time i do not do these things all the time but when i do these things i feel a little bit like a gilmore girl even my boyfriend started to watch them and that tells something from season to season it got better with the scripts and the stories they have a open mind and by being different from every other show you want to be like them,1
805,richard utter insanity cartoon 'the big is a trip through madness enjoyable backgrounds melting characters and a conclusion that nearly brings me to happy tears everytime i see it br br this short i have seen over and over and over and i never tire of it luckily having it on tape from a broadcast on tv it never stops to make me burst out in laughter uncontrollably and then reach down into the depths of my spirit highlighting the greatness of the human condition br br cause when someone says 'come on let's finish the game' everything is alright in the world and the troubles that we face everyday we suddenly realise are all petty fleeting things not to fight or worry about anymore this film at first seems just like a simple exercise in cartoon slapstick humour but it is far more than that this film hits a greater sense of spiritual meaning with mankind in the wake when everything seems to be so bad and trivial br br it is flawless in every way and damn funny too br br rating 10 out of 10,1
806,wow the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre but still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense br br water has become incredibly rare substance br br well that's strange considering that oxygen or hydrogen is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe and pretty easy to make together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voilà water br br instead of water the rarity of crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb br br the comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced the comedy in the tv series red dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing here instead i felt like saying ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh br br sigh all that money put into sets costumes actors what a waste br br rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it's lameness my recommendations to make it better 1 use a believable plot device 2 get rid of the comedy none of the actors were really any good at it the movie would work better as a serious action adventure br br the obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didn't quite pull it off it's not likely i'll ever watch this again it's too much a total hack job,0
807,i started watching this because i thought it was a really shitty porno as i kept watching the only thrill i got from this movie was finding out what the name of it was so i could look it up and rip on it i just finished it and have considered ending my life knowing that someone actually made this movie br br for the people who commented on this movie as having a good script and great acting my words of wisdom for you are that you probably have no friends because you were in the movie you are probably wishing you had all that time back of your life that you wasted on making this movie br br there is no way that this is a serious movie there was an old guy that gets stabbed and it doesn't even hurt him at all and when everyone else gets stabbed they drop dead br br it was probably important that these people killed random people and ate them and also hung out with an 80 year old man that wanted to put the parts into his body br br my favorite part was when the old man found the or however you spell it because that made the movie seem very intellectual and probably helped to reach the older crowd br br what really blew my mind that they decided to throw in that random scene about the college girls going into the woods looking for fake skulls br br if you do attempt to see this movie you should probably fill up your bathtub and drop your hairdryer in it and be ready to jump in br br this is a must see for anyone who believes there life could not get any worse because this will help you realize there are people out there the makers of this movie who are even more pathetic and are going no where in life,0
808,american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it i graduated from high school in 1962 br br however more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made br br it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate i served 18 months in vietnam with the 101st airborne division br br the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it br br if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong,0
809,this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and i'm not a fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow i recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart,1
810,1959 was a landmark in the world of film several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best just a look at the titles is instructive hitchcock's north by northwest billy wilder's some like it hot howard hawks' rio bravo douglas sirk's imitation of life add a couple from the previous year orson welles' touch of evil hitch's vertigo and nick ray's wind across the everglades and you've got a pretty good summing up of what was possible within the classic hollywood style br br at the same time two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films one was jean luc godard's breathless the other was john cassavetes shadows the two films had certain things in common largely improvised acting by non stars handheld cameras low budgets and a certain youthful jazzy swagger in certain ways though they couldn't be farther apart godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style he knew more about film than most hollywood producers and breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film cassavetes on the other hand was an actor and a refugee from new york's underground theater scene his first film shows him little impressed with the cinema and a big believer in actors godard's film constantly references it's own artifice whereas shadows aims for a certain kind of naturalism br br it doesn't reach it mainly because naturalism is a myth particularly in cinema but it feels powerful kinetic but lilting like the cool jazz on the score certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here it ultimately doesn't hold together mainly because cassavetes' actors here are amateurish beatniks where cassavetes style requires strong imaginative actors his later work with gena rowlands ben gazarra and peter falk blows this out of the water due to the director's technical inexperience some bits of dialogue had to be redubbed later which defeats the freshness of the improvisation still it's fascinating to watch both for the great moments like the scene where leila goldoni talks about her dissapointment with losing her virginity and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way,1
811,i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back i feel it's my duty to get on here myself and say please don't bother watching this movie br br i can't argue with the actors efforts they did what they could given the material but that material is dreadful the pace was deadly slow meandering and you saw everything coming about an hour away and then it took forever to happen the dialogue was boring pointless not funny at all the characters were all completely unsympathetic and the cinematography was in my opinion very low quality the cliché of character uses home video machine was used to very bad effect br br yes jeri ryan is a cool person don't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film,0
812,oz is by far the best show ever to grace television better than the sopranos yes er yes csi absolutely uncompromising daring and utterly disturbing yet profoundly moving oz took us past any image of prison that anyone had ever conjured up on television tom fontana truly did a brilliant job with the writing no topic is taboo rape drugs murder oz is evidence of just how good tv can be it follows characters of all different backgrounds and all different races but always comes back to your everyman tobias in jail for vehicular manslaughter we see what we don't want to see pain death mayhem oz will disturb you make you cringe make you look away but most of all it will make you think to see oz is to see a truly magnificent television production,1
813,only one word can describe mr magoo slapstick unfortunately this isn't no airplane looks can decieve and that's exactly what mr magoo does based on the old cartoon leslie nielson plays magoo a bumbling near blind man stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves now he must hunt them down using blindness basically and that's all this film plays off the blindness of mr magoo now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this but pretty much it's just one of those droopy dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you payed to see this films br br but mr magoo isn't as bad as it's hacked up to be it's at least got some funny jokes and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family nielson tried to make a naked gun for families in magoo but it's no where near as good as that so see it once you might hate it you might love it whatever i personally didn't hate it but i sure didn't like it or even rate it okay 2 5 stars for mr magoo br br john ulmer,0
814,i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection my wife suggested it was one of these 3 for £20 deals at a high street store the thing isn't worth let alone £6 66 having invested heavily in it i felt duty bound to watch it to the end just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through and it was br br the dialog was awful the story line was impenetrable i still don't understand what the hell was going on despite having read the synopsis the camera work was disjointed and hopeless the acting was wooden not helped by the dialogue br br in fact there were no redeeming features no not even the lovely sandra bullock on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap br br as a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex army sidekick while driving this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film no engine noise whatsoever i look forward to the engine technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars,0
815,what on earth happened to rgv there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start first and worst the music every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood quite pathetically i might add secondly the lighting do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working and finally if you are going to the godfather and godfather 2 please realize that a lot of us have seen in was a ripoff of but better done and more entertaining i have seen a similarity in both company and sarkar and while rgv's ab tak 56 was brilliant these two movies leave something to be desired people will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot maybe rgv should see which is good enough to be rgv,0
816,this movie was pathetically awful the sound was terrible the action was ridiculous and the effects were nauseating if you have a life don't see this movie cause you will want to kill yourself this movie totally rips off blade which is undoubtedly a really good movie or trilogy i should say br br i don't care who the actors are this movie is just horrible i watched 10 minutes of it and had to come to my computer and comment on how absolutely just bad this movie is i actually don't know why my family is still watching it oh wait yes i do they are laughing almost non stop at the stupid action dialogue and acting,0

818,as a retired usaf msg aircraft spec this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the fact that a teenager could ever get on the flight line much less get into an f 16 is ludicrous the military spends millions on each pilot to make them the best in the world and this movie makes the air force and all its members seem stupid at best yes i know it is only a movie but it conveys a message to the younger folks that we are all idiots and believe me we are not the logistics involved in setting up any type of mission are highly involved even in the eighties military computers were too secure to hack by any teenager and the other flaws in this movie make peter pan more believable sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all,0
819,i thought it was comedy what a hoot i can't believe forsythe or reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash and then there's the beautiful erika eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called appears she put on a few pounds since her playboy centerfold like about 50 the story line is ludicrous the acting absolutely horrendous and the tired old cliché's that are run over and over and over again boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog the only thing worth it was the laughs and there are plenty if you really want to kill say an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you i think that's who it was written for it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent drug induced audience for this one,0
820,made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge this is a storyline hitchcock would have loved br br sadly hitchcock wasn't around to make it and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller that is held barely together by bullock's intelligence br br it was released in 1995 but is already dated and the amount of mistakes and regarding computers must be seen to be believed and you don't even have to be a dot com person to spot them,0
821,i'm not sure why i disliked this film so much maybe i'm too old or too male or too something just who was the target audience here if you're it and you liked it then i'm happy for you personally i found it a bit of a pill the characters were uninteresting and unlikeable the script was just plain embarrassing and some though not all of the acting was uninspired mawkish tedious and occasionally nauseating surely there's something better on br br on a related issue why is it that whenever i see chris klein in a film i get an urge to slap him silly does anyone else get that,0
822,another awful movie about hockey i if never watched hockey and saw hollywoods version i would hate the game this movie doesn't make canada look that great either i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously all the same this movie is awful with every thing you can put in a 80's movie in the end don't even watch it on tv 4 10,0
823,if you've seen atlantis 1 then you'd know that what made that film truly great was brilliant animation and a good script this movie was so sloppily drawn and animated the story is also dopey i was so disappointed in this half baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour and man did i try the one thing this film had was that it expanded the mole character making him both more sympathetic and three dimensional take it from me judge this junk from the cover on the video box the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent if this was a stand alone flick it wouldn't be so bad but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly,0
824,billy wilder continues his strong run of films during the 1950s with a biopic of charles lindbergh the young american pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the atlantic in 1927 jimmy stewart plays lindbergh and while he might be a bit too old for the part he still brings the sincere warmth and confidence needed as well as his trademark down to earth goodness that makes him an iconic film star wilder directs solidly balancing the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what lindbergh was up against when he decided to take this challenge it certainly isn't his nor stewart's best work but it is a gem of a movie it lifts your spirits with the plane and makes you proud to be an american overall it is just plain good,1
825,i think that mario van peebles movie posse is a very important film it is an excellent entry point film to a side of history many are not aware of this is a story of early black settlers cow boys and infantrymen returning from the spanish american war with a cache of gold the main character peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father the racism applied to the new black settlers and infantryman is explored in this film with excellent casting including melvin van peebles father billy zane stephen baldwin and a wonderful performance by big daddy kane br br one senses that peeples strived to use as many notable black and some not so notable smile actors as possible perhaps too many some notable persons issac hayes pamela grier are only scene in cameo others briefly such as tone loc the sentiment and efforts of peebles efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some the large cast a feat for any director work well and do a good job of telling the story in the classic revenge and fight vs justice western br br most noteworthy was the wonderful narrative role of veteran actor woody strode from once upon a time in the west who's own life was a barrier breaker within the context of a previous era not yet completed faded from memory no other actor could have done this role better read the mini bio on woody strode here as a primer http imdb com name bio br br the film does a good job of balancing action with a bit of sardonic humour the dialog was excellent if a bit contemporary and as others have mentioned the profanity was not accurate to that period the sex scene was a bit much not really needed there are some historical inaccuracies such as the seeming electronic branding of the cattle etc but posse is a good effort to hopefully open the door for more historical and creative works reflective of other untold stories and events the actual photos of real cowboys at the end credits was very nice touch,1
826,flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusually delightful and witty plot twister one of the best american films i have seen this year neil labute's terrific casting and cynical direction keeps this film from becoming too sentimental while renée zellweger and morgan freeman's authentic performances give it a soul violent provocative and humorous at the same time with a truly wonderful ending chris rock greg kinnear aaron crispin glover and allison all give uproarious tongue in cheek performances the greatest spoof of soap operas since the movie soap but better and smarter 9 out of 10,1
827,back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t v executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills in which the evil emporer who looks like he's wearing a home made darth vader costume and his talking bird that looks like a rubber dog chew toy come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's godzilla film fortunately an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video they could also combined into a giant knight forty episodes were made the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film the fights scenes are generic the special effects are poor and some of the sets look like they could fall down the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led,0
828,the hurried approach that lewis takes with king of the underworld establishes a deeper plot while still maintaining an efficient run time one of the clearest examples of this is the transition between poverty and wealth for the married medical couple the audience is instantly transported from a shanty medical office to a luxurious suite at the city's most prestigious inn this development is critical to understanding the position the doctors have been thrown into the story suggests from the intro that these two people are generally happy with providing medical practice to those who are less fortunate by abruptly cutting from this scenario to the morally conflicting occupation the personal physician the viewer is called upon to experience this sudden turn of events the nelsons kay francis and john are forcibly employed by gurney bogart without objections this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture the one aspect of this film that raised some questions for me ironically dealt with the pacing of the story and that rate at which it was told i think that character development and social identity can suffer when certain aspects of a story are not fully examined this paradox happens to be a result of personal taste in that i think that the movie going experience can be enhanced through rigorous character development however for the purposes of this film i must admit that the rapid action contributes more dynamic flare to the impact of the film br br 1 2 of,1

830,writer director brian burns has obviously seen a few romantic comedies and he seems to think that he's discovered the formula for success plenty of location shots in new york preferably in the winter allusions to old hollywood films especially musicals enjoyable musical soundtrack alas all of this is mere compensation for burns' lack of talent as a writer the great mystery of many writer directors making independent films is not why they cannot get on with major studios but how they get any backing at all for their films br br normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the lead characters but the couple in this film simply has no appeal this is not the fault of either david or milla their characters are just poorly written what we respond to in such classics as when harry met sally or annie hall or older films such as his girl friday are quirks and flaws of the lead characters' personalities lacking the ability to create individuals burns gives us an after school special inspired by men are from mars women are from venus br br how anyone can see burns as the successor to woody allen is beyond me i did not laugh once during this film and the screen play is full of echo chamber dialog i want to paint the town red you want to paint the town red which is the most tell tale sign of someone who has no business writing for a living in one of the early scenes we see actress girlfriend filming a mindless tv sitcom it's the only moment in the whole film that the dialog feels right maybe that indicates what burns talents are really suited for,0
831,some changes for the better the special effects are more elaborate some for the worse scott a likable kid in the original has turned into an awkward teenager but generally this sequel is about on a par with the original which doesn't say much the pg 13 rating is questionable although the film is not scary at all there is some brief but quite explicit gore and some out of place nudity 1 2,0
832,dead man walking is a film not about the death penalty but about the people involved in a death penalty case the killer the families whose kids were killed the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor and what happens it tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity i have it on dvd and every time i watch it not often it's never an easy film to watch i'm more impressed by what tim robbins and the entire cast did here so revealing that it could be a documentary so compelling you can't take your eyes away so subtle and yet so powerful dead man walking is nothing short of a masterpiece it doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty or even have no opinion this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure it takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once and everyone involved in the film pulls it off there isn't a single scene that rings false a masterful film but don't expect light viewing to some the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable even though no blood or violence is shown you get drawn into this film and become a participant and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with 10 10,1

840,a tough sell british playwright ronald harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud bellowing film about wwii shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged blustery brilliant but unreliable star at the end of his tether the actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of king lear during an air raid yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation based on the waning years of actor donald whose dresser was ronald harwood this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery chewing thespians unfortunately albert finney at this point in his career not at all elderly seems too robust and quick thinking to play the actor finney and oscar nominated director peter yates cannot modulate moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice and in the next he's curiously falling apart with such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss and his future yet servant tom prods and badgers and finney to carry on rather than rest who played this part on stage and was nominated for an oscar alongside finney for best actor is far more attuned to his role and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film these two thankfully do not peck at each other's heads and scenarist harwood is careful not to fall into a love hate pattern which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act but without a juxtaposition of servant vs celebrity there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism the hint at what once was 1 2 from,0

842,think of an extremely low rent version of heathers and you've got pep squad that sums up the flick in a nutshell i must give credit where credit's due though the film has a nice visual appeal to it i liked the cinematography i liked the wild color schemes i liked the costume designs but without good acting a film has no redeeming value i'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal with good actors and sharp dialogue i e the brothers or any edward burns film the actors either recite their dialogue in or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera this is why i don't badmouth most mainstream actors let's face it most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason if they're not great actors they're at least competent people badmouth leo dicaprio but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page it's a shame because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene sp at the same time i can't totally praise steve the director he did write the screenplay which contains some horrible dialogue he might be slightly racist too since there's a black principal in the movie who inhabits a culmination of african american stereotypes,0
843,i thought it was an excellent movie gary cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously over all i thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line it's sad to say but i think lots of men might feel this way i think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death i thought it was neat that cole's real life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie i think what the guy did was alittle extreme but the movie was great nonetheless definitely recommend it,1

851,it's what you expect it induces laughter cringing and dry heaving not necessarily in that order it's over the top you will see things that you may never be able to erase from your mind's eye jackass number two is better than the first the actors definitely took more risks while filming this movie there are many stunts which could have killed the actors especially johnny knoxville the treatment of animals was suspect but other than that the movie achieved what is was made to achieve if you like the preview see the movie if you don't steer clear br br 8 out of 10,1
852,george segal lives with his elderly and senile mother there are many jokes about her alzheimer's like dementia and most of them aren't funny though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home at first segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy making the film sort of like a wiley coyote versus the roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot too bad this was not the overall tone of the film br br i do applaud carl reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother eating raoul and happiness of the katakuris all films about death that dare to offend the problem here though is that where's poppa has some funny moments but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland plus topics such as homosexual rape incest and the like are really difficult to make funny i read in the rough guide to cult movies that it is considered a cult film though i just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once,0
853,last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going based on a true story it is simply about christina ricci's character and her struggle with depression drugs friends and family as you can probably tell from the title in my opinion this movie moved too fast and it was way too dramatic i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes and the movie moved through her life extremely fast and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci's character christina ricci's performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina ricci i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth they are good and definitely worth checking out,0
854,horses on mars is an engaging animated short that takes a sometimes comical look at the process of evolution through the eyes of those yet to evolve the story is personal and at times sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration that involves the viewer in this science fiction story i was fortunate enough to view this short in widescreen format at the 2002 sundance film festival and must suppose that when transferred to the small screen it will lose some of its ability to draw the reader into the no less thoughtful story and stunning graphics,1
855,no idea how this is rated as high as it is 5 8 at the time of writing but this movie was absolutely horrible the acting wasn't entirely bad but it really had no point whatsoever and the overall quality was poor its obviously a b movie or a c if such a thing exists and it looks like it was made over a weekend at a friends house or something im all for low budget movies and i generally watch any i come across but this one is really really bad i mean like the bad i don't know what else to say but trust in this as i have indeed sat thru this horrible horrible movie and i can save you the effort don't bother seriously just don't,0
856,this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever sat through and that's saying alot because i've seen my share of horrible movies br br but i have never seen a movie in which every single character portrayed was an unintelligent loser seriously there was not one respectable character in the entire script how fitting that the plot was equally lame lacking any intelligence whatsoever br br i can't believe that keanu reeves and cameron diaz would even consent to participating in such stupidity and while i haven't seen all of their other movies i've always enjoyed their performances until now it's not that the acting was bad just the entire story line was moronic,0
857,who are the people that star in this thing never heard of them but this is one of the funniest comedies i have run across it should win the putz prize for parody the absurd starts with dr snorting his powder and turning into a sex fiend he is pursued by libido driven nurse early in the movie in one of the funniest scenes of the movie pay attention to the hospital pa system in the background rather like the system in mash the final scene with hyde accepting the award has had me laughing for years oh and the busty nurse is cassandra peterson who went on to become elvira mistress of the dark br br if you liked the mel brooks classic movies blazing saddles etc i suspect you'd like this one br br damn shame you can't get it on dvd anywhere br br it's available on dvd now good thing dvds don't wear out from use,1
858,bounty killer george hilton smooth mexican bandit gilbert roland who's great and bank representative edd byrnes each try to outwit one another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of train robberies that was hidden by a treacherous member of his gang br br though not the greatest that the genre has to offer it's still breezy enough with a lot of light hearted action filled fun and a satisfying finale br br any gun can play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three outlaws resembling clint eastwood lee van cleef and django br br the next year hilton and roland were reunited alongside van heflin and klaus kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four,1
859,this movie is never going to be on a list of the top 50 films of all time but if you're compiling a list of fun films this isn't a bad place to start liv tyler is amazing captivating and luscious and everyone else is dead on right for their parts it's a 21st century counterpart to tom jones in other words just good bawdy fun i think that this may be tyler's breakthrough film on her way to major stardom with no nudity she oozes sex in this film it's no wonder all the boys give her toys how could they help but do that for a helpless innocent such as liv's jewel,1
860,i don't pretend to be a huge asterix fan having only seen one other movie adaption and read only two of the comics but this was a superb movie all the same i only saw the english version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters brad garret as and sean astin as especially the story itself was both interesting and truly funny especially the contradicting name endings all the viking names end in af while all the names of course end in ix with a little romance thrown in that i though enhanced the story even though it weighed down the overall production with unnecessary clichés br br the plot is this the viking chief is sick and tired of going to raid villages and then finding them emptied so he consults his wise man whose entire repertoire consists of old proverbs and tells him that fear lends the villagers wings taking this literally believes that fear actually allows people to fly and sets out on an expedition to retrieve the champion of fear an expedition that of course leads him to the village where asterix and live br br the pair are currently very frustrated chief cowardly pacifist nephew has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man and the boy is making little to no progress when unwittingly confesses to being afraid of everything in the presence of the brainless viking olaf he is believed to be the champion of fear and is kidnapped asterix and are sent by to go rescue before his father returns to the village to bring his son back home br br ultimately this is a great movie with few flaws besides the clichés and at times defective dialogs i thoroughly enjoyed it despite the fact that it wasn't true to the comic,1
861,this noisy dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast well everyone except william h macy who could have tackled the role played by mr stone the team doctors or the fruitcake selling cereal if you're a fan of the foul mouthed there are some great profanity laden knock down drag out put down phrases you can try out on two faced friends and way ward lovers the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere especially during the first two hours it even features some mtv styled music video scenes br br any given sunday 12 16 99 oliver stone al pacino cameron diaz jamie foxx dennis quaid,0
862,many american pea brains who worship and support the political half truths of hucksters like michael moore would do well to sit through this movie more than once and see how hypnotic can scare intimidate and lie to an public and get the people they fear or loathe killed and mutilated robespierre in this fine epic kills the opposition by remote control all in a fit of self righteous devotion to his principles we get the impression that robes felt it quite justifiable to snip off his heads even as he sent his minions out to trump up false and misleading charges against the state today the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive that robes they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources witness dan attempts to assassinate w's character on the eve of the 2004 election or the constant drumbeat that the 2000 election was stolen although constitutional scholars continue to scoff at such irresponsible drivel,1
863,well i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo just the final 10 minutes or so but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film i'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport and i've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before however nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie it literally defies belief the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport and they are elegant and graceful the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman and her highly trained male supporters are no better well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy overweight people many of whom are walking i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they're staggering along on two broken legs are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race maybe the director just thinks that female runners can't run faster than 12 minute miles and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or br br even if you aren't a running fan you'll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy here is a note to the director the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action,0
864,following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one this incredibly dull slow and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the bat hammy luis is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the aztec mummy the bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal flatly directed by rafael with a talky and tedious script by alfredo salazar and guillermo calderon cruddy continuity for example the bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film but is miraculously alive and well here an excruciatingly sluggish script an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks a meandering narrative a crippling lack of action and momentum largely dreary going through the motions non acting from an understandably disinterested cast and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom this numbingly dry drippy and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout,0
865,nice to see a comedy for grown ups masterfully structured by aaron via mike own mastery mr mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in who's afraid of virginia woolf to the sad and riveting julia roberts clive owen jude law and natalie portman in closer in charlie wilson's war the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks julia roberts philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else it's personal only to a point hanks has to bury his brilliance in single and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant amy adams witnesses and exist as a character witnessing an insurmountable task that miss adams manages to surmount beautifully it is philip seymour hoffman's gus with a t however that monopolized my attention his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together hoffman is superb the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions a sharp short smart sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that,1
866,i've seen this movie twice already and am very impressed with it br br the conversations between and her mother plus and matthew are very touching the community is shown very truthfully and as as it usually is br br although certain things could have done with a bit more explanation if we knew why matthew was in the south of france in the first place the scenes following matthew being found in his car would be more understandable br br luckily optimum releasing have a website that has detailed production notes that help to make such scenes better to understand br br i would go and see it again but unfortunately it had a limited release in london and is not longer available to see i hope the video release gets it to a bigger audience because the film deserves it,1
867,i like noel coward the wit i like noel coward the play write i like noel coward the composer and singer but i loathe noel coward the actor br br to me this is a man who should have stayed firmly behind the scenes writing his plays and composing his music and making his profound and hilarious observations he should never have been allowed in front of a camera br br make no mistake he is one of the top outstanding talents of the 20th century but the man just couldn't act and his voice with it's rolling r's and it's overly round tonal quality well it could quite easily grate cheese in my opinion br br this is one of my least favourite offerings from coward as he unconvincingly portrays a psychiatrist embarking on an affair with a much younger woman made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife br br celia johnson is as much a joy to watch as ever as cowards wronged wife it is her performance that saves this film from abject dullness i suppose her own little fling in coward's brief encounter four years previously qualified her for this role as she must have raised a few eyebrows playing a such a promiscuous woman and this gave her the chance to win back a few fans and gain some lost sympathy br br she was such a wonderful actress and you can see why noel coward used her so much in many of his productions br br however the rest of the film is drab badly acted predictable and on the whole boring to almost arse clenching level br br if its noel coward you want then take the time to watch in which we serve blythe spirit or this happy breed instead three noel coward treasures with lovely films like these i suppose we can forgive him for this turkey br br i have given this four stars purely for the addition of miss johnson but on the whole i'd avoid this one like the plague,0
868,the show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs people frown upon the show due to its perverted idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization but truth be told practically every young guy is out doing it at the club overall the show really appeals to the younger population as we like to see the outcome of a player's performance at the club as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel br br 10 10 a cool fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact good job boys,1
869,i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd despite being a 'tv movie' and shot on 16mm it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a 'london along with their foibles and family commitments even the most hapless of candidates 'titanic' with his uncommunicative wife it was possible to see how jack was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining 90 minutes br br originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford pun intended the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael nigel hawthorne jonathan lynn lesley joseph and maureen lipman mrs meant mick may have had top billing but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents br br even 15 years after its 1991 release it is still as fresh as ever,1

872,did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends wow this is so cool we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems well this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching sam raimi's the evil dead or a similar independent horror classic this demon summer however is so bad it's embarrassing these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesn't make them talented i've seen quite a lot lousy b movies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made and it's quite sad to be this open hearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions there's pretty much no script at all a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some passages of it one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager groups dorks hot catholic girls stoners and troublemakers that's about it except of course for all the obligatory clichés like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry they just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact i hate that some of make up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk songs ever this film should never have been released i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element not even a bit of amateur nudity damned,0
873,i don't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment the eye popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated me and my girlfriend just watched it together and i'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again i'm not sure what was worse the scrawny unattractive cast their supremely genitals the rancid attempts at humor the screeching noises that claimed to be songs br br no i know what was worst of all the girls in the green leotards with green licking alice to dry her off then proposing in broken childlike speech that they suckle milk from her breasts that was the worst br br also what was with the nurses and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas why are all the male actors gay why does humpty dumpty a dildo in the air and pretend that it's his penis why did my eyes have to see this there are no words,0
874,this harold lloyd short wasn't really much not one of his funnier efforts of course i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious that's what the bulk of this story is harold and his wife mildred davis babysitting his in laws two young kids one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four year old terror who does everything but demolish the house letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me br br the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon noah young is burglarizing their house half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple but overall that segment is fun with some good sight gags reminding me of another lloyd short haunted spooks br br however the good ending doesn't save the whole picture which i probably wouldn't watch again lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again it just isn't that funny,0
875,i wanted to dog this movie but somehow i can't find it in myself to do that br br exhibiting a duality of fighting styles it's li vs li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy br br this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances li's acting is extremely amateurish hesitant and stiff for most of this movie right up to the very end at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters you know to show a difference in personalities but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent it did get a bit better more relaxed toward the end but that wasn't enough to save his performance jet li's acting does improve as his career moves forward i don't hate his acting i just hated him in this br br i also have to say that the effects were very b class effects what effects there are br br the story itself had great potential it was uniquely creative daring and fresh unfortunately either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting effects film quality and some acting lessons or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details he also did not bother with the science in the science fiction a fact which was a great detractor to this film br br the fight sequences were a bit one sided as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt br br as enjoyable as this was i couldn't help but think all the way through that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it should've been rather than what it is br br it rates a 6 0 10 on the b scale br br that's a 4 2 10 on the a scale for having a good plot from br br the fiend,0
876,the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant ivory film are all here but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor sally hemmings has barely a role to play in the proceedings there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes in fact gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic her role as thomas daughter martha is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is one moment she is slapping a slave and another moment she's the whole system of slavery nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits very disappointing all in all,0

878,the first two movies of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage which i understand is part of the point but it really makes the entire video component of the film seem like random images stuck together ones and zeroes flying around computer models of human skeletons and so forth occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect the nationalism finance segment around 35 00 but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content and demands you accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director it's no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack,0
879,sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a looney tunes featurette than a grisly giallo don't torture a duckling 1972 is nonetheless a grade a thriller from horror maestro lucio fulci in this one someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural southern italian village and typical for these gialli there are many suspects there's barbara bouchet patrizia looking more than you've ever seen her a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal florinda bolkan the local epileptic voodoo woman her witchcraft practicing beau giuseppe the local idiot the sweet faced priest his dour mother and on and on the film features some unusually violent set pieces including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard one of the most realistically bloody sequences that i've ever seen and a nifty when the killer is ultimately revealed the film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of still this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural backdrop unsettling child murders oddball characters and freaky score by riz ortolani the film has been beautifully photographed in what i presume to be monte near the adriatic in southern italy at least that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits and while subtitling would've made this fine looking dvd work even better the american slang doesn't convince in this rural italian setting anchor bay is to be thanked for another job well done oh that title does eventually make perfect sense too,1

881,large corporations vs conscientious do good ers we seem to witness events both real life and reel life of this sort all the time and most of the time greed wins by employing every means dirty necessary and the truth gets suppressed at least in this movie jack jack lemmon got his points across and paid for it dearly we have seen several more movies of this sort being made in the recent years the most memorable of which was 'the where russell crowe played a tobacco industry scientist who tried to blow the whistle claiming that the industry added more nicotine in cigarettes to make smokers addicted there was also this reporter protagonist angle where the reporter is looking for the scoop of his her dreams and the protagonist is faced with this moral dilemma where he she has to choose between righteousness and his livelihood and sometimes his her life br br jane fonda played reporter kimberly wells to perfection she plays a reporter who wishes to pursue serious news whereas her bosses value her more as an 'eye candy' she and her crew the cameraman played by post michael douglas who is also the producer of the movie witness an accident in a nuclear power plant while they were on a visit cameraman michael douglas sneakily illegally gets footage of that event on tape in spite being a no photography zone and smuggles it out of the station the station refuses to air it and informs the corporation that owns the nuclear station br br in the mean time the chief engineer jack launches an investigation of his own and discovers a lot of irregularities in the equipment that's being used for the reactor this starts all the dirty politics of corruption and greed br br this is a good thriller and it managed to create a lot of tension in the audience till the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to suggest all the scary moments now that's great and unusual in movies performances were all good and i love jack lemmon we primarily know him for his comedic roles but he is equally good in dramatic roles i give this movie an 8 10,1
882,i watched this series after i had seen the naked gun films i found it much better than the films and i thought the films were great this series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun sight gag or funny situation the all night wicker place club flamingo i don't think i've ever laughed as hard at a tv series in my life even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes i think its a shame that only six episodes were produced but i agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes overall the series is a must see for those who like puns bad jokes and slapstick sight gags,1
883,leslie excellent book on the tells the whole story of the fleischer's big move of their entire animation unit to florida and their subsequent ejection by paramount br br mr bug goes to town didn't destroy the animation credit with paramount although it's often told that way and this was paramount's favorite version of the story according to the big studio more than anything wanted to get their mitts on the animation studio and ease the famously bickering brothers out of the picture altogether mr bug provided them the pretext to do just that the sad closing of a great quirky innovative chapter in american animation br br i wanted to comment also that the film actually debuted december 4 1941 not december 7 that may have been close enough to do the trick anyway in terms of national mood damaging the film's success but another part of the legend of this troubled little film is that it was killed by having the bad luck to be in the theaters at the same time dumbo released october 23 1941 was still doing very brisk holiday business i haven't done the research into box office numbers but i'd say that concurrent presence in theaters likely had an impact on mr bug movie going was at an all time high at this period and successful films could go strong in theaters for months something unimaginable in these typically short run quick to dvd days,1
884,deepa mehta's fire is groundbreaking bold and artistic a masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative upper middle class indian households this is a film no one should miss shabana azmi and nandita das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible a r music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film mehta uses score and together they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around radha and sita whenever they look to each other for support this film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it lesbianism is just a part of the film it is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning,1
885,we've seen a story like this before a wife in marital troubles played by nastassja kinski engages in sex with a stranger william baldwin and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job everything seems bright however kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants what to do say nothing br br i didn't really like the movie while it wasn't just bad it clearly lacked that something maybe it should've focused more on what's going inside kinski's head nothing to say about the actors themselves i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films finally the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot br br in my opinion the movie tried to look cool it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there some stills fast cuts and glamour but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better same goes for the music otherwise it didn't look that bad br br some might like this but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea to be fair i don't usually watch much this type of thrillers this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long i think it could've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes especially the shower scene br br my advice try before you buy,0
886,i had great expectations surrounding this movie not as it was an apocalypse now or an 8 1 2 but high enough and when i saw it on cable they were all shattered starting by the acting poor almost mediocre an astonishing waste of good actors and talent and the story itself since when does a 5 men squad go out on patrol on a supposed zone to suicide that´s one big mistake that costs the film dearly very good actors do very poor acting here like sean penn that recently repeated the irritating way of talking on am and michael j fox that wastes a good opportunity to beat charlie sheen on performing just but the most irritating character was diaz played by john leguizamo another stupid waste of fine talent by the director that was a cheesy scared and insecure kind of person even more irritating that jar jar binks yes you heard it the battle sequences are average the only one that really stands out is the opening sequence with michael j fox trapped by his feet on a vc tunnel mr de palma has a weak work here and if it wasn´t for films like and «the these ones excellent films i would consider him a director too much publicity bad filming br br 3 10,0

888,i saw this play on showtime some years back in the comfort of my home and when the final note was struck i wanted to jump off the sofa and give the production a standing ovation as it was i shed a tear that it was such a bunch of fantastic performances and songs for my birthday my kids bought me the vhs version as well as the cd of the play with len in the sweeny todd role br br i've shared the play with many some finding the subject a bit sick but none having anything but praise for the songs br br i've always loved the interplay in songs with angela lansbury and george as well as and edmund as judge turpin br br i must own the dvd,1
889,this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it br br there are good class b movies and i do not reject the genre when they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality almost nothing is true in the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics just a cliche the effects are cheap and i do not care that the film is low budget you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films you do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not the only quality i could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film br br 2 10 on my personal scale the worst film of the year so far,0
890,i watched this movie the night it premiered on mtv usually to me mtv movies are kind of stupid but this one was so good summer phoenix is an amazing actress and i thought that nick stahl was good too if mtv started showing more movies like this i would probably enjoy the channel a lot more,1
891,i own all family guy seasons so far and i have to say vol 6 has been the biggest disappoint of them all there are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think vol 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs at least for me br br the biggest annoyance i had with vol 6 is it seems to be very heavy in left wing politics i'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this volume really seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show insinuated all conservative are horrible places insinuating we need more gun control insinuated school are under funded insinuated religious people are crazy bush is friends with the devil i could go on and this is just from the first three episodes br br sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just shoving your political views on other people,1
892,japan takes the best from around the world and makes it their own while that may be true it applies to all except for one thing that being major league baseball but not to worry mr baseball is there to try and change all that but just who will change whom is the part of the movie that really makes it rock tom selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines on in his comedic roles the storyline may be true to life however the subplot is dead on the japanese people are a gentle respectful people with ways and traditions very different than those of western society all of these elements and obstacles combine to make for one truly enjoyable funny film it's definitely worth the watch,1
893,this was a very gritty movie about anti semitism however unlike gentlemen's agreement that also deals with anti semitism the movie has aged well and doesn't seem heavy handed in other words it deals with the topic without seeming preachy or trite by today's standards br br robert ryan plays one of the most vile characters as he beats a guy to death just because he's jewish robert mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime br br i give the movie kudos for its gritty and unflinching look at hate it is in many ways an example of film noir even though the topic isn't about the usual gangsters or robbery,1
894,this movie blew me away i have only seen two episodes of the show never saw the first movie but went to a pre screening where johnny knoxville himself introduced the movie telling us to off our sense of moral judgment for an hour and a half ' he was right as a movie this would probably rate a 2 given it has zero plot no structure besides randomness and very little production value however that isn't the point everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through not only were some of the stunts creative see trailer if you need to know but they hid some of the best or worst depending on how you want to look at it but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise these guys do some stuff that won't make it into your newspaper reviews and probably can't even be published here involving lots of things below the belt however almost 3 4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical even if morally but remember statement and if you are in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch only about 20 minutes of this movie could have actually been shown on tv so consider yourself warned of what you're getting into some stuff is disgusting but instead of being repulsed by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all as a person who thought jackass the tv show was an over hyped fad with only a few funny sketches and lots of unnecessary pain the amount of fun i had at this movie has made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work in it's a lot of fun and should be a great comedic fix until the borat movie comes out with this movie you may think you know what you're getting but these guys are a few steps ahead of you i guarantee you'll be surprised by the 3rd sketch so enjoy and don't worry you won't want to perform almost any of their stuff at home,1
895,it is hard to put the devastating beauty of to words partly because i am still grasping to comprehend it myself several hours after my second viewing first it must be said that contains some of the most incomparably and unforgettably haunting scenes i have seen in a film or television production the acting is excellent particularly that of bill paterson as a british minister grappling with his heroin addicted daughter and an aid deal to pakistan that hinges on drug issues another plot line describes these drug issues at a ground level in pakistan and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler the third main storyline involves the prosecution of a hamburg drug and the conflicting efforts of his wife and two german detectives while he is under trial it is a profound accomplishment that the interaction between these stories feels natural transcending the forced plot entanglement often found in hollywood movies it is an even greater accomplishment that a work spread over three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and enthralling without having to oversimplify it is devastating bleak and brutal but never apathetic in short is a rare work of film that handles challenging subjects with unmatched compassion and clarity,1
896,abe zwick perfected the one off beautifully he never made another film but created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self hatred in this film that is both caustic and affecting he commands the screen presenting the crumbling debris of a man breaking down under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life br br paul zwick is an aging queen who's somehow convinced stanley wayne crawford a doe eyed idiot with no sense of the future to follow his star he's a petty thief who's seething hatred has escalated recently he's been forced to skip town and move to a suburb in miami as a disguise he dresses up like a dried up old blue stocking with as much seething sexual torment as the church lady he tells stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his aunt martha paul himself has no friends spends far too much time alone in the house and has to deal with stanley's dissolute lifestyle it would be enough to make any man cross the line into homicidal mania br br again zwick portrays paul as a tragic figure who has utterly lost any understanding of how to relate to other people nevertheless there is a certain poetry in his anguish which burns slowly over the course of the film he's tragic but also elegant this is ultimately a very sad film it certainly has many hilarious moments but there is such an undercurrent of hopelessness and despair that the humour is bittersweet this film is worth watching for the performance of abe zwick he could have really built his career on martha she's quite a gas once you get to know her just make sure you cut your hair and stop your horsing around she really hates that,1
897,the great yul brynner who won an and who has starred blockbusters such as 'the ten among lots of others ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one and such indeed one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen james coburn charles bronson eli wallach in 'the magnificent and walked around under the famous elmer bernstein soundtrack it's difficult to make a living out of being an actor sometimes,0
898,superb editing outstanding acting especially by and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack this film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady br br the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate new york town the audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director br br soon to be shown on hbo feb 7 i believe fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story,1
899,i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie it is like watching home movies with a twist i recomend this to everyone highly,1
900,mr bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour it is the most shallow humour tv series ever made in history the scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine mr bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is it is incredible that such a tv series of low quality can be sustained for 5 years it is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can't help but to express disgust and pity why rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2 dimensional unfunny and ridiculous character or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode watching this is an aggravating experience,0
901,rigoletto is verdi's masterpiece full of drama emotion and powerful memorable music the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but gilda as a horny ditz opera certainly can be adapted to cinema look at magnificent la traviata but when a work is as superb as rigoletto it doesn't need cheap gimmicks it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that,0
902,i think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and i saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen we decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great but we were in for a pleasant surprise the movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times the music was wonderful and dev anand as a city bred looked and acted his best i still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over br br whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time no he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons one is homely one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help dev in his career as a poet the question is which one is the for him what makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too when things come to an impasse a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision br br this dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black n white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today if you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact in case you watch this movie without this part and get confused don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie,1
903,okay so i love silly movies if you enjoy silly sci fi movies over the top movies or if you are a fan of mr bruce campbell i would go see this movie this movie is all that i wanted it to be being a fan of over the top movies this fit the bill every time i thought to myself this movie would be the best movie ever if blank would happen then just as i thought it blank would happen it's a wonderful silly 'b' movie if you are a fan of campbell i'd say 'see it' bring your friends laugh at it it's fun it's not classic or anything but if it's on tv some night watch it it has become for me a movie i would file under indulgent movies movies that may not be good but after a hard day of work i could come home and watch this list also includes and kumar go to white castle' of and ' intolerable br br if you feel like a over the top wonderfully slightly bad movie watch this if not go rent bubba ho tep,1
904,saw this movie at a saturday matinée with a friend theater was about 70 full br br although there are quite a few funny lines it is more of a drama suspense with humor sprinkled on top robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney being a daily show fan lewis black is pretty good in this christopher walken gives a good performance also br br the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie suspense in a supposed comedy movie i know that i as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater br br in all fairness after the movie was over there was smattering of applause so definitely some people enjoyed this movie br br i gave this movie a four out of ten because i believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense drama movie and the actors performances while not bad were just decent br br again this movie isn't what was advertised,0
905,night of the demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good low budget can be sure much of it is fairly predictable but somehow it's still much more enjoyable than the crap we see these days being passed off as horror i give the gore a solid 9 and the one liners are actually funny i'm still creeped out by stop looking at me the soundtrack is well done i was surprised to hear stigmata martyr from bauhaus there is also some very nice t a on display as well as some hella good make up effects the second film in the series is pretty good too but avoid the inferior third one night of the demons may be dated dark and low rent but it still has a lot of potential it's definitely worth a rental at least give it a chance tonight just stay away from any old makeup you'll understand when you see it,1
906,first i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional usually corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film without him and the character he played the film would have been a lot worse hardly a 2 or 3 br br so why did i hate the rest of the film so much well one of my pet peeves is when characters act too stupid to live you can't base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid unless having a brain injury is part of the plot of course but this is exactly what happens in this film wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph wife so what do they do yep they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably won't stop this madman and if this isn't bad enough the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be is anyone that stupid i hate when movies have such dumb characters in fact i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors in addition to these clichéd characters there was also a bit player who fainted sure seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint however in real life this is a rare occurrence people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason so combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism something film noir movies must have br br all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell corey's character is amazingly well written and conceived it was his chance to shine as an actor too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk this is one film that could really use a remake but this time without brainless characters,0
907,i can't give it less than a star i tried at this moment im not sure if im halfway through it or not but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream or not or maybe it was i think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include the descriptions horrible or awful or made me want to swallow a bullet are probably being nice because it is an indie film don't listen to them listen to me there is no nudity in the movie skip it i needed ten lines to submit this warning so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as hot is fat she has fat elephant legs,0
908,even the trailer for this movie makes me cry like the first time i saw this movie not for people who are easily upset by intense material the finest performances by alan rickman and stowe without a doubt this dreadful tale of a society with the power to kidnap and torture it's citizens for any reason whether they are or the writer of children's books will chill you to the bone i saw it when it first came out 1991 and i remember every frame it still scares the hell out me today it's happening now br br apparently imdb requires ten lines to meet their criteria for a film review imdb might want to get a grip some of us are a little more succinct about writing opinions,1
909,spawned by the same monty berman dennis spooner partnership which produced the champions and randall hopkirk deceased the latter retitled my partner the ghost for the us market department s remains a classic example of the action adventure series which the uk produced in bulk during the late 1960s like those two shows its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality dept s also has a black superior but it's mostly facade the launch episode six days is barely halfway through before rosemary nichols is called upon to parade around in bra panties and one yes one stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation still it's an interesting time capsule even if the appalling fashion sense of peter character which amazingly degenerated even further in the spin off series jason king should definitely have remained buried,1
910,in 1961 this series was shown on local tv here in southern california i and many others have been petering bbc for tape or dvd ever since now all of a sudden here it is on amazon i pre ordered in january and now here on march 30 it arrived it was a long wait 48 years was it worth it so far i have just watched richard ii i've only had the dvd since 2 o'clock and i can truly say yea totally worth the wait the acting direction and production are superb and even better than i remember the production is in b w but somehow it fits the video is clear and very good the sound is flawless further proof of how timeless shakespeare truly is br br i gave this 10 stars even though i have only seen 1 of the 8 plays i am sure that when i have seen them all i will change my rating to at least a 12 br br it's currently in stock at amazon us region 1 at a reasonable price br br i'd better stop now so i can get back to watching next up is henry the iv part 1 of which is my all time favorite shakespeare play,1
911,this is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the 1970s everglades it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half there is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing i don't know it is mesmerizing i was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule there are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldn't take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why,1
912,i loved that the mood was light and airy i loved that the lead character wanted guarantees about his future and that his roommate sets him straight of all people i loved that they tackled the dynamics of how the members in the men's group dealt with each other considering this was directed by a lesbian the whole theme of masculinity was put out there ridiculed dissected and questioned what makes a man what makes one straight gay or bisexual you aren't really sure if our lead character has decided on who he really wants he's living in the moment and thrown caution to the wind these and other reasons make me love this film,1
913,i happen to love this show its a refreshing take on some older sci fi feels and styles they aren't afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die far too many show's are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters they all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their to make the mini series from beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time worth a watch even if you don't have the time,1
914,ok i have seen gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake its really gory and gross not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner yeah take my wife please the are real sexy for 1972 i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie stripped to kill in 1987 i did enjoy the earlier h g lewis flick 100 maniacs which was a mini masterpiece of sorts but bad acting no awards here but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th and saw in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer ugh morbid stuff here h g lewis strikes again 2 out of 10,0
915,this could have been so much better than it turned out tom pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with but it just doesn't work br br first the actors are much too old to play high school students especially howard vince he looks about thirty second it's hard to sympathize with poor marv especially since betty is not all that hot to start with br br spoilers the ending is so strange it looks like the director intended for character to get shot but there are no gunshots he's just knocked to the cement where he lays there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher face down what were his injuries a skinned knee goofy vince has just shot his girlfriend dead without any remorse whatsoever yet he simply shoves marv to the ground and rushes off despite the fact that he makes no secret of the fact that he hates the kid and to make matters even sillier marv begs the police to tell his father he's sorry duh hey marv you just got knocked around i think you will have plenty of opportunities to tell your father you're sorry in person and this writer didn't get an oscar nomination skip it unless you get to watch it on mst,0
916,this is awful you just could't believe it the score is annoying the filming is bad for example sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appearing on some actors faces the quality of the movie is ultra bad seems like it was made in the it's terrible there is a bit of blood in the beginning and through the movie but always too dark filmed no gore no effects the director made some better one like blood rites but out there there is a following of the man 'cause searching to find this cheap flick isn't that hard but you have to pay hard earned cash for it surely this will get in my top ten of worst horrormovies ever i don't know if i would call it horror there is too much talking you will get bloodthirsty after watching it,0

918,is an interesting film i personally love the dogma movement i wish it had lasted longer it seems to have already died many critics tried their to shut it down i don't know why it's the most interesting movement to happen in the cinematic world since the french new wave besides i've seen the first three in the series idioterne and mifune they were all great being a masterpiece in my opinion isn't up to those others i was just fascinated with the filmmaking it's played as if it were a real documentary with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down at a few points in the film it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction but that illusion was protracted for an amazing amount of time i wish that the filmmakers would have come up with something a bit more interesting to put onscreen it is basically about this guy fabian who is an argentinian visiting the islands were only in the last couple of months allowed onto the islands and fabian plans to impregnate the women with argentinian children he sets his eyes on one and most of the movie is spent on her seduction the two actors are very natural camilla only kind of hints that she is an actress fabian seems completely real the politics of the film are somewhat confusing to me since i have only an inkling of the situation surrounding the island and its recent history i was 3 i think when the were invaded the final bit of the film doesn't work at all i don't get what the filmmakers were going for there still is an interesting dogma experiment it does break some dogma rules though notably the no extra diagetic music rule there is a lot of that 7 10,1
919,i love exotic science fiction fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch suggestions and images of child abuse mutilated bodies live or dead other gruesome scenes plot holes boring acting made this a experience the basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or tv an outer limits episode was better at exploring this idea i gave it 4 10 since some special effects were nice,0

921,this much anticipated dvd memento of rush's visit to south america in 2002 is possibly the finest rock video ever set down on disc the picture and sound production values are amazing even more so as they constantly battled the elements to bring this production off all the tracks you would expect from the rush catalogue are here from tom sawyer to the pass gloriously reproduced for the frankly brazilian crowd they actually to which is an instrumental and gives you an indication of their fervour the first disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi angle set pieces la villa and the awesome drum solo plus a 30 minute documentary about the bands visit to brazil all in all this is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans should own a copy,1
922,i absolutely love this show its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9 it's political irrational and irresistible anyone who says they don't like it is lying there is a character for every one peter quagmire are my favorites peter because he is rude obnoxious and just doesn't give a crap because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it and quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes also there is an episode for everybody too if you're the political type there is mr griffin goes to washington vol 2 season 3 if you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible vol 2 season 3 or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit janet vol 1 season2 basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone,1

924,this movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole a poorly made peg a peg so cheap it couldn't even be produced in a assembly line in chinatown mexico in fact when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed it crumbles into sticky disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off is such a peg br br this movie is so mind bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature some freakish entity that in the corner of a dank office somewhere and and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at only science would be interested in such a thing anyone not bent on studying it would exhume it from this world br br what it comes down to is this if you're the kind to enjoy first year violin recitals racism or coke zero it might just be your birthday,0
925,the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg blonde venus is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer the plodding storyline of dietrich being torn between two men becoming a mammoth cabaret star and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half baked together dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers while herbert marshal is unconvincing as her ill tempered husband and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture the film does contain some intriguing set pieces the hot voodoo number is the high point that are impressively surrealistic for this era in hollywood although it proves to no avail in such a dull incoherent film,0
926,it was a terrific movie i like to watch it again and again the actors were awesome the movie kept me on the edge of my seat i would recommend this movie to anyone i wish lifetime would put this movie on dvd i would most definitely purchase a copy this movie just proves that you should be very careful about who you get hooked up with you may think you know someone but you never know my daughter watched the movie with me she thought it was great all i know is i will watch this movie every time lifetime airs it it's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to the t v i wish lifetime would redo the movie but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen,1
927,i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent it has it's moments i guess you would say some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic i won't be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre the action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting 7 out of ten,1
928,one of my desires is to be a film maker and i just have to say there's no way i will be able to compete with the powerful drama the war at home the reason is because the acting is perfect and when you see the movie you'll know what i'm talking about all i can suggest is watching it i got so involved in it and was extremely impressed br br and sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing br br and so was his relationship with his mother kathy bates some of the best scenes include these 2 br br as well as the relationship between sheen and his daughter sister in the film br br 10 10 and definitely in my top 10 i want the dvd,1
929,at first i couldn't tell if it was an art film or a documentary the day after i had a unique movie after taste experience or perhaps a revelation the film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists including life on earth the lead is clueless and cold he is like all of us he wants to get rich to laugh to travel to eat and be entertained he moves from one place to another in a giant rv without direction or motive only to pass time and entertain himself by the end it's too late since my first viewing of usa it had grown on me like a custom fit dream where life on earth is nothing but a weird experience i am an artist and a buddhist and this film communicated to my senses it was an ideal embodiment of impermanence this may sound strange but somehow this film was able to touch me in a profound way like no other i recommend it,1
930,i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable but i was so wrong aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress every one who i no who watched it loved it br br the music in it was also really good br br the my favourite lines from the film is you cant send me to a public school mom im a and take your time it'l come to you br br although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do this film is great and a proper good chick flick that i can watch over and over again,1
931,i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible and nothing else really matters br br don't get me wrong i like pretty actresses and sex scenes and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits but this director does nothing else right br br for example take the scene where the two cops of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them are talking over while standing over the first dead body the camera pans between them for each line there's more than one screen width between them and you end up wondering whether you're seasick from that or the clueless dialog br br well it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes but i wouldn't know i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do,0
932,1st watched 7 29 2001 4 out of 10 dir mark fast paced frantic animation effort by ted turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king don't let this fool you there is no comparison in story or quality,0
933,this film is absolute cinematic genius it has a well brought together cast who give an almost magical performance the effects are nothing but stunning and the story will keep you hanging off your chair right the way through the movie jack long plays the part of abbot white exceptionally well he provides an immensely thrilling portrayal of absolute evil if your a kung fu fan or just an action movie enthusiast this film is an excellent choice for anyone who is lucky enough to find a copy for any big kung fu fans this movie provides a compelling insight into the world of shaolin this film is definitely 10 10 quality and should be considered as one of the greatest eastern movies of all time,1
934,this movie is proof you can't just go to a and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try br br while i'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway decent special effects on such a low budget and at least a halfway decent script and story line unfortunately it was only just that halfway decent br br if you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up and don't mind low budget effects you might like this film honestly it wasn't really my cup of tea i should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching br br for a better science fiction movie produced on an even lower budget have a look at primer,0
935,ok i for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film plus with the cast line up i was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books however i got annoyed half hour into the story just where normal films get good this film hit rock bottom br br spoiler the guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks not only that he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths br br but in the end he is happy because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire this film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick ruined a good story shame really,0
936,maverick director seijun suzuki finally was able to film his dream project princess raccoon and in a way it's lucky he didn't try this in the 1960's special effects and computer graphics certain made this sort of production easier to achieve than the old film matte technology would have br br some familiarity with japanese history and theatrical traditions will help with the enjoyment of this film much as familiarity with shakespeare's the tempest would help with peter greenaway's dense prospero's books these two films actually have a bit in common although princess raccoon is much more colorful and easier to watch for someone without the background to fully appreciate it br br while the art design acting and direction are fine for most of the film it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the last third of the film most of the interesting sets have been already been introduced and the camera seems to step back for more of a filmed stage play experience br br this is certainly a unique film experience and i recommend it to anyone who is interested in alternate forms of film performance it's not really meant for children although nothing happens that would upset them if the last third was better i would have given it nine stars,1
937,honestly i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating this dumb salman khan govinda feature is one of those stupid films okay by now we've all seen starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true then why would we need to see salman khan re enact this therein lies the 64 000 question in case you were wondering govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life an unreachable socialite played by katrina kaif br br lara dutta is along to play eva mendes and real life love kaif pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far no stretch no acting required and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films rajpal yadav co stars f,0
938,river's edge is not a pleasant film to watch but it is an incredible one having viewed it many years ago i truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something perhaps no movie ever made has captured the of young suburban inertia like this frightening movie given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing very well acted and just unpleasant at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all fantastic,1
939,central airport is the story of a pilot named jim richard who has one bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up commercial flying he meets a beautiful girl named jill sally and the two start up an act involving flying and stunts the two start a relationship but when jim is hurt his brother tom brown takes over the act for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend from there things get exciting and terribly terribly sad br br this film is a pre code because of several reasons first jim and jill have consummated their relationship without being married and with no intention of having a wedding second is shown in her underwear and absolutely restricted scene when the production code came into effect br br this film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and in consequence ends bittersweetly,1
940,very curious that nichols and hanks would team up for this obviously they believe it strange because it should carry the title charlie wilson's war the lie br br how could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding afganistan of the russians the cia was providing support for the taliban and today's world of terrorism in 1990 bin laden went home to saudi arabia as a hero of jihad who along with his arab legion had brought down the mighty superpower of the soviet union in afghanistan br br to avoid any connection to osama bin laden is to say again hollywood cares little for historical truth charlie wilson a patriot hardly more like a congressman gone amok,0
941,co directed by and starring rutger hauer this film short was based on a short story by dutch writer harry br br in the 10 minutes of the film's length you will get to see a life time as 'harry' unravels his long time fascination with a room he passes constantly in his youth returning to the city many years later he finds he has rented the same room br br using black and white film the textures are accentuated in this delicate telling of a tale the voice of 'harry' drawing you into his world br br a subtle tight performance from rutger hauer and 2 non speaking characters wonderful soundtrack by dutch musician br br at the moment difficult to see this movie as it is only available on dvd region 2 liv ullman as a bonus track but is due to be on the re released dvd of the hitcher another tight but very different performance from hauer br br see this film if you can,1
942,this home movie is basically scandalously rubbish but you have to give them 3 10 for trying the blood is rubbish but the granny that kills them is quite funny and i think the concept is good and make up is ok for a home movie however thank god it was only 55 minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally fight club as in almost as trash as the film just read this comment don't watch the film,0
943,somehow this film burrowed it's way into the soft spot of my heart don't ask me how it happened but i suppose having the film feature ed i'll sponsor anything mcmahon as a tail chasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it br br frankly i was disappointed with first outing in 1972 nothing more than a quick throw together to follow shaft mania how does the sequel get away from this big jim brown seems stronger as slaughter here than in the first perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from instead of his simple be like shaft motivation before br br the most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp daddy number one james brown almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the godfather an excellent period film for the music wardrobe vehicles lingo and hair i should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when jim brown and ed mcmahon could actually grow hair br br double the chicks double the blow triple the body count and factor in ed mcmahon and james brown you'll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick and one that outshines it's predecessor no less for my money big rip off can play ball with any blaxploitation film ever made even shaft chances are you'll disagree but big rip off has it's own distinct feel something the original was lacking,1
944,i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie it has set the standard i will never again give a movie a 1 unless it was as horrible as this one i fully agree with the other comments about this film but since i'm dutch i watched it with dutch translation apparently they didn't have money for a proper translation so they decided to babelfish it with sometimes hilarious results br br don't smoke don't drink don't do drugs don't watch demon summer br br i was surprised that the actors wow i can't believe i just said that didn't hold the script was there any in their hands while shooting i think they also did a good job on well no they didn't do a good job at all,0
945,now the television schedules in england at least are crammed with home improvement bargain hunting house hunting and cookery shows in the afternoons the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender to say the least but back in the eighties the bbc did just that and guess what i watched it and it's a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian american co production that i can still remember large chunks of it over twenty years later to begin with the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles only to vanish again for at least half an hour imagine an american tail re edited so is nowhere to be seen and you'll appreciate how confusing this is there's a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched complete with a sound effect that causes him to go boss eyed probably hilarious if you're stoned but to a child quite disturbing speaking of which the infamous scene is represented in an abstract manner clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning but it's still pretty unpleasant in fact this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange looking production design all muddy colours wobbly lines bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer only not as compelling then to cap it all we get songs by the this isn't so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip,0
946,mon oncle antoine observes the craggy face of a homespun community from various angles slowly taking its time through the beginning as it should until we emerge from shattered but banal hopes and expectations into swirling of dreams and a heart stopping revelation about the terrible enigma of mortality br br aimless pans and zooms across the snowy mountainside comfort the mind and hypnotize the viewer this restless camera work is personified in a fringe character who is equally the drifter quitting his job at the coal mine and leaving his family to cut lumber then quitting again and returning to the stark humanity of his boy dead br br a fetching old woman cheats on her husband and a young boy dies old things become new and new things die throughout is the snowy whiteness as wonder stricken as the history of cinema,1
947,this movie sucks it's horrible if anyone liked it those people should get there heads examined jackie mason's character sounds like a retard that guy who tries to kill the gopher is a loser and he sucked even though chevy chase was in this movie he wasn't funny this movie had crude and unfunny jokes and did not have rodney dangerfield ted knight and bill murray even though jackie mason's character had the personality of rodney dangerfield's character mason's character sucks rodney dangerfield was funny he should have returned i don't care about ted knight but bill murray should have returned also the original caddyshack was murray's career performance if he was funny in the first he could have been funny in the second br br final comment i recommend this movie to no one this movie sucked it has sucked it sucks now and it will always suck br br 2 10,0
948,i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film trouble is the content could have been fitted in a 30 minute documentary br br there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located this just looked like filler br br also i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying unsuccessfully to it what would we have seen of interest inside anyway a little grandmaster br br also the recent match against i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was it would have been nice to have been told was this a one off 'just for the money' was it part of the world championship cycle what was the final score the of the film was the play in game two could would ibm let kasparov see the machine that's where the focus should have been,0
949,this movie is a disaster within a disaster film it is full of great action scenes which are only meaningful if you throw away all sense of reality let's see word to the wise lava burns you steam burns you you can't stand next to lava diverting a minor lava flow is difficult let alone a significant one scares me to think that some might actually believe what they saw in this movie br br even worse is the significant amount of talent that went into making this film i mean the acting is actually very good the effects are above average hard to believe somebody read the scripts for this and allowed all this talent to be wasted i guess my suggestion would be that if this movie is about to start on tv look away it is like a train wreck it is so awful that once you know what is coming you just have to watch look away and spend your time on more meaningful content,0
950,i cannot stress how bad this movie is this director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so distressed why are their clothes so dirty why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head you should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life buddy giovinazzo br br i take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke why would you ask clark kent to play a crackhead why are they yelling so much why is everyone so mean why are those kids so filthy no one would want to be so filthy not even a crackhead child br br you need to grow up and not make any movies ever again,0
951,we're in a not so distant future globalization seems to have reached a high point languages mixes with each other although english prevails over the rest races have merged human is a fact and all the territory seems to have been divided in two zones the one for the valid and the one for the non valid a brave new world in huxley's style in which people are genetically filed and blood relationships are strictly forbidden for health reasons the code 46 of the title in such environment two souls that are destined not to meet fall in love with each other br br winterbottom had an important story with quite a big potential a nice recipe that he ruins giving it a so slow rhythm narrating it in a so weary way removing any emotions coldness that's all code 46 transmits coldness and boredom not even the presence of samantha morton and tim robbins both of'em play their roles wonderfully nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the movie what a pity br br code 46 what could have been and never was br br my rate 4 10,0
952,what should i say i only saw this flick for curiosity and this is truly a shame i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends and spent 5 years in rennes the town in which this film is said to take place shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes they could at least have chosen a likely town or a likely forest but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience besides those details it could have been a good film but it's crap silly scenario silly characters and no originality definitely to avoid,0
953,this is just my all time favorite movie nothing special it's just so incredibly detailed makes me cry just thinking about it geronimo bill is the nicest guy i can imagine money is not important bamboo spears are important you don't need money to get what you need if you need something it will just come to you if people would realize that the world would be a much better place whatever you do don't do it for the money,1
954,if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn't it if you're looking for something hardcore this isn't it br br that being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early mid 1970's this is it br br i see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974 yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables br br if you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80's and recently 90's adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive ins in the late 1970s br br i first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax many people become upset when later in life it doesn't live up to their previous memories it's understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica br br if you compare to a modern soft core erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very little br br it is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic comedic cinema of the 1970's,1
955,i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watching br br spider forest is neither br br it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up off for the waste of time but spider forest was an exception in this regard i was very off the makers of the film succeeded on one level throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun by the storyline i could not stop watching that's why i was so angry when the film finished they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this warning spider forest is another one of those japanese ghost stories though you don't realize that going in br br i never want to see a japanese ghost story again they're phony and contrived it's a ghost story has become like a big rug under which to sweep any and all plot holes you have in your story telling,0
956,well i don't know much about anything but i sure liked this film in short it was creative humorous simple and heartwarming in other words it was everything it set out to be br br the story is set around a girl's first love as the title suggests and i certainly should warn you expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here i mean it is a children's cartoon it's really just a simple story but it's told well and it holds your attention well br br in the end it's short it's funny it's cute it's simple it's good,1
957,i have seen many possibly too many straight to video no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the good ones or the ones that are less sucky as ridiculous as that sounds hahaha dr chopper is what i kindly like to refer to as absolute crap nothing about it is enjoyable the acting sucks the characters suck the killer sucks the gore is minimal and sucks it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin owned by the parents of one of the kids it is meant to be a relaxing retreat but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeon gone bad along with his two female assistants search for usable tissue to save the doctor his name is dr chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course chops this is just a terrible movie not worthy of anyone's time enough said,0
958,just before dawn is an excellent horror movie it is atmospheric filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature in which few young people meet their doom in the shape of two crazed fat bastards who slaughter them jeff is very talented and intelligent director who is unfortunately underrated he achieved to built tension not with gore but with showing menacing nature environment succeeds to built a tension in a very linear simplistic way which is also the best way not to show to the viewer the gore but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters br br just before dawn was always compared to texas chainsaw massacre deliverance and hills have eyes it is as good looking as deliverance better than hills i mean scarier and better crafted and it is creepy as the texas chainsaw massacre br br is one of the best horrors of past few decades who finally lives on dvd,1
959,i saw this mini movie when it first aired and loved it it kinda funny to see how far people will go for money it's also funny to see how much a boyfriend can be whipped whipped enough to kill i think the cast was great especially the character kristin without her smooth talking and deceptive looks the movie would have not been the same br br i never use to watch usa but now it is one of my stations br br,1
960,this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it robin is somehow mystified by an elk man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of and outright satanic episodes the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor this is barely watchable and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc,0
961,i saw this film on the a e channel this past weekend the mystery was okay i was not able to guess the culprit before the end but i enjoyed the characters and their development much more than the mystery there was a mystery about some of them especially george performed by the wonderful michael and george's cousin susannah in fact the story of those two characters left me wanting to know more from what i've tried to glee about the agatha christie book of the same title i think this film did not follow it to the letter very good performances by the actors involved especially and the lady who played cora companion,1
962,there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me i'm not racist against latinos hell i'm half brazilian i loved the movie kids it doesn't make any sense these kids just go around and do nothing they're not even good at skating the whole time i'm just waiting for something anything to happen but it doesn't nothing happens the whole movie did i mention they suck at skating i might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh t out of poser moron punks like these kids i'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake,0
963,the strawberry blond has a great script but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney he's not the person for the part i do think olivia did a great job this movie is also a day dream wrap around so it's hard to follow i don't like the male character attitude the way cagney presented it was just off i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a attitude and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva br br this movie points out money does not bring happiness women right jokes plain and simple not the best movie but every one must decide for themselves,0
964,if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one and well worth exploring however on the negative side the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses and the music choices more and more bizarre so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying,0
965,i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well compared to these other films this is a rather average to poor film the plot features two warring brothers neither one of which i cared much for and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who the music and cinematography is pretty good but the special effects at times are terrible rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play on top of these complaints the ending of the movie completely destroys and undermines the entire picture it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely fudged what's the point of this then if you have seen this film understand that there are many better films out there so don't give up,0
966,this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back br br awesome talent outstanding performances particularly by victoria hill but a let down in practically every other way br br an adaptation of sorts it brought nothing new to macbeth no setting it in present day australia is not enough and essentially completely failed to justify its existence apart from let's face it completely unnecessarily paying homage to the original work if there's one body of work that has been done and done and done and done it's shakespeare's so any adaptation if it's not to be a self indulgent and pointless exercise needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work br br and that's what this macbeth fails to do as it was done this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever it's the same piece that we have seen countless too many times before except with guns and in different outfits br br apart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which i completely tuned out even though i was looking at the screen i never thought i had a short attention span but there you go br br i suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms but as australia continues to produce world class acting talent its movie makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with br br a shame an absolute shame,0
967,i must have seen this on the television when it was first broadcast some decades ago i thought it was brilliant then and as i remember so much of it now i may have been right while i have lived in and around london i cannot call myself a londoner and do not know it at all well who does other than taxi drivers once the viewer understands the premise that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly unlearn able and rise to the status of demigods then the rest is sheer joy the characters are well contrasted their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently affected by the events of the film don't think this is a documentary it is pure drama and the knowledge is one of the characters i have never seen anything like this film before or since watch it,1
968,i have just finished watching this movie and for me it takes ages to finish because it is so boring and the storyline is extremely bad br br now where should i start o the movie is called sinking of japan yeah yeah it does show that japan is actually sinking but the action part is very bad compare to the movie the day after tomorrow i would have rate it at least 8 10 br br the sinking of japan does not show much about the disaster that actually happening right in front of our eyes there isn't much excitement at all boring all i can say br br one more point i would recommend this movie to have a better title maybe something like the romance of sinking of japan because this movie does have lots of waste of time talk nonsense the love story is extremely boring have been dragging too long honestly i almost get frustrated br br overall this movie does not show enough details of the disasters e g many people running like hell to avoid death love story part was extremely not touching enough for me br br but hey there is one thing we should appreciate about this movie though its has got good songs,0
969,but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time br br i got this dvd cheap with sandra bullock as headliner on the case this is false advertising she's on screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie br br on the other hand there was no other selling point for this movie the dialog was horrible the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes the directing was well let's just say that my 14 yo daughter could do better but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me it's possible that the family cat could have done better br br sandra does a creditable job for a first film in the short time she's on screen and that's the only redeeming quality of this film stupid story poorly written and transferred to film as only a 7th grade media class should be able to do br br in short this is dreck,0
970,i know the girl who did the figure skating for the lead girl she once dated my brother and she was always really nice i also live in b c about 15 or so minutes from fort steele haha i used to go there for field trips when i was in elementary school it was kinda weird seeing it in the movie i also had the chance when the movie was filming to be an extra because there was a casting call for them at the mall but i didn't feel like going to it at the time because i wasn't interested in acting now i totally wish i did this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay it never came out here which is kind of weird seeing it was partially filmed here so i was excited when it came i really loved the story line and the bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away,1
971,though often considered peter sellers' worst film it is in fact an excellent send up of medical corporate corruption and abuses of power often misunderstood the film is actually a departure from the type of film sellers was best known for satirical farce this film had excellent performances by jo ann pflug and pat morita of happy days and the karate kid movies but was marked by its irreverence and total madcap demolition of the medical industry of the day it was ahead of its time 1972 in taking the outrageous path that the monty python crew would take into the cinema some time later as such it was unacceptable to the traditional peter sellers fan who found the more pointed barbs in this humor to be something to which they were unaccustomed presently peter sellers movies are in demand by fans but this effort where does it hurt has by its nature become almost impossible to find,1
972,matt is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party even though this isolates himself from his son family and neighbors what makes this even more difficult is that is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities the party is trying to create a strike at the mill whereby the pro strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda also has to contend with beautiful eve a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that is a double agent when eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives the reds decide she must be liquidated and must aid her without endangering himself the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but by today's standards very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills lovejoy is very good in the main role but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary rating 4,0
973,i thought that this movie was incredible i absolutely loved it even though my brothers didn't that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen it was everything i would expect out of a movie i just loved it also it was pretty kid friendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible i would give it a pure 10 10 it was better than the legend of and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined absolutely amazing loved it,1
974,i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes i feel comfortable writing it now because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end br br the premise is simple enough rabid dog on the loose in a small town kills people great simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror br br uhh no br br the main problem is this is based on a book stephen king and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film at least not with the same plot why cuz its boring the first 45 minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense it however lasts too long half the film the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway and it just about creates zero suspense the easiest film according to plot and time to compare this to it the classic jaws everything that jaws does right cujo does wrong jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread cujo does neither jaws effectively creates a scary creepy villain in its shark cujo has a dirty st bernard running about growling and jumping and not a lot else jaws is exciting and unpredictable cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end br br also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot br br if this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good but it wasn't it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life br br people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations im sorry you could not be more wrong the mist is a hundred times better thinner is 10 times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good this in my opinion is one of the worst the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real even though they were dull br br films ended now and it didn't get any better avoid,0
975,sir arthur conan doyle wrote a fair number of sherlock holmes accounts but the popularity of the famous detective insured that sequels in both print and on film would extend far beyond the author's works br br in sherlock holmes and the secret weapon holmes basil rathbone serves british intelligence in order to secure a swiss scientist's desperately needed bombsight the film is from 1942 and i wonder if the producers and writers realized how vital bombsight secrets were the american norden bombsight was guarded almost as as the new radar sets that would change the course of world war ii br br holmes and his faithful but expectedly bumbling companion dr watson nigel bruce battle dr moriarty lionel atwill as evil as moriarty has always been it's a bit of a shock to see he's signed up with hitler has the man no vestige of decency i guess not but atwill is deliciously evil br br the story is reasonably fast paced as holmes and watson seek to recover stolen bombsight components before they can be delivered to a u boat rathbone is his usual suave self and several disguises are well carried out br br this and other 1940s holmes stories are now available on dvd and oldies com has put out a very nice four disc set in a wooden box this film is included along with a bonus cd of an interview with the aged doyle the set for about 26 in major dvd and cd stores but i found this and other sets from oldies com at a warehouse club for 14 98 the transfers are very good br br very nice and relaxing late night viewing br br 7 10,1
976,tex tenure as director of cartoons for mgm was in the 1940s and 50s was one of the brightest moments in cartoon history his cartoons were exceptionally inventive and surreal with many weird touches that were later celebrated in the movie the mask eyes popping out when a guy sees a girl impossible stunts and non stop action were the trademarks of these films br br this is one of several droopy cartoons that avery was responsible for and it's among his best droopy is a mountie and he is determined to get his man though in this case it's a wolf who has escaped from prison throughout the film despite many insane stunts droopy keeps up with this crook until eventually the wolf gives up because droopy is seemingly everywhere full of funny gags and loaded with laughs this is a great cartoon,1
977,obviously this is not the piranha directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman it wasn't so obvious when i bought the dvd for only 2 95 as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy horror piranha even the dvd menu no features of course matched the cover half way through watching this odd movie my girlfriend and i started thinking where are the piranhas once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer which had completely different footage the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits actors producer director were also completely different instead we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter this tame exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old school camp value strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b grade movies of the same name made in the 70's reading other posts made on this film i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd how could this be an international error is there perhaps some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds what is going on,0
978,i would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie i have ever seen it's not just the actors that are bad but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time anyone that likes this must be crazy this movie is a waste of time,0
979,one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3 strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria i half wondered if blake edwards was naming the character played by elke sommer in a shot in the dark after this now forgotten performer though the spelling of the sommer character's surname was actually i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la cucaracha that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy devine as a great bull fighter yeah right and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume only funny part of those two is when they cry with buster providing handkerchief to bull during the sad part of la cucaracha also lame was seeing ted healy without his stooges dealing with a crasher who keeps mistaking healy for other movie stars healy himself didn't know zeppo had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx speaking of a marx it was interesting seeing harpo without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head also interesting was seeing ida lupino among the cowgirls in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the vanities last year at least when announcer pete smith identified her oh and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise guy narration other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m g m contract players either so with all that said la de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy garland's early film appearances or the early use of 3 strip technicolor,0
980,this is one of julie's greatest tributes to music alongside her trapped in the body of a white girl album to quote the great medusa dare to go bare just wear your underwear you'll get a ride home everytime wow now that is some good advice you can dance at my party yeah justify your dance shoes you're invited to the party in my pants yeah come on boy let's dance at the party in my pants julie brown is hilarious it is almost sad that this video is only 51 minutes long but every minute is awesome,1
981,michelle pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colourful black comedy matthew modine plays a clumsy fbi agent who has taken a fancy to her dean stockwell steals the show as the big shot who keeps on pfeiffer mercedes ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife it's all very eighties but that just adds to the fun a nice little flick though not for every taste,1
982,this is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens i unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel and i'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive i love having been a big fan of both black books and green wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts however she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided please broadcasters bear in mind that the trades descriptions act may well be invoked if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological romanticism and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor fowl,0
983,definitely not only for urban legend aficionados campfire tales is an often scary and always fun ride through several popular stories it is also a film that exceeded the low expectations i had a horror film i had never heard or read about a straight to video release granted the latter often presents us with a pleasant surprise but with horror films nowadays it can be all or nothing a cast of mostly unknowns well i'll leave the math to you br br the film proves to be an entertaining suspenseful and overall very enjoyable experience the four stories are well paced and satisfying the only one i felt was a little weaker was the for the simple reason that it offers almost no explanation for its plot or the characters' actions however i still loved the tale its atmosphere and ending my favorite one was the third story people can lick too the suspense in it is not only palpable but also educational br br i found campfire tales to be one of those horror gems one discovers by chance and then goes on recommending it to everyone br br 7 10,1
984,the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments much less hundreds of speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization br br read proust you morons or at least dave barry or calvin and anthologies br br chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes nay hours viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service br br please don't watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells,0
985,this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end ok so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma but that is all he achieves about 10 minutes into the film i thought oh no here we go again and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minutes or so patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role and her acting was wooden and unconvincing mind you being saddled with such an awfully conventional script maybe boredom set in and was such reflected on the screen a lot of the film was just plain laughable at one stage arquette's elderly companion is shot and he is prostrate on the ground in the next scene he is sprinting through the forest obviously attempting to break the world 100 meters record or maybe he's just trying to run away from boorman if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond on your vcr and you'll be snoring in no time i very rarely a film as heavily as this but in this case it is completely justified,0
986,the opening scene of the beach at while amusing in itself unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film insipid and washed out it is actually not as corny as most of the others in the carry on series but maybe because of that doesn't really deliver much fun it's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the benny hill show but those looking for attractive females in bikinis and miniskirts while they will see some in this will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series such as carry on abroad or carry on up the jungle more the emergence of early 1970s feminism is used as a plot device which seems rather self defeating,0
987,from all the rave reviews we couldn't wait to see this show we love wacky humor and creative material especially from australia and new zealand br br i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes but we just couldn't bear any more misery it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show it felt like 15 hours the songs may be mildly interesting by themselves but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work br br we're trying hard now to erase the memory if you want some wonderful down under humor in a delightful and engaging film see the dish instead,0
988,this is an extremely competent movie technically the camera work and direction are excellent and the acting is fine as well especially the fine acting by daniel auteuil as the marquis i really thought there were no problems at all with these aspects of the film instead i was a bit annoyed by the way the marquis was portrayed as it didn't seem all that honest and seems to be a very view of history in fact in recent years the marquis has undergone a bit of a transformation to a defender of freedom with great insight not the fat sado masochist rapist he really was in a way this is highly reminiscent of the whitewash given in the people versus larry flint where these men are elevated to hero status even if you don't think that the perversions weren't all that bad they included rapes and extreme violence his portrayal in this film as a sexual social worker in this prison seems pretty silly instead of the violent and selfish sade he spends a lot of time carefully grooming a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her own sensuality what a nice and kind man in fact now that i think about it this performance reminds me of the man maurice chavalier played in gigi but without the singing a cute older man who loves the ladies i strongly doubt the real life marquis de sade would have recognized this character at all br br the film surprisingly doesn't have a lot of nudity though what it does show is extremely explicit only a maniac would let their kids see this as this is a very adult drama it's very well made and pretty entertaining just not all that truthful the director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview among the special features on the dvd i watched so go ahead and see the film if you'd like understanding it just isn't very good historically during the 18th century sexual were quite accepted in france as they were pretty broad minded so despite what the movie implies it wasn't sex that was the issue it was the violence and rape that was and still is the problem,0
989,did anyone notice when miss brook went skinny dipping she left the water wearing white bikini bottoms and yet had previously taken it all off to join cabin boy this could have been a good film without miss brooks phony accent and a year on the island please how come that kelly looked always clean and ready for a fm photo shoot what started out with premise turned in to soft porn and billy zane come on you cant be that hard up for film offers check out dead calm also when the people took her away how come she scoffed her face and after all that time didn't feel like throwing up i suggest billy find decent scripts kelly stick to photo shoots and cabin boy play the son of zorro in a future sequel,0
990,what a waste of a great cast figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well known actors what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them calling it a comedy was a stretch as well the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song which was basically tenacious d i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted,0
991,all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasn't i'll admit to not finishing the film i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get and i quote more tail than any man in the past time i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to a story that will keep a viewer interested and they failed this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian would be like and i'm not against lesbians thank you mr director someone please give me a redeeming quality wait i have it there's no sequel,0
992,spoilers warning i cannot say enough good things about this movie it is a great horror comedy spoof that does everything right for a change the humor is great and ranges from funny to so funny you'll cry funny in one scene ed goes edit crazy and deletes a big scene when his boss is looking at ed's edit he yells out where in the fu is my beaver rape scene hysterical there are also many other great humorous memorable quotes and moments throughout ed yells out don't you fu ing look at me while punching some poor schmuck repeatedly in the face very funny stuff the plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it's priceless ed is a mild mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror film editing department and after a while goes nuts sees monsters and attacks people while quoting the horror movies that he has edited this movie has it all and is simply hilarious the dvd only costs about 7 and is a great bargain as it is the unrated widescreen cut i own a lot of dvd's most of which cost a lot more money than this one but not many are as great as this movie my evil ed dvd is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a telephone receiver if they tried to steal it evil ed oozes style and quality something that hollywood filmmakers need to majorly learn evil ed is a rare gem and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie you did everything right and i love evil ed 10 out of 10,1
993,to identify this movie as a vampire movie would be technically correct simply because it will suck the life right out of you br br vampire effect is an insult to movie buffs everywhere the plot is almost non existent the make up is just plain awful and the acting is just not there br br i have to wonder if jackie chan owed someone a huge favor to be convinced to appear in this film br br my wife picked up the movie at the rental store because it had a picture of jackie chan on the front as though he was playing the lead and thought that a good jc flick would be fun to watch this movie was interesting to watch in the same way that you can't help staring at the car wreck when you drive by you realize very quickly the movie isn't going to get any better but you keep watching wonder just how bad it will get,0
994,this is the slowest film noir film i've ever seen very weak script only provides opportunity for jack palance and rod steiger to deliver exceptionally well lines that were made for an acting audition palance and steiger both affirm they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power emotion and drama the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace mostly taking place in a living room the director obviously moved the actors around in a circles as they delivered long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience the action doesn't pick up until the last ten minutes of the film if you're one who's looking for more depth in a crime drama this one's not for you,0
995,in the muslim country of fictional its benevolent leader dictator reed hadley as amir is dying of cancer amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds his body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation the population does not know of his death consisting of his doctor and mohammed out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant the surgery is being performed by the disgraced dr kent taylor who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants one of them is about 3 feet high master blaster did indeed run barter town and the other is a mutilated traumatized 7 foot giant named gor what could possibly go wrong br br did i forget to mention deathbed american blonde barbie wife tracy or that dr kent has a dungeon with female slave test subjects delusions of grandeur how about a brain transplant that didn't take there is a lot of double dealing throughout this and people are killed but i'm not going to lie to you anymore mission accomplished the ends justify the means if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes i hope that is warning enough don't say i didn't warn you if you must watch then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by br br celluloid rehab,0
996,before i sat down and watched this film on hbo i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot well that's exactly what i got out of it except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie i wasn't expecting it to be i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste well it was but still it was somewhat worth it the whole plot was very stupid cheap acting and some of the lines were very very dumb otherwise than that it still had it's funny moments even though not many br br all in all if you're going to rent this don't watch it on television i gave it a 4 i was generous because it made me laugh but yet it was still pretty stupid,0
997,i'd chose either over this film this film has been in my must see list for a while because people talked about it being disturbing and also the vhs box contains lots and lots of quotes from people saying how amazing it is or how as close as you can get to texas chainsaw massacre and lines like that but sorry folks i was disappointed big time the idea is interesting but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes a mistaken creation of evolution and people do indeed to the dumbest films in the film br br that in turn takes away any credibility that the plot may have otherwise had i couldn't believe how unnecessarily loooooong some where is he let's find him sequences were a few gory moments to please the gore fan but they are so few that by the time we get to them there's no point if luther's a geek then the filmmakers must really be down on the food chain,0
998,a surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as batman tas and its ilk i enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again great voice acting from tim curry richard moll tony jay and maurice lamarche in various roles the only qualm i had was rob voice seemed a little too old for the title character but that wasn't a big deal as the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending some people say it was a cop out but i found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging hopefully one day they put this series out on dvd unfortunately it came out at a time when dvd's weren't yet prevalent and the cartoon probably only served to sell a particular type of toy which i never found appealing despite the entertaining cartoon,1
999,i saw this in 1993 on a vhs tape but have been unable to find it at any source since this is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the japanese army in the phillipines anyone with an interest in the pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under from what i can tell this is historically accurate and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism i understand the japanese army was completely cut off from any re supply in the phillipines by 1945 so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened i might not have been able to identify with the film's characters but i appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive if i had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films this film would be on it see it if you can get it,1
1000,the headline describes it exactly this dribble of a film was nothing more than the typical 'group of teens killed someone accidentally now that someone is haunting killing them off 20 years later' crap that has been shoved down our throats for decades the only twist is instead of an angry ex classmate or lovable psycho loser it was a nun nun wants to eliminate the sin from the girls blah blah girls accidentally purposely drown the nun blah blah nun haunts the girls people die movie ends the only thing that made this watchable were the death scenes which were pretty cool especially the one with the elevator door ripping off this fat lady's arms but even they couldn't make this a great movie brian yuzna should hang his head for attaching himself to this refuse i'm sure glad i rented it and didn't buy it or i'd be furious beyond belief if you want a nunsploitation flick to please the senses go watch or something stay away from this garbage,0
1001,i blame birth of a nation myself for commencing the long running tradition of hollywood of history of which there can be few greater examples than this apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition try custer and his wife's learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory custer's testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all custer's storming into the president's office to beg to return to his post honestly there's plenty more of the same some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness and yet and yet it's still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever dehavilland as beguiling as ever the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth here i think we're closer to the legend of the legend but hey it's only a movie and a rollicking wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that,1
1002,when oh when will hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story br br no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts br br as for tracing people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way network security alone would prevent that from happening the key stroke logging was laughable to say the least br br regarding the software that was supposedly being installed no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested and tested again on a sandbagged system br br but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the virus there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system and as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds that just beggars belief there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required access that would allow deletion of system files br br i could go on but i can't be bothered br br a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage,0
1003,i saw this movie in the early 1990's when it had been out on vhs for a little while at the time i found it to be interesting and was especially struck by the ken russell segment with the visions of the accident victim in triage and surgery br br last night at a 2nd run showing of the latest indiana jones movie the vision of john hurt prompted an unexpected flashback to aria which i had not thought of in years and the sudden memory of the russell piece itself was enough to cause an outbreak of tears for a little bit br br if i can make this observation i note with interest the love hate reaction that people have expressed to the russell segment and i have found this interesting difference in other movies that delve into deep trauma and its aftereffects some get it others do not interesting br br i see by the comments and the rating that the overall work hit people in various ways this is how it affected and affects me,1
1004,i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and cliché' the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team this is so bad it's funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime i'd recommend it highly as a comedy as for being a serious movie i'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2 br br don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be found br br edit hmmm i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down don't believe them this is a really crappy movie,0
1005,oh boy where do i begin on this piece of slime this is one of the few real high budget films on my list that i've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating and that's not for the production values which are pretty high this movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy i could not recommend it to anyone except to see how low as a society we have become br br for the first thing noah was absolutely not friends with lot anyone who actually read genesis could tell you that was who they were thinking of the writers were just trying to pad out the story with the whole subplot and it seems out of place because it is noah is treated as a prudish goofball you were kissing you were kissing but at least it's a step up from voight's hilarious overacting in anaconda br br however these offenses pale in comparison to the heretical treatment of god in this movie god is portrayed as a petty being who changes his mind at the slightest whim i'm one eternal perfect but i can be wrong what where are they getting this from this kind of god no one should ever pay any attention to much less worship praise or love what the director's saying in this i do not claim to know i just know that a responsible treatment of noah's ark should not take such an easy way out shame on these people,0
1006,of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it br br the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it br br if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time it is bad br br they are making a sequel so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie but i don't think it is possible,0
1007,with a film starring the twins ekin cheng and edison chen nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema what you do get however is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain there are loads of hollywood style vampires no hopping chinese bloodsuckers here cute girls handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment and jackie chan br br sure the kung fu relies heavily on wire work and cgi sure the script reminds you of blade and sure the whole affair is instantly forgettable br br but for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff you would be hard pushed to find better,1
1008,amanda bynes is an enormously talented actress and i've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past especially in the fantastic she's the man for that reason alone sydney white was a huge disappointment for me the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters in a good fun teen comedy its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality based teen characters in sydney white this idea is thrown out the window br br amanda bynes makes a fine sydney but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress i blame this on the script which makes her character too bland and restrained and on the hair makeup department which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style the seven dorks that sydney eventually befriends are far worse they are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters they're essentially repulsive gag fodder as is the story's prince charming who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be br br perhaps the film's biggest star to be with the possible exception of amanda bynes is sara paxton who's actually very good as the conniving rachel it's just a shame that the script writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black br br the plot is basically that of snow white what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re imagining the connections to snow white are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown prince charming is unrealistically charming the witch is far too despicably witchy the seven dorks are too dorky and sydney is just too pure of heart now this is not to say that the movie is all bad though bynes is forced down by the script she still has her moments as does sara paxton who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes room mate named dinky is also great fun as a character it's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichéd to recommend,0
1009,this was a very disappointing movie i would definitely call this the worst movie of all time br br the acting and writing were poor and the jokes were not funny br br i don't see why on earth this piece of crap was even made i'm not a picky person and i can enjoy stupid things but this is just way too stupid and just plain awful br br avoid this wretched piece of garbage at all costs,0
1010,i thought this film was amazing and i laughed so much that i had to see it twice to catch the bits i missed whilst bending over holding my stomach the critic who reviewed this film for this site challenged anyone with an iq over their shoe size to find this film funny well my iq is approx 135 i challenge this person to question me and then eat his own words this film is brilliant and if the critic above wasn't such a boring idiot he might smile for once in his life and take things as lightly as they're meant br br the musical numbers were so imaginative everyone when watching any film about that period of time will notice men in tights and realise how different it is to today's attire and how funny we would find today's male population if they wore tights day in day out the idea of dedicating a song to butch men dancing in tights was so fresh how can anyone not laugh plus also seeing hip hop rappers doing ballet is always hysterical as a dancer also i've done ballet and hip hop and danced with men who've had to do both it still cracks me up each time br br i love this film if anyone hasn't seen it yet don't listen to the critic above watch it and then decide for yourself,1
1011,i happened upon a rare copy of this early almodovar film with high expectations almodovar is a prolific contemporary director i enjoyed his 1988 film women on the verge of a nervous breakdown and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film well i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film i just found it incoherent tasteless and boring yes there are plenty of innuendos people in drag and crude sexual situations and yes these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 which was almost certainly almodovar's intention but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years leaving a limp storyline beyond that the whole movie seemed very chaotic none of the characters were particularly sympathetic and for a comedy even a dark one i just didn't find this film funny i suppose it is possible there is a very select audience for a film like this but i'm just not part of that audience and not sure that i want to be,0
1012,i wish i could have voted this movie a ten it's that funny if they had intended for it to be that funny i would have given it a ten i have to give it a 1 but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to watch see the giant blur flash across the screen where did it come from what is it it flies it terrifies it's electrifying it's on strings this bird has real personality i was about ten when i saw it for the first time and when big bird appeared on sesame street i was sure they were one and the same,0
1013,i've spent quite a while going through all the reviews for this film i'm in total agreement with almost every reviewer in saying that noah's ark is crap crap crap crap crap don't the executives at nbc have any class i feel sick to my stomach for actually watching both parts of this mini series the script is so dumb so pointless and yes totally inaccurate i can understand making a few changes for dramatic purposes but this film changed just about everything in the story god himself is going to go through the trouble to kill off the entire earth's population but he somehow misses one guy that's sailing around trying to sell stuff to noah give me a break and what was up with noah's sons acting like indiana jones saving girls in distress if all that isn't bad enough there's the part where god apologizes to noah and says i'm sorry noah i was wrong newsflash nbc god can not be wrong this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made,0
1014,sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date however instead we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas the cast worked hard but it just didn't gel recently stephen showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie king of texas,0
1015,randy bowers john wayne comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to ed rogers proprietor of the establishment he's observed by the dead man's niece sally alberta vaughn from behind a hidden room where she remained unobserved during the carnage br br randy rides alone was directed by harry fraser he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films where he fast forwards the action from one location to another usually involving a rider on a horse it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns br br pre gabby george hayes is on hand sans whiskers and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role first as hunchbacked businessman matt the mute communicating via pencil and paper only to turn into marvin black leader of a gang of outlaws black's gang was responsible for the murders at half way house in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt marvin another staple player is here as well yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike interestingly yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser wayne oater the arizona skies br br there's a fair amount of time killing horseback riding back and forth between black's gang and the sheriff's posse as john wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys in the end he saves the day by securing sally rogers' thirty thousand dollars at the expense of destroying the half way house where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six shooter and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain in his best aw shucks attitude john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers and alas randy rides alone no more,0
1016,now this movie is the worst i have ever seen it is simply a disaster i think it's really a sick movie i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap i can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster such a waste of money and time nothing to learn from this movie it's just a hollow sick evil flick i don't think they could've make it worse this movie just earned it's title as the king of lowest crap the acting is a disaster the meaning oh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie do yourself a favor if you actually have some self respect keep away from this awfulness,0
1017,umberto hits new lows with this recycled trash janet plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type religous cult in new guinea she hires a scruffy guide played by robert to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle this is another cannibal movie and i probably would have liked it if not for padding this film out with scenes from his superior the man from deep river i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film which i guess makes him about as credible as al adamson i felt ripped off spoiler 1 2 star and that's for the dildo scene,0
1018,this movie treads on very familiar ground the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull the final scene in particular is interminably tedious seeing the audience crying at the moving acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask who do they think they are kidding br br nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes particularly from some of the minor characters ben gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him br br christopher walken again plays an over the top wacko remember his character the continental on saturday night live an aging eurotrash chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed he does an identical turn in the film chasing his young male prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne br br overall this film was both enchanting and irritating but mostly irritating,0
1019,a very un tom and jerry short jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival butch tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing the should have just put puss gets the boot on the dvd instead and i would've been happy this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother's 2 dvd spotlight collection set it's the last one on the set and i'm hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon br br my grade c,0
1020,i was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie all the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues rather like deer in headlights they dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken i found myself yelling at the tv screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something the plot line is implausible every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan clearly the import of the decision is obvious you don't need to treat the audience as idiots overall there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie,0
1021,although i rarely agree with i have to say that this film while not awful just didn't make me care at all and it all just seemed to be out of place it had its moments three or four ones that made me snicker but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why why did the characters do this even hot shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out br br if you want to see a nice film then watch there it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the swedish tundra br br i am so disappointed,0
1022,all in all this is a movie for kids we saw it tonight and my child loved it at one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible however i am a great fan of a a books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters this film was not subtle it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it doesn't have the permission to use them i found myself wishing the theater was replaying winnie the pooh and too instead the characters voices were very good i was only really bothered by the music however was twice as loud in parts than the dialog and incongruous to the film br br as for the story it was a bit preachy and militant in tone overall i was disappointed but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face br br i liked laugh,0
1023,this is the best movie i've ever seen and i've seen a lot i'm not even a troma fan i've never heard of troma before watching this movie br br i had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw tromeo and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many taboos br br this movie is neither disgusting nor stupid it's hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the characters br br it is certainly not for troma's fans only it's for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that don't dare to do what this movie does br br the bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isn't understood and appreciated by all people,1
1024,perhaps i'm just a simple person but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie this was supposed to be a comedy maybe the humor was too subtle for me all the way down to the nano level the thing about it is it missed on so many things there were characters that could have been funny but they weren't there were characters that you could have liked but you didn't for instance the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs there was so much potential there but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off haha and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the scene like it was special what he played 'i am the on an old piano and sang out of tune is there an inside joke there it sure stank at face value this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it that you get the whole metaphysical art garbage message the artist is expressing if you want to be entertained stay away,0
1025,this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie's work a lifeless muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace and the budget of its predecessors death on the nile evil under the sun and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go of course he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie's plot alone all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest but the direction is hopelessly flat 1 2,0
1026,shuttle is was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way i ever could imagine this movie has lost its story if you can call it a story after half an hour all the next scenes are totally out of proportion the driver is some kind of superman because he survives every attack with gun knife etc even after stabbed in his leg he was able to put her in the box but what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage i really felt sick and misled when the movie ended it could have been such a great one if the story was far more better in my opinion even a kid would make a better story and why shipping the girl with water and food i quit with counting the plot holes about halfway through and when the movie reached its almost admirably sick over the top final twist i had completely given up better say throw up the worst thing about shuttle is actually that it can not be even more worse that worse maybe writer director anderson will learn from this lesson and provide us with a decent thriller next time think the better he'll move to a different genre i keep my fingers crossed but from now on i will read the comment on his future movies first before looking a waste of time,0
1027,i was pleasantly surprised by the depth of story and character development fulci was a master at creating horrific atmosphere using inventive camera work vivid cinematography and yes wonderfully explicit gore br br this film is no exception however compared to his later films the beyond zombie 2 city of the living dead house by the cemetery etc the characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis shies away from the supernatural and is more on the suspense created by a classic who dunnit amongst the lush hills of italy the scenery is at moments reminiscent of cherished folklore and then immediately contrasted by mud and blood soaked terror shrouded by crumbling ruins the gore in this film is not quite as prevalent and seems restrained compared to fulci's later films however splatter and giallo fans will most likely be satiated by a few close ups of oozing wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film br br overall a fantastic and mature film from one of our great italian horror directors,1
1028,honestly i don't really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show it embraces the elements of the original while expanding on them the storytelling has been updated and while some of the episodes seem to be a bit fast that is a good thing br br christopher eccleston is perfect in the role easily as good as tom baker br br rose is one of the best companions on par with sarah jane smith or br br i like the concept that the have been destroyed no more with the doctor acting as president emeritus and it adds something to the character to be the only one left br br the sfx are outstanding especially in comparison to the original br br take it from me and i was a huge dr who geek i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number 1 to dr number 8 i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon personally this is the best sci fi show on tv right now possibly ever watch it and buy the dvd,1
1029,what can i say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here they pretty much sum up everything the people who love it cherish it the people who hate it well they loathe it this is the movie equivalent of marmite br br i personally have committed every second of it to memory it is cyclical claustrophobic introspective magical and stands as being one of the most unique films ever made despite what many have stated i believe this truly is a cult movie it is a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered once unearthed it's fantastical psychedelic visuals and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable which is an achievement in itself one of my friends who watched it likened it more to a musical and in many respects to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made would probably get more out of it to view head as such br br i was always fond of the monkees especially the t v show back when it was repeated during the 80's my mum had recorded head for me when it was shown on t v late night as she knew i liked them i watched it a day later and it lodged in my memory until i was able to find a copy on dvd about 2 decades later what i would love now is a special edition it would be fascinating to get a greater insight into the making of this masterpiece we can only hope,1
1030,'the big came into my life complete by accident and has left an indelible mark on my soul a scar of love destruction and pointlessness that will forever be a part of my life this is tale of beautiful futility we are helpless without each other we are helpless against governmental wrong doings we are helpless as to the choices we all try to make when in love deaf to the mutterings and goings on of an world outside the window blind to an inevitable apocalypse dumb of the hatred and greedy opinions of an over indulgent society this is a tale of personal commitment and triumphant love defeating the ideologies of war their petty bickering is a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with it's pains and darkness everyone has some irritating aspect to their personality and this is observed by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way we travel only a short distance with the two main characters but are left wanting to complete our own journeys with a some of their simple loving honest philosophy in tow i am so very glad that i exist in this 'our time' another 20 years either side of my birth date and i would not have seen and felt the big snit william white sheffield,1
1031,i watch many movies but presently my genre number one is asian horror i have just bought this dvd and i initially found an intriguing but confused film since i had not understood many parts of the story but i saw in imdb board a message titled explanation of a masterpiece all your questions answered faster load written by and i was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story i would like to congratulate for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in imdb to help and guide other viewers br br in the end i agree that is a great korean film but i do not give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once like this film demands and without the great support of i would not be able to understand the story as a whole i intend to see this movie again in a near future my vote is eight br br title brazil fear,1

1033,i really loved this original screenplay and the different places it took me emotionally spiritually and just plain silly stuff i didn't get caught up in believability in the screenplay or the actors and didn't even think about it until reading the reviews listed here in imdb for the movie listening to michael talk at the q a about his idea of the film wanting to see how crazy people or up people as he put it fall in love is really interesting i identified with not having a story book romance and liked seeing dysfunction at it's best i like watching david in anything he does and have followed his career for a few years now i believe this is some of his best work and say to anyone just see this film to watch an amazing young actor i agree that guillermo díaz really was a scene stealer and what he did with his character is really a great acting lesson in commitment i laughed and cried both in this movie and was disappointed that it didn't win any awards at the festival i question why that didn't happen i gave max and grace a ten because these interesting unique creative indie films deserve an audience technically watching this film it's really beautifully done  the colors are amazing and lastly it's one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a film in awhile,1
1034,a combat veteran fresh from completion of training reunites with an old friend in manila and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron br br but do you really care about that if you're even reading this page you must know something of what to expect it's your typical chop socky complete with ridiculous dialouge mega corny villains apocalyptic sound editing and a camera that begs for your attention the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho kosugi franco nero ain't no slouch either assuming you can see around the mustache br br well i'm being too harsh there are some good laughs enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming ninja and delivering arguably the goofiest death scene ever captured on film,0
1035,phoned work sick watched this in bed and it was so awful i would have went back to work if i could have gotten out of bed the dog ran off with the remote so i was stuck br br i'm positive hammer was grooming the eldest daughter to become his br br horrendous to watch made me vomit more than what i was doing anyway so there you have it this would be the film that they play in the waiting room of hell before you go in or maybe your stuck in the film for all eternity with the hart kids just remember to take a gun with you,0
1036,put the film down and back slowly away the acting rivals a highschool play the plot is and the production values are slightly higher than community theater the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher rooms are switched around the dead move dogs are used for wolves men shot point blank with 45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles blouses button and without human touch this is a movie i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating there is no accounting for taste btw there is no nudity,0
1037,oh my god where to begin terror is one of the worst b horror movies ever made this crap makes demon slayer look like the exorcist special note a horror b movie needs to have at least one sex scene don't expect even a hot girl in this one with that inexcusable mistake i should begin with the complete bash br br first of all if you're going to make a horror monster movie you should spend big part of the budget in creating a cool monster outfit the monster in this movie looks like a 10 halloween costume there is no way the yes this is how it is spelled looks menacing in the movie it's an actor in a halloween outfit please it looks so cheap it makes me mad br br second the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct to video monster horror movie again the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects the blood looks damn fake please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two that's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds the ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied br br the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies but in this movie it's beyond terrible a cast of nobodies with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince swat members that he is sick the coughing he fakes is beyond laughable he's probably the worst actor ever in a b horror movie no kidding also captain peña delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick br br the true story behind the is not even told all you get to know is that the monster sucks goat's blood why bother with this piece of crap do not even watch it even if you have the chance not even if it airs on cable br br i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something different than hollywood but that doesn't means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage,0

1042,to answer the question of a previous reviewer who asked the name of the u s official mentioned in the name of the character is mr carlucci frank carlucci is reported as having been at that time second secretary at the u s embassy in the congo subsequently among other assignments he was appointed u s ambassador to portugal deputy director of the central intelligence agency secretary of defense and is now the chairman of the carlyle group it's hardly surprising that biographical sketch on his www com web site fails to credit his service in the belgian congo if his name was deliberately censored from the hbo version of it may have been to avoid the possibility of hbo's being sued in u s courts name however is clearly mentioned in the theatre version of that i saw recently in the event i expect that he would deny any involvement in murder br br others have commented on the evenhandedness with which the film treats the parties concerned supporters other even belgians a somewhat more sinister view emerges i think from the bbc documentary entitled who killed based on the book the murder of by belgian historian de witte when examined closely these films demonstrate that the fate of and the history of the congo is not just a matter of black and white only murderers believe that,1
1043,this was such a great film it was done with such beautiful design such symmetry i love the way the classical music tied in with the classical art of earth space and beyond it was such a fluent and thought provoking masterpiece i loved the way the monoliths never changed although primate earth and space did i loved how it was a question of do you need me us now the movie expressed desire peace love curiosity finesse gentleness courage and innocence what more could you ask for from a mere movie perhaps a complement movie any appreciator of 2001 a space odyssey will find the movie 2010 is 2001's complement movie 2010 is more story orientated than 2001,1
1044,sure there's stuff here that the and elmore leonard have done before but so what if you want entertaining lusty and smart judas kiss is near perfect offended by tongue in cheek porn don't get it talk about getting your sex and violence out of the way straight up keeps your investors happy that's independent filmmaking 101 as for the brits making a bundle i highly doubt it this flick is clearly a labor of love and the budget probably not half of mr tarantino's salary maybe guys don't like it as much as women i thought it rocked go coco,1
1045,i have seen it a few times and get completely glued to it every time it is very suspenseful and intense to describe it sounds boring but it is amazing it is the kind of movie where you need can't miss a thing but if you soak it in it sticks with you long after it ends now thinking about it i don't even know what stone was trying to make us see just the story of alan green i don't think so it was a look at ignorance stupidity self absorption and a guy just loosing his grip maybe he had more grip than the listeners though i didn't like barry but still seemed worried about him for some reason i was perplexed at why i couldn't get him out of my mind when the movie ended i wish i could see inside olive stone's mind for this one,1
1046,to this day i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie poorly acted poorly plotted and racially neanderthal it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club spoiler ahead br br spoiler her blues solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' was as dumb as a post the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them br br i have to say though there is one special thing about this movie it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper the phantom menace and catwoman could not make me sick to my stomach,0
1047,why did they change the cute rugrats television show we all know and love into a lame attempt to target teens they don't have to do that all ages watch the regular rugrats when i heard about this i thought hey they made a tv series about the movie except they're really grown up as a teenager this is going to be better when i saw it it was just as if i was watching as told by ginger except they made it suck great job br br when in the rugrats series has tommy been a director never basically all the episodes in this attempted series is about tommy's love of directing i don't like that i rather watch plots that change every episode not the same thing over and over also when did in the old series have each character have their own sides of the story never this series did that i didn't like that everyone separated i don't want to see angelica's side of the story i hate her br br i do not recommend this show if you like as told by ginger and the rugrats,0
1048,pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique 1 throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience 2 deal only in big' topics such as life death and god 3 make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc 4 depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt 5 and finally laugh all the way to critical acclaim br br this movie is pretentious faux intellectualism at its boldest not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions they're afraid to pose the questions to begin with the film is held together by wisps directions are raised and dropped awkwardly pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary there is so little to point at that any critical stabs will miss br br critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth they have no idea what this movie is about good news neither do the filmmakers satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit intellect poetry and genius sadly this movie demonstrates none of these traits,0
1049,i have spent many years studying all the great directors like kurosawa lean fulci deodato peckinpah kubrick and admire them greatly my favourite film is once upon a time in america br br i have only recently become a fan of d'amato and while he was no horror master his films were extreme whether it be soft core hardcore or extreme br br porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy br br joe d'amato wasn't a horror master he's no fulci or bava but however he was a master of erotica no other director could shoot erotic films like him he also never tried making any films outside of these genre's either br br long live joe master of porn and erotica,1
1050,i absolutely loved this movie great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also the calm understated manner of the lead character makes him very likable the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time the bond between and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww2 did not end in 1945 especially in russian occupied countries the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen,1
1051,i don't mind sequels sometimes they're better than the original however many times the originals are best left alone especially when you can't duplicate the cast one of the big reasons the magnificent seven was such a hit was the very popular cast br br this is hardly the magnificent seven when only yul brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in the magnificent seven with six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much lesser known actors this loses its appeal in a hurry in other words except for brynner these guys have no charisma this is a like a championship sports team fielding all substitutes except one br br brynner is good once again fun to watch fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his but the story not just the rest of the crew is lame this movie should never have been made in the original we cared about the seven in here we couldn't care less,0
1052,since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline i won't do it br br however i'd like to restate that interpretation is terrific as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film br br reading the previous comments i've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed in my honest opinion this is far from true br br there are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving ramón and wanting him to stay and understanding his desire to die most obvious of those are the family for instance sister in law never talks for or against euthanasia another such character is the social rights activist who in the last moment tells ramón to re think it all the scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die br br then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia brother is clearly against it as is his father there's only one thing worse than the death of son and it's having a son that wants to die other users have commented that the discussion between ramón and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that ramón is good and the priest is bad well no doubt the scene is comic but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed from my point of view the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince ramón to keep on living using arguments totally alien to thinking the priest's speech goes on the line of god gives and god takes we aren't the owners of our own lives they belong to god and so on the comedy arises from the fact that ramón is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense br br this film is the antithesis of it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his her own opinion and above anything else is a chant of freedom,1
1053,the quality you're likely to remember after viewing the big knife is how claustrophobic it is it's pacing is sacrificed to a uniform texture of dialog it's talky in the extreme modern viewers will feel every point has been made and then some but the movie will still not move on or do the viewer a favor and change the scenery it's very inert at the 45 min mark i was sure i had watched two very slow hours my beleaguered response was good god where is this going it feels like odets was paid by the word br br this is a good place to note the decline of drama from it's high point in the 40s through the conceit laden projects of the 50s and 60s until actual filmic merit was rediscovered in the 70s only to vanish again here we get show offy conventional emotional outbursts from steiger lupino et al and camera moves pre arranged to meet over practiced blocking this is due to the rise of the method the regrettable trend of sacrificing every other merit of film to grant actors their most selfish wishes great acting ho hum has killed thought in movies br br jack palance's forehead pompadour retract and thrust forward every time he reacts to something it's disturbing br br this is awfully boring stuff,0
1054,after just viewing the movie i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen this takes my worst movie award away from komodo which is no easy feat it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name the acting camera work plot script and sound are all awful my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes why was a joke such as this put in the film was the director thinking i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a taffy wrapper another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling why did they even bother to give the film a nc 17 rating were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond,0
1055,wow well you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again i needed one for my brain after watching this movie it literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because i had to take a break and restart my brain to semi normal functionality every so often i mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous they just don't talk and while talking isnt everything and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary and the music is great that was probably the best part but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie so many people give this awesome reviews and for its time i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good but as for the acting or lack thereof it just needed a little something more no shootem ups or sex etc profanity isnt even required but a little more emotion these guys were like stones just sitting there with long faces all in all if you need something to calm yourself down just play the movie dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before just start anywhere lay down and relax it'll put you right to sleep,0
1056,the casting of robert culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film falk and culp were marvellous but as culp was not nemesis this time chemistry was lacking columbo is only as strong as his opposite number and this time he didn't have one,1
1057,this swedish splatter movie tries to parody imitate american horror films such as the evil dead gremlins and others writer director actor cinematographer anders and writer producer actor makeup effects supervisor did i miss something were obviously inspired by sam raimi but the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in the evil dead and elsewhere some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this film but i didn't br br the film rather disturbed than entertained me it tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product just left me with a feeling of oppressiveness although it wasn't scary or shocking at all the combination of different genre elements made this film very strange i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny br br the story is quite inventive except for the showdown at the hospital but i didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above the gore make up effects are considerably good and at least the loose limbs sequences were quite entertaining because in these scenes the film makers didn't try to mix scares and jokes br br all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love rest in pieces evil ed br br my rating 3 10 made me stick to american productions,0
1058,for those that are great fans and collectors of dinosaurs like i am it is not only a very informative series but also puts our imagination to fly colors composition great models and camera angles fantastic photography and filming presentation superb thanks,1
1059,when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry it completely blew in my opinion i didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell let's see i'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff oh noes what is happening oh its a dream oh its not a dream oh wait i see something spooky oh never mind sucky storyline those sequels don't even require the box to be opened or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead the first 3 sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place nothing fantasy nothing weird the box got opened boom they came was the only one that could bargain her way out of it first because of uncle frank then because she had information about the this movie at least attempts to stick to all that even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser no i'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series now they are remaking 1 and i don't even think i will watch it oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed again,0
1060,capt mandolin is an old fashioned hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity and supposedly no americans the story takes place on a greek island during ww2 the italians arrive to take over the island but with german supervision there is a romantic triangle made up of a greek couple and the italian captain nice performances by all the actors penelope cruz's best work yet,1
1061,i will never ever forget watching this show around the age of 13 even at the young age i remember thinking this is a baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes baywatch tolerable the girls in bathing suits nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns on bikes as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously even i knew that the task of going out and acquiring for murder is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day that had been the defining moment of this show simple crimes and situations tailor made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the unsung hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop does not get much dumber,0
1062,one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you'll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me br br the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word br br it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to many aryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and more so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away br br i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz doesn't mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldn't say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing thats if you can get in touch with your darker side,1
1063,this is possibly the worst thing i've ever seen on television first i'm pretty sure it takes itself entirely seriously and i tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire second it displays aristotelian levels of chauvinism in one of the ads for it one of the describes women in terms of quality third every contestant i've seen on it six i think was a dim witted meathead of the variety likely to possess a facebook with boning u or women entered under here for to paraphrase roger ebert this doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel nor deserve mention in the same sentence as barrels the closest thing to a redeeming feature i've experienced with regards to key to the vip was having a female friend reassure me that the male cast were indeed the opposite of attractive in both physical and mental terms,0
1064,from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up i feel the same way it may look like the australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers in this film it was very terrible and too graphic i didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what i read we don't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through it's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier for example mel gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy letters of iwo jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history although i could be wrong except flags of our fathers and bridge of the river kwai you're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill japanese soldiers just read history on the internet mags and in books movies always kill the sense of realization what they did to pows in singapore and the philippines was just dreadful to civilians it just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it,0
1065,the evil that men do begins with a truly repellent torture scene followed a little later by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repellent torture methods that the sadistic heartless villain likes to use but despite the use of such strictly for shock effects the filmmakers can't really cover up the fact that this is just a dull low grade bronson vehicle bronson himself is solid here but he should have chosen a better script,0
1066,john cassavetes is on the run from the law he is at the bottom of the heap he sees negro sidney poitier as his equal and they quickly become friends forming a sort of alliance against a bully of a foreman played by jack warden br br as someone who has worked in a warehouse myself when i was younger i can tell you that the warehouse fights complete with tumbling packing cases and flailing grappling hooks are as realistic as it gets i've been in fights like these myself although no one got killed br br the introduction of sidney poitier's widow is a variation on shakespeare's shylock do i not bleed this is an anti racist film which at the time was much needed br br all the three principle characters warden cassavetes and poitier are superb with warden the most outstanding of the three,1
1067,look this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie she is smokin' hot and a great little actress to boot these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film my friends bob bill and dennis agree lisa is not only brilliant she is a hottie the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard but as soon as lisa hits the screen things really start hopping the others are clearly not in her league this is not the exorcist but as i said if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress this is the one to see,1
1068,this movie was advertised as a comedy but was far more serious than the trailers made it out to be don't get me wrong i enjoyed the movie but was expecting more laughs great performances from robin williams and laura linney worth seeing but don't go expecting to be rolling on the floor the movie left me wondering what it would be like if robin williams character was a real person that was running for president would we elect a comedian i doubt it unfortunately that kind of stark honesty is something greatly lacking today this is a movie that i will be adding to my dvd library as soon as it comes out on dvd the movie has heart,1
1069,follow up to 1965's my name is barbra and shot in brilliant color color me barbra has la streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazy quilt hour of show biz razzle dazzle she's a cut up and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma with her egyptian eye make up and ever changing hairstyles she's also a chameleon her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not one kiss yesterdays the circus sequence isn't as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think the circus medley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting still this is a lively jazzy special not quite as emotionally tantalizing as my name is barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort,1
1070,this film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill this is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new american bomber now much of this plot was repeated in other chan films the jade mask and the docks of new orleans additionally it was first used in mr wong detective all had the exploding glass globes a plot element that obviously has been overused it was interesting in murder over new york but by these later films it was rather passé br br fortunately the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well with a nifty conclusion where of course the culprit reveals himself however no plane could fly the way this one did especially in 1940 such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete plane br br by the way in a small role as a porter you'll see frank coghlan jr the same actor who played billy in the captain marvel serial according to imdb mr is 93 years old and retired from the film industry,1
1071,ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher mirren just to prevent her action against them interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched boring with an ending embarassing just to say the least mrs mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she a good actress no doubt about it could save this garbage i give this a 4 four,0

1073,laura fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life of course oh what jolly japes don't ensue in a britcom flop so day glo bright yet so dismal it manages to make the execrable 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent the sex obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher a former teeny mag who's obviously never watched an episode of smack the pony in his life shame because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were recognisably members of the human race this knicker twisting lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who imagines they're amusing suddenly the thought of new wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive,0
1074,i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to 10 br br all i can say this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview and it was my worst movie experience ever i don't mind the stupid jokes i can live with the silly story but when i see those dumbly grinning main characters with their pseudo foreign speech only germans will understand what i talk about i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of if they had left them out the thing may actually have been acceptable br br there's not much more to be said about this one you may laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous but that doesn't make it any better it is definitely not funny br br if you live outside of germany be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas br br if you do live in germany avoid this movie at all costs,0
1075,after reading more than my fair share of reviews for a vast number of different movies i have noticed a certain trend people judge to harshly on what the expected to see i figure if you go into a movie open minded not expecting anything certain than you will have better feelings towards it then if you try and watch but have pre created standards you want it to reach br br since i try not to be hypocritical i watched this movie with a very clean slate and open mind and was very much pleased since it is not a mainstream title or award winning for that matter i did not know quite what to expect but in all truth i enjoyed it a good deal more than ninja scroll lovely animation deep story and the always joyful ninja hack n slashing combined extremely well to one of my personal favorite animes ever made br br i am not promising that you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you may come out with a pleasant surprise br br before speaking be sure of what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence chinese proverb,1
1076,comments must've been written on topsy turvy day because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth br br eighth wife' is hilarious in every scene in every way the chemistry between colbert and cooper could not have been finer supporting cast is superb br br writing and direction are magnificent br br like so many other comments on this board again i lament why can't films be like this anymore br br this is classic paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best folks,1
1077,thank goodness not all dutch people are that ruthless i think jason is being judged like that by most people simply because he has a famous father maybe he's not as great as some of those actors but he's definitely not as bad as suggested br br i watched the movie some years ago and i actually loved it i knew jason from other movies and of course robin of sherwood but i must say i really liked his acting from this movie on it was really good br br during the movie i actually forgot he was the son of sean who br br and if you're a shakespeare lover i can recommend this movie i'm sure you'll enjoy it,1
1078,this movie is crappy beyond any limits it's incredible a very bad ripoff from jaws and other better shark movies a really bad one everything is really pathetic the story is purest crap actors are bad effects very cheap no creativity whatsoever it looks like some really children took jaws script and arranged it randomly then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors the music is really inappropriate just some elevator music bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed again listens to very loud elevator music carlo maria the author should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy any scene which is supposed to be thrilling there is one major difference to jaws though in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite well there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite when this does not work guys take an big load of dynamite and spent like 1 4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship i would guess bismarck class of battleship or to dig another panama channel this is just incredible i'm glad they did not try to use napalm flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad bad approximately 2 m shark well there is mystic disappearing native indian who looks like german pensioner too in this mess this is not a movie this is a warning example how bad the movies may be as a warning it is useful but the public should be protected from this crap most of italian movies is bad but this this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word,0
1079,have wanted to see this for a while i never thought i'd be watching it in a damp square london with 15 000 other people and all to a new score by the pet shop boys br br quickly that experience specifically a new departure from it seemed to suffer from the same problem the hugo wolf had when he wrote his opera der corregidor the long structure was a chain of short ones i e songs produced a more fluid integrated score although it was quite static on its own terms neither could they resist song a setting of the subtitled text worked in this respect a free standing meditation on the action of the odessa steps massacre during the action of that sequence itself was i'd go so far to say counterproductive overall it was very exciting though which is surely what eisenstein was trying to achieve br br it is a very exciting film with editing taking the place of acceleration of tension or action in fact the film though beautifully shot and passionately acted it has a silent film melodrama but not in the excess of the hollywood comic style breathes through its careful editing pacing specific shots with a sense of the rate at which the audience will take them in and there's a huge range of perspective too either he had a lot of cameras or the sequences on the harbor and steps took a great deal of time br br super film which can be assessed irrespective of sound as that's how the finished product would have been conceived 8 10,1
1080,the movie seemed a little slow at first but it picked up speed and got right to the point it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget i enjoyed it it is very close to reality as any movie about the atomic bombs that were to be dropped on japan i have recommended it to friends i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz,1
1081,okay granted i am a fan of low budget horror which along with it does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to trancers 6 directed by jay br br first of all the trancers series started back in the mid 80s by charlie band and his empire pictures is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth well low and behold due to the sinking budgets of full moon features which despite what people have said have actually brought along very high quality features such as hell asylum and dead rotting thomerson did not return for the sixth installment br br full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another below average screenplay which features jack deth played by thomerson in flashbacks which are extremely poorly inserted he has a different hair style like every time he is shown and some laying on a table going down the line into his daughter's body well from here on out you have jo deth acting like jack but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as jack deth did br br the film shot on 16mm is simply put an embarrassment to the trancers name no offense to anyone at young wolf productions i mean i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim but with a little more time despite it being filmed since december of 2001 it could have been better br br however check out full moon's dvd of it which is a double feature with the original trancers and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features br br overall i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the trancers name but like anything you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself,0
1082,while the camerawork was certainly funky perhaps one dutch roll short of stoned the premise of the film was fantastic it really took a scathingly satirical in the true traditional of hal hartley look at god jesus and devil the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes even the monologues of jesus were great this was by far the best jesus i've even seen so zen like son of god ish but still such a nice guy on one level this is a very general look on the paradoxes of christianity but yet there is still a personal level where you can relate to jesus christ without having a god complex thanx to martin donovan and hal hartley,1
1083,any film school student could made a film 1 000 times better than piece of garbage as someone who had read the book i expected even a straight re telling of the book would make this a fair film there was a chance that a talented director could go beyond narrative and make a great film br br well the director did go beyond narrative he added a hip hispanic angel named that was not in the book he had bob woodward interview the dead belushi in an exchange in the morgue the film had all the insight of someone stoned on pcp staring at his navel br br if this is a spoiler to you you will thank me for it because it is absolutely the worst movie ever made,0
1084,i love this movie it focuses on both issues reality and fantasy reality because hey we all wanted a date from that popular guy billy and some of us haven't been kissed yet right be honest br br another real issue is because of the pain people gain from teasing and whoa high school life remember it the fantasy is finding your true love when you're 25 and still in high school not really fantasy but close enough br br although some parts are unbelievable it was a great movie there are no other words to describe such incredible work and the story was wonderful drew barrymore did a charmingly wonderful job same as the hilarious david arquette the people who worked in the movie are all wonderful didn't i just repeat that br br never been kissed is one of the movies that the later generations should watch it shows reality and some not issues for people like you and me,1
1085,i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film 9 5 unfortunately it looks like i am not alone br br the film is slow and boring really one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high br br unfortunately this was not the case so when watching the film and seeing the poor story and acting i am left giving it a 3 10 score br br vinnie jones is superb in lock stock and also snatch and he plays a great hard man however he should stick to this role its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films they just don't work br br neither can he play lead actor he plays better as supporting or otherwise when he plays lead his acting talents are too 'in view' and shown up as not really very good mean machine is another good example of this,0
1086,but i laughed a lot br br i saw et les at a public screening during the world cup the sound was lousy it was too bright to see the screen properly but i still enjoyed myself immensely the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor abba all not very witty but in good tradition some very good jokes but also some that not everybody seemed to get br br the only thing i didn't like were the voices of and in the german version at least the voice actors are very well known around here which was the only reason they were casted really they don't fit the characters at all br br all in all a good way to spend some time and if it's free like in my case all the better and to have a couple of laughs 8 out of 10,1
1087,uproarious no brainer comedy in which comedian mark blankfield portrays jekyll as an uptight doctor deeply committed to his research once he's his experimental formula he's turned into the scenery devouring hyde causing no end of problems for everybody around him br br i was pleasantly surprised by this one it has a truly insane madcap approach it's full steam ahead with one outrageously stupid yet undeniably hilarious joke after another funny lines and sight gags are in abundance blankfield plays each role for all it's worth one highlight has hyde bursting into song hyde's got nothing to hyde is quite catchy and even now i can still hear it in my head the climax even goes so far as to spoof old b w horror films br br the supporting cast is quite spirited as well with bess armstrong as the ditzy fiancée mary krista as the spunky ivy and tim thomerson as flamboyant fellow doctor i do wish more could have been done with character as i'm a fan of the man but it's always nice to see him in something br br a large array of familiar faces parade before the camera cassandra elvira peterson peter liz sheridan george wendt michael ensign john dennis johnston art la lin shaye and george chakiris in a cameo as himself br br it goes without saying that if you prefer highbrow intelligent comedy you'd better avoid this one at all costs but for those who enjoy a zany politically incorrect gleefully raunchy good time this just might do the trick br br one of the best bits is saved for last br br 8 10,1
1088,i saw the movie in as the closing film of film festival i didn't know anything about it but right now i'm glad i didn't refuse the chance to see ding a ling less it is one of the funniest movies i've ever watched and believe me i've seen zillions of movies i'm a film critic clever script and dialogs smart details what else can i say an indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor one can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now ding a ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director is more mature now i heard that his next feature will be a political satire and i really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like house of pancakes,1
1089,may be spoilers no doubt one of the best dramas if not the best in the genre i've ever seen is an alien or just a crazy bugger this is the question you'll be asking yourself all throughout the movie br br kevin spacey is simply amazing as is jeff bridges you can't beat this kind of acting plus some humour at times some of kevin actions in this movie are very funny when he was up in the tree for example and when he was talking to the queen mental patient the way he hid half his face around the wall and just stared br br to simply put it right from the start you'll be hooked and if you really love drama's you won't be dissapointed br br a solid 85,1
1090,i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs good acting and good plot sadly i got none of those things br br first off this show is completely unrealistic how can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip awesome location and barely any rules plus a sushi bar a sushi bar no school has a sushi bar and what's up with the huge ultra cool ultra hip dorm rooms this doesn't happen in boarding schools everyone in this show seems to be perfect zoey looks perfect has the perfect friends never has to do homework and is super popular sounds more like a villain to me i hate how they use so many cliques in this show example dana the skater chick she is completely ignorant and wears edgy clothes the jokes are old sooooo old too i wouldn't watch this show if i were you it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon rating 1 10,0
1091,thorn bmi is out of business before they stopped making films they made a chiller of a movie using e s p and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power only in the death of her father did olivia find that her father dubbed from had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of vampirism br br our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons pulling in and music to match the discovery of the 6 girls dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet in the walls were all kinds of objects the men were pulling up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only made the film more bizarre br br if you like extremely chilling scenes this for you unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of decay don't view it without a friendly companion like the changeling it has some heart stopping horror in it i gave this a rating of 7 it's in color actress meg tilly debuted in this film if you can find it see it,1
1092,i speak badly of g i j t m mostly because i think it lacked something that g i joe had yes it had something that g i joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson and burgess meredith but i think g i joe the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g i joe tv series had most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i m h o br br although violence is what g i joe was built on i'd say that striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie character to go out neither was seeing remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra la felt was rightfully theirs br br it wasn't the best way for the g i joe series to go out but it's better than nothing,0
1093,i don't normally go out of my way to watch romantic comedy and maybe i will in the future after seeing return to me the plot was simple and no secret after the publicity you don't have to be einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes what you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the chemistry abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have a good time i love this movie and have the dvd on order,1
1094,checking out will be released friday september 15th 2006 through the amc theater chain starting in new york city times square and 3rd ave west street this film has been one from the heart for the heart mark lane jon karas richard marcus jeff hare dana matt jensen ed abrams nick pike peter falk laura san giacomo david paymer judge reinhold all the cast and crew knew from day one that this film was something special the need to comfort the elderly is intended the closeness of family is more apparent now then ever i would recommend this film to all ages and races this story rings the truth to anyone with or without family,1
1095,jack webb's movie 'the d i' came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several trainees in a swamp in paris isle in the 50's as always webb being the patriot that he is came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows i actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards i served in the army and can understand the intensity of the training at parris island camp death by some so this movie can never come close as does 'full metal jacket' i think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual but again think of the time period it was made 1957 and what could be allowed and said on film at that time i have always found jack webb to be clean cut and very loyal i know many have criticized the film as one sided and government propaganda if you feel this way watch 'full metal jacket' with r lee ermey i am a webb fan and enjoy the movie for it's merit not accuracy as i have said webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards lapd dragnet adam 12 emergency etc just sit back and enjoy this one from a very strict moral time period in this country don't be too judgemental of mr webb mark lockwood texas,1
1096,do not rent this movie i ended up buying the previously viewed tape of this for 4 00 that was close to the price of a rental so thought i might as well buy it i'm tossing it out after i finish this review the movie which stars lowe is a music video with few lines of dialogue slow moving shots and poorly done editing i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick which is what i wanted to see i didn't even get that this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots no script close ups terrible edited and a poorly developed plot i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters by the end of the movie we still don't even really know who they are believe the hype stay away,0
1097,death camp opera right here right now br br ten years ago i read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society a certain peter was the author his picture was acted by some non professional actors citizens like you and me and others the violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic was it a movie a documentary both actually br br over the years i realized how hard it was to find it maybe i would by coincidence anyway it's yet an old story i saw it a short while ago totally impressing my very favourite peace of art punishment park is its name i love this docu fiction this this what ever after all the shock movies i saw i reach the best with this strong and intense i found a masterpiece there is enough on the net to know many things about the movie it is even to buy on dvd with additional stuff the only words i want to add is about my own experience with this film i can only trust such a sincere and engaged peace of art about people and for people those who direct act or watch a cinema which is simply a real human experience within an art or the opposite br br so i'm not talking about all the we can see on tv especially the show' whom the concepts of people playing them selves are interesting but used in a stupid and perverse way in punishment park we can see some real individuals living as they are we only put them in a very specific context with a few lines to follow and we let them be what they want to be it's a kind of therapy a way of for those inside the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens then to end the director's touch edits a short and sweet apocalypse movie a desperate scream a 'death camp opera' where some folks are on the run after virulent trials punishment park is for those who want to grow see this film and have the opportunity to choose your own morality grow up and yourself with it if you can feel it if you can see it in my case punishment park is stuck in me for ever with all my love consciousness and will,1
1098,kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most amazing books i have read in the recent past i perhaps had very high expectations from the film but none the less the movie was good the entire setting seemed realistic nothing was made to fancy the dialogs were not very attractive or powerful they were just right the movie was not a bad experience at all especially at the last 15mins where it got real emotional and even the hardest man would probably cry but my imagination was far better than the movie i cried more upon reading the novel than seeing the movie but overall a good movie to see for those of u who are not readers but the readers the novel would be a better experience so if at all u want to see the movie read the novel first and then compare it to the movie,1
1099,have you ever wondered what its like to feel free i am sure that each one of us know the meaning of freedom and never seriously think of using it to our advantage hari om shows the audience what freedom actually means in this film freedom is described in the form of style represented by discovery of india discovers her inner true love when she is in a rickshaw journey with mr hari om she looks at life differently and portrays freedom that every woman restricts in herself when she is in a relationship br br this film is definitely worth a watch and i saw this the first time in dubai international film festival and i left the cinema hall with complete satisfaction br br watch it,1
1100,i honestly fail to understand why people love this show so much a friend of mine watches this and since i like sci fi i tried to watch along since the plot of the show sounded promising but in truth it really is a very boring show the only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the video game like cgi effects and the complete overuse of muppets note that i call it muppets because they actually really look like muppets not like the aliens they should be br br speaking of which the muppets and make up effects are horribly overused in this show you have this guy who could be best described as a alien dwarf hybrid you have a pale girl who looks like a cheesy vamp girl you've got a floating potty mouth frog alien it just feels very unnecessary and furthermore even to the point that you feel distracted from the whole storyline about a lost astronaut br br every episode is also too much of a stand alone the creators of this show directed this in such a way that every episode almost feels like a whole other show at least up until the point that you see the main characters muppets again that is the whole plot about the main character getting back to earth is way to much pushed to the background at points the acting is also quite bad br br conclusion if you want good sci fi just look somewhere else this isn't even real sci fi to begin with in my opinion since the show is more aimed at fantasy elements with all the puppetry and weird dreams going on and if you just want to see muppets then i suggest you watch the muppet show and feel glad that this abomination of a show has come to a end br br by the way doesn't anyone have with the concept of a living spaceship thats right doctor who started that concept almost about 30 years ago this show is like a collection of 'sci fi' leftovers scripts and events that were abandoned for a good reason only to be picked up by this horrible show,0
1101,i went to see this movie with a lady of mine who doesn't like heist movies but she enjoyed it i missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through it is a story about edward norton and a crew stealing some gold and norton deciding he wants it all to himself then the people he betrayed want to get back at him it is a well put together funny and action packed film that i need to see again the whole way through one of my top movies of the summer so far br br a big help to the entertainment factor is seth green i dont know anyone who doesnt like seth green and he adds to the flavor he plays a guy who says he created and his stole it from him he is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch br br it was said that norton didn't want to do this film but if i were him i would have wanted to sign on br br the only problem is that it is very predictable any movie go er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening before it happens br br my biggest complaint with the film is eddie nortons choice of facial hair the thick yet thin mustache and a small pike on his chin he looks like an 80's porn star for gods sake,1
1102,for connoisseurs of bad movies galaxina is a true gem with truly horrid dialog acting and directing it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre it's priceless for a good laugh in particular the scenes involving the harley davidson worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh br br sadly the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver but since she's playing an android i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting br br bad movie lovers don't pass this one up,0
1103,this movie was well done it covers the difficulties a returning vietnam veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity i was in vietnam and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it the offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in leavenworth br br the notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism the biggest problem was coming home to learn that many americans were opposed to the war that is what caused many veterans to feel they had taken part in something less than honorable not the manner in which they served br br the ending depicted the father acting more as a belligerent bully than a loving caring father for that i gave it a 7 out of 10 had the ending allowed for a degree of acceptance i could have rated it a 9 br br most decent men will come home from war with guilt and emotional scars they need acceptance and understanding to overcome that i pray that the public is more understanding of our present day veterans than it was in the the vietnam era,1
1104,altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other because he says people do that in life well people also cough burp go off on tangents etc the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema that's one issue br br the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire in 1988 or 2004 garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60s style hippie liberal i mean the guy still trots out in his strip a character that is a complete anachronism yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youth br br don't get me wrong i am a conservative but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant but it's not it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals including the odious repellent ron reagan jr at times it feels unscripted and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self importance and aren't we oh so clever ness br br someone said that this show insists it has a cult following i think its cult status is more wished for than actual i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them but if that is the standard then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree if tanner didn't have the names altman and trudeau attached it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s instead it's presented as hard hitting incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game the reality however is about as far from that as possible pat paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was and he's been dead for a decade,0
1105,with the obvious exception of fools horses this was in my opinion david jason's finest series br br coming straight after his tv debut on 'do not adjust your set ' these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days by comparison porridge open all hours and that awful series 'lucky man' did not come close br br i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest shame on him a new generation deserves to enjoy this the series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'the brothers' which aired on bbc at the same time before vcrs were commonplace br br btw i have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant spencer was played by mark eden alan bradley off coronation street i am amazed he didn't try to murder edgar briggs,1
1106,after all these years i am puzzled as to why julie brown west coast isn't a household name or a hugely famous comedic star she is one of the funniest females on the planet in this spoof she takes on madonna who is one of her favorite targets she is medusa a hugely successful singer like madonna who also happened to have documentary truth or dare julie brown spoofs madonna as medusa who came from wisconsin the land of dairy and beer i remember the segment where she went to wisconsin to visit her family and a grave i don't remember if it was a parent or her pet i remember somebody saying that medusa did nothing original she was just copying others i have to say that i hope this spoof documentary is available on dvd somewhere julie brown was at her best mocking and spoofing others,1
1107,this is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a it may have some long term significance as a snapshot of 1950s us thinking but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline wooden acting and grating style there are some interesting photos of long gone aircraft but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length,0
1108,in wwii america has developed a brand new huge bomber plane lois lane and clark kent go to cover the story when the plane is going on its first mission lois stows away on the plane before it takes off there are also some japanese saboteurs on board who have every intention of flying the bomber to tokyo will lois be able to warn superman what do you think br br fast moving colorful cartoon the animation is a little jerky but much better than anything we see today the color and sound have been beautifully restored just two problems the lousy music score and the racism especially in the title that aside this is pretty good an 8,1
1109,my guide for the quality of the a movie is if i'm still thinking about it after leaving the theater i'm still thinking about this one the next day which doesn't happen often br br the scenery a reasonable guess for 16th century italy costumes lighting cinematography are all excellent it is a beautiful film visually br br characters can never rise above the script they must recite but these actors made the most of their material which is excellent this is one of shakespeare's best plays which people will still enjoy another 400 years down the road all of the principals were interesting and enjoyable br br those who say this is anti semitic must be deaf and blind if anything it is anti 16th century catholic while shylock plays a man controlled and tortured by the hurts he has suffered it is clear that the society in which he lives is largely to blame the script clearly places his personal responsibility where it belongs as well br br a great film,1
1110,sweeping and still impressive early talkie western of pioneering days other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered wagon 1923 the iron horse 1924 and cimarron 1931  none of which i've watched though i do have the latter on vhs it was simultaneously filmed in the standard fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called grandeur but only the former has been released on the bare bones fox dvd one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio but the careful framing  not to mention the splendid cinematography  is evident enough even in the standard version br br young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead a role which however didn't lead to the expected stardom  as he'd languish in 'b' westerns for the best part of the next decade before john ford came to his rescue with stagecoach 1939 anyway he and marguerite churchill from dracula's daughter 1936 make a nice couple  despite her somewhat tedious character supporting characters include a variety of stock types veteran westerner comic relief sidekick with a penchant for making noises with his mouth burly and uncouth villain played by tyrone power sr his two slimy cohorts a mexican and a southerner the latter also filling in as wayne's rival for churchill's hand etc also among the members of the wagon party is a timid swede full of optimism for the promised land but who's continually put down by his irascible mother in law and later wayne regular ward bond br br the episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball lyrical and action packed vignettes  as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements the indians and themselves the film however has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality also the editing is somewhat choppy particularly during the second half  little wonder since the dvd edition of the film is only 108 minutes long against the complete 158 minute grandeur version,1
1111,i like movies about quirky people one flew over the cuckoo's nest is maybe my all time favorite so one can imagine i had a blast with this one it's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling this movie is unpredictable and intense some scenes are downright frightening even after multiple viewings because this kind of stuff really can happen it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride and after you see the ending if you're not deeply disturbed you really should check yourself for a pulse br br the acting was phenomenal marcy with her rather extreme case of tourette's shifts from quirky cute to utterly terrifying sometimes appearing so out of control that she looks like the undead seth was great too the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character br br it's a classic love story with some unconventional twists and it's also my favorite love story next to true romance there are two bad reviews for it up here but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something normal or lighthearted this one is messed up and indie as can be and won't let you go until the heavy climax,1
1112,i've just watched this with my three children boy boy and girl and this film was good old fashioned family action adventure although definitely aimed at the kid market i'd say 5 to 13 it was certainly watchable and as a parent it is a pleasure to find a movie that appeals to a broad range of ages whilst still being suitable for the whole family to watch particularly younger children br br the story revolves around ricky a bit of a nerd with a vivid imagination this can definitely be seen in his daydream sequences who foils a kidnapping and major art theft while on on board a flight to washington for a school trip ricky's dad is an airplane mechanic so ricky not only knows the structure of the aircraft inside out but is also a top gun on his computer flight simulator this comes in handy when the pilot and co pilot are out cold through a series of misadventures and there is no one left to fly the plane i don't want to give away any more of the plot,1
1113,i caught this movie the other night on one of the movie channels and i haven't laughed that hard in a long time this movie was so funny i went out and bought the very next day i love this type of comedy it just seemed so real in the way the actors react to the different situations here i was rollin i had never even heard of it and just started watching because of the title seeing other people the title caused me to give it a shot and i'm glad i did i laughed so hard that it hurt now it's part of my collection i definitely recommend it to all those that enjoy smart ass type of comedy i will be watching this one over and over,1
1114,black vengeance is an alternate title for ying hung ho aka tragic hero 1987 i have just seen this on vhs together with the first part of the story gong woo ching rich and famous also 1987 the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4 dvd set of movies starring rod perry the black gestapo fred williamson black cobra 2 richard lawson black fist the fourth movie is called the black six strangely while the characters retain their original names in rich and famous in black vengeance chow yun character is named eddie shaw alex man man leung is harry and andy lau is called johnny also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films perhaps that was the year they were american dubbed according to the release dates given on imdb tragic hero was released before rich and famous was there any reason for releasing the sequel first despite some comments i enjoyed these films although they aren't among best such as the killer and hard boiled which are truly astonishing however if one day i come across a 2 dvd set of rich and famous and tragic hero i won't hesitate to buy it hopefully these comments about black vengeance clear up which was also for me a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yun filmography,0
1115,this film has to rank down there with ed wood films a terrible script and bad bad acting br br a machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover not one window ever breaks you'd think after a fire fight like that the big u haul truck might be riddled not a scratch br br do cia agents and government contractors shout top secret information at a stand up cocktail party with hundreds of people around br br there isn't one actor you care about everyone is shallow and basically unlikable br br a hawaii bound 747 flies out of los angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the pacific in 100 feet of water a short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left on a 747 br br the next day the rescue teams show up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive br br a movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse br br,0
1116,this movie should go down in the annals of as one of the worst of all time i will stop short of saying it's the worst movie ever only because i have yet to see every movie ever made i cannot make such lofty claims until then the story is stale the acting is horrible at best the special effects are no more than a couple of lbs of dry ice and a fan somebody must have been related to someone to get this movie made mr busey mailed this one in the dog is well trained and cute making it the only redeeming quality in this never should have made it movie two hours and 3 of my life i will never get back,0
1117,john leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it john tells the story of how he grew up probably some fact and fiction and adds hilarious stories in the midst if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best,1
1118,this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly br br this was on odd film i liked the adventure of it though it seems to be aimed at children spoiler ahead ironically the main character murders a federal official then he's a fugitive on the run they later blow up his house and then he finally commits suicide seems like they should have just made it a film for a more mature audience or made it more family friendly,1
1119,i spent many a sleepless night after watching 2001 not only because of the psychological horror of which 2001 is a masterpiece but also because of the way it brought me a restless soul some clarity to the way i observe the universe it changed my way of thinking in a very profound way and after reading the novel by arthur c clarke i found myself once again inspired a writer as i am by the level of imagination br br the space odyssey is not something one can just go and see one has to be ready for it or it cannot be understood in fact i don't think it can be understood at all at least not all of it at once it is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring by richard strauss and 'blue danube' by strauss br br take all the time you want but eventually you are going to have to see this film if it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me it can certainly do it for you as well br br or maybe i'm just plain crazy,1
1120,i had the opportunity to see this last evening at a local film festival herzog introduced the film and did an hour long q a afterward br br this is a brilliantly done documentary herzog explained afterward that he does not consider his films to be true documentary since facts sometimes camouflage the truth instead he scripts some scenes and ad libs some to introduce a new element that may have been missed if he followed the original story outline br br little dieter unlike timothy is a real person that you fall in love with you cheer for him you feel the anguish that he feels you admire the sense of humor and joy for life that he exhibited here 30 years after he was taken into captivity by the viet cong you are disappointed to hear afterward that dieter passed on not too long ago br br as in most herzog films the imagery is breathtakingly beautiful with a wonderful choice of background music especially a scene of battle taken from archives of the viet nam war but fitting the story line of dieter br br the core of the film has dieter return to the hellish jungle where he was a pow and he re enacts his journey with some locals harrowing for us to watch i can't imagine what he felt as he was bound again br br one of the better films to depict and discuss the nightmare of the viet nam war it should serve as a lesson to us all,1
1121,the fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame but back in the 1940s that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to black audiences due to segregation so while mgm warner and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had and from seeing this movie it's obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking some of the actors weren't particularly good especially the french guy the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly but the film also had some good music of varying styles from classical to jazz to rhythm and blues this is thanks to many talented but pretty much unrecognized black performers br br now as for the plot it was totally stupid and silly but still watchable in a kitschy way i loved seeing tim moore from the amos 'n andy tv show in drag as he made the absolute ugliest woman in cinema history this includes the bride of frankenstein and many others this is probably due to the fact that when not in drag he was a pretty ugly but funny guy if the man pretending to be a woman actually looked remotely like a woman i doubt this movie would have worked as well seeing this ugly and rubber faced man with a cheesy wig still being ardently sought after by three suitors was pretty funny br br this isn't a great film but from a historical point of view it's fascinating and excellent viewing for young adults to know what america was like for blacks in this era a very interesting and funny time capsule,0
1122,latter days is a very very independent movie and compared to many of today's more modern films it's lacking on many parts the shooting seems at times quite amateurish the dialogues can be a bit chopped up and the characters are not impressively complex so don't have too high hopes for this movie because as i've said it's very independent but whatever it lacks in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the story's charm i cannot claim that the plot is outstandingly original but the story is still beautiful and heart warming in many ways it's not about being gay versus being straight it's about faith and how you decide to run your own life it's a silly story that makes you want to both cry and smile at the same time so to be honest latter days is far from perfect but i truly loved the movie and i highly recommend it it's very critical towards the religious aspects of our society and there is homosexuality involved but approach it with an open mind and i'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as myself,1
1123,this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life i'm approaching 47 the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their acting i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach i suppose that home video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub standard the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning as were the actors faces which brings me to the topic make up by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen magazines my first own make up or similar what made me buy the dvd was the name lovecraft printed on the cover the only connection with this brilliant mind's works was the use of the name necronomicon which was wrongly translated as book of light the 4 70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado,0
1124,this is the sequel to octopus br br pff ok a lot of stock footage but pretty good i'm surprised that they actually had a giant robot octopus that actually didn't look that bad i was actually quite surprised by that br br the movie overall was just ok fun it never explained how the octopus got so big and isn't linked it anyway to the first but it was still fun br br the ending me and my friend laughed at basically after blowing the octopus up once the two main characters launch a bomb and five explosions most stock footage appear on screen we joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a 'five missiles in one' toy believe me it has to be seen to believe overall just stupid fun worth giving a chance buying if it's cheap,0
1125,i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse' drive in cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets i am growing to love many of crown movies especially the creepy erotic psychological thrillers br br death machines is not one of them br br after seeing movies like malibu beach the creeping terror and the pink angels it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made but it doesn't have much going for it br br no plot really no story to speak of br br the acting isn't evident  only the actor responsible for the terribly played tony with the thick fake italian accent made any attempt to get into character br br the score is annoying and pedantic br br the only thing about this movie is why what compelled the film makers to make this film br br did they think the story of 1 three ninjas 2 two competing crime bosses 3 an ancillary bartender karate school student character and 4 his pitiful love interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made br br this is a complete waste of time and money for you me the producers writers actors and the director,0
1126,who will love my children saddest movie i have ever seen definite 10 10 released on tv in 1983 movie has been released on vhs dvd release is a must sooner rather than later mother dying of cancer must find homes for all her children before she dies because her thoughts are that her husband and father of the kids is not capable of caring for them once she has died she manages to find homes for the children except one a young boy whom is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy very sad when your not wanted in for a real good tear jerker get your hands on this movie i'm a male even i cried when i watched this movie not to be missed,1
1127,one of the worst films i have ever seen after watching it i walk out like what happened i am confused to this day can someone explain that movie to me please both the acting and picture quality are so bad you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder first i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie because it's unbelievably bad movie this movie isn't scary at all there is even no typical horror clichés too the plot and acting of this movie was terrible it's not fantastic surrealistic or horror it's just hideously bad turkish feature film and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters when i watch i fell into so hopeless so sad for young turkish movie maker please please don't make 'cinema' like this,0
1128,two actors play rival gangsters in three films the final of which is a sci fi film that nods strangely to william s burroughs philip k dick and anime all at once the robots are actually called a reference to dicks blade runner several visual allusions to the film can be found as well and the bad guy is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through use of a compulsory drug for heterosexual love is fleeting and homosexual love is eternal martial arts fights ensue a first for the dead or alive films the hilarious climax involves the two leads morphing into a winged robot with a gigantic phallus for a head who personifies destruction which has been the path of both characters thus far their individual minds and later literal heads functioning as something like testicles the film ends with the mayor f ing his free jazz playing boy lackey as the robot apparently tears down a wall around them the last words of the mayor oh f followed by a quick fade to black part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly i was just laughing a lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow takashi miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of gozu reinforces this theme more than any other sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like who the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala naked lunch miike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect,1
1129,the first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot exposition after an early brief sequence of las vegas being hit by tornadoes the action doesn't really start until the second two hours still some character relationships don't become clear until the second part the actors turn in competent performances but nothing special however better than those in aftershock earthquake in new york an exception is randy quaid whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying the plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of independence day speed the day after tomorrow earthquake the towering inferno and several other films you can predict what will happen next and come close to predicting the dialog word for word the special effects are unbelievably bad despite the effects in twister the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in the wizard of oz and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as csi and cold case spend on the totality of a single episode if you have to see a made for tv disaster film see the day after asteroid or special bulletin instead you'll get better plots acting and effects,0
1130,love jones cleverly portrays young african american men and women in a clear positive realistic sense i feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood long and larenz tate worked well together and i hope to see more work from the two of them as a matter of fact all of the actors actresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them this movie can be compared to most any well written romantic comedy if you have not seen this movie already i strongly recommend that you do it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love,1
1131,maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here i have a database of all the dvds i own including those received as gifts which this was and so when entering a new one i always refer to imdb for such info as genre runtime director leads etc when entering this i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh well it was neither there were absolutely no laughs at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous profanity are there really radio announcers allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones dishes out what if a decent child happened to tune to his station br br rather than enjoy a good laugh or even a little giggle i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing i have given it 3 out of 10 but to be honest i don't know what those 3 are for i suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't too bad br br we have an ostensibly stone broke loser giovanni ribisi who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car who pays for the fuel and live in what could be a nice apartment who pays his rent given the opportunity of forming what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl he even blew that perhaps it was she lynn collins who earned this movie the 3 points the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two weeks' hairdressing br br unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth forget it,0
1132,don't believe the hype if you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree you may be disappointed even the hilarious and talented steve carrell can't save this poorly written over long silly spy flick for the purists fans of the original tv series this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence agent 99 and maxwell except for their names are simply not the same characters there are several isolated references to the original but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the tv version for those not familiar with the original tv series you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored there are a few cheap hollywood political shots as well really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year we left after the first hour and weren't alone some left after 20 minutes,0
1133,the film version of came out two years after the television series ended like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened i came away bitterly disappointed eric could not have spent very much time writing the script most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes at the time of the film's release the series was still being repeated regularly on i t v so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already at least the 'on the movies boasted original screenplays br br secondly richard beckinsale had died the year before so they eliminated the character of as a mark of respect substituting art student 'john' played by christopher of 'only when i fame it simply wasn't the same br br as another poster has pointed out boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series being bigger and altogether cleaner br br director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'casino royale' a film steeped in surreal humour also has its share of 'walter style fantasy sequences such as the 'saturday night parody personally i found them horribly out of place a case of 'over egging the br br on the plus side leonard is as magnificent as ever as the seedy as are frances de la tour as and don as its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents br br when died in 1984 it was shown by i t v as a tribute with its final scene showing laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs removed in the interests of good taste,0
1134,isabelle huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation la pianiste truly confirms it as if that wasn't enough annie girardot plays her mother and annie girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation so as you may well imagine those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through isabelle and annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen a mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes i was unable even to blink or to breath personally i don't believe in the director's intentions i don't believe they the intentions that is go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but i was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational huppert and the fierceness of strength i highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me you can't afford to miss la pianiste,1
1135,closet land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors nothing more or less happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official the setting is minimalist this might be considered soft core s m porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time place and political context since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment the abuse becomes purely personal the pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman we come away disturbed but having learned nothing br br what is the point that torture exists in the world that abusing prisoners is bad that dictatorships abuse innocent people we know that already closet land has echoes of such works as darkness at noon and but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning this work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric a definite thumbs down,0
1136,the quote above just about says it all for slipstream i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance i won't watch it again so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie i'm sure it will set a record br br some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry paxton's character has hijacked hamill's prisoner an android taking his name from the poet byron bob peck hamill shoots owens paxton with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion kitty aldridge can keep tabs on the pair the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the br br if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense then i suppose you'll find something of interest here but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with all over his torso if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here you're really stretching br br patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming the end to come into view alas even that was denied if beauty is in the eye of the beholder then so is understanding this movie had neither yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons apparently the film was keeping them afloat,0
1137,this movie is too stupid for words even if you consider it to be a parody on movie making if you consider it to be completely camp even than you're wasting your time watching it for you've seen it a hundred times before but maybe you are a big fan of high shrieking girl voices you're still loving barbie and ken and you can stand this typical '80s electric guitar background noise well than you'll have a chance,0
1138,the paul of death wish 3 is very far removed from the paul of the original film if you remember the 1974 film then you will remember was a during the korean war and that he was physically sick after he committed his first execution ten years later seems to have learned unarmed combat and how to handle anti tank weapons in his spare time but i ll overlook that gaffe because is the best of the sequels lowlife scum bags get shot dead burned alive their teeth smashed and thrown to their deaths by middle aged housewives armed with sweeping brushes yeah i know the gang members are multi ethnic and for that they deserve some credit but even if they re not racist they re still murdering scum who deserve all they get from and the innocent citizens who needs mayor rudy when you ve got paul an anti tank rocket and a bunch of old age to reclaim the streets from the criminal creeps paul i salute you sir,1
1139,when i first watched this film i thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time he gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the work he is the only good thing in it you're into explosions and american dream working class hero trash which i'm not br br i don't get it how can this film get away with being so that bit with the little boy being rescued i mean come on you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire guy wearing any goggles i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment he'd have choked after 2 minutes this film was just bad ok br br why robert br br sorry if this is your favourite film,0
1140,i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot,0
1141,i can't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme totally unrealistic they seemed to want it to be highly realistic but all the elements are based on clichés real propaganda stuff after seeing this an addict probably just want to continue his her career i gave it 2,0
1142,is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time if however you love bad films see this at all costs,0
1143,about the spoiler warning it's not may contain it does contain spoilers readers beware br br okay first i need it to be known that i'm not bashing the actors they're just working with what they're given the problem was the script it was horrendous there was nothing believable about it at all sure when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific movie worthy situation but these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision the only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car speaking of hitting her with a car why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person also does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood frankly it wasn't suspenseful either the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were well this rant has gone on way longer than i meant to for such a bad movie so i won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame,0
1144,i attempted to watch this and was highly disappointed don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amy's brother david amidst this dreck it is the polar opposite but if you're into poop fart and boner jokes you'll be in seventh heaven this is bathroom humor aimed i assume at those who've had several which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as the best television writing ever i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high end comedy the characters overact the shock factor is set to 10 and the laughs are set to zero unless of course you seek juvenile low brow humor br br i made it through 40 minutes praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment but alas it just got worse and worse and beware of amy's ever present and hammy overbite expression it will set your eyes rolling it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris family br br to those who loved it i'm sorry this is my opinion it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review,0
1145,this was the worst wrestlemania in history the only good matches were ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez and the tag title match between the british and the dream team this one bordered on classic everything else was either poor or awful the idea of having three host cities was unnecessary confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show the celebrity guests were terrible on commentary especially susan saint james br br if you're interested in the mid 80's wwf you're better renting or buying wrestlemania 3 or just about any other ppv for that matter,0
1146,i seriously enjoy dr who br br seriously don't just dismiss me as a sci fi person because i'm not normally i caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it it is actually really funny and more often than not it's fast paced all of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle br br christopher is pretty good but david tennant is brilliant i think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a tv character again br br i don't know what it is about it but everything manages to work like clockwork br br all i'm going to say is just try it one episode probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two parter though,1
1147,i was looking forward to this movie trustworthy actors interesting plot great atmosphere then if you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life first know it ok i did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but i thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire which they almost did things i didn't get a woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone oblivious to the consequences great riddles that fell by the wayside the promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so called criminal i had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense i understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found adrian pauls role crucial and penetrating and then basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so what run out of ideas such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly it may not comprehend the meaning and i really did not expect the writers to understand it but i was hoping for an intellectual if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road,0
1148,michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy alec baldwin who was an up and coming star when the film was made is a hoot dean stockwell in a sendup of john is hysterical but mercedes ruehl as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the movie br br jonathan demme previously known for wacky comedies like something wild and melvin and howard proves once again that he is a genius i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing silence of the lambs the performances he evokes from his actors in married are inspired and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly ride br br one of the cutest most endearing films of the 80's it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era,1
1149,i was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more you don't scare it is full of american teen slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily br br but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish high school pressure of student selection exam oss that 3 hour exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration the movie is bad don't waste your time to watch it,0

1151,i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence we snuck into our local grindhouse and saw it anyway pretty good picture lots of blood from the street fights although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it and lots of sex i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him without saying a word he picks her up puts her in the and nails her from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on so when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs i ordered it online i was very disappointed black fist is bogard edited for television so many of the scenes i remember were missing i wondered if indeed this was the same picture,0
1152,the foreigner is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover operative who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map fire fights hand to hand combat pyrotechnics stunts etc and more of a story which is convoluted uninteresting and full of meaningless filler what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal looking more and more like a pork chop meanders through this insipid flick expressionless and bored while manifesting no improvement in acting ability somewhere around the glimmer man or fire down below seagal flicks took a nose dive and the foreigner is just an continuation of that trend nothing here worth watching except for the most die hard seagal fans c,0

1158,yes dumb is the word for this actress i know many have mentioned her beauty but this viewer found her empty headed and boring to watch with her bleached hair lip gloss and not so perfect body watch her walk away in those jeans showing a rather large butt her butt spreads beyond her shoulders what does that tell you as for the leading man played by gorgeous mark humphrey he was perfectly cast a charmer however he and lancaster just didn't match she was out of place opposite this good looking guy good acting by susan glover as the sister angela had a small role and was okay but the film's director philippe gagnon wasted too much footage on lancaster after a while you got tired of looking at her and watching her dull acting ability and what a bitch of a wife she was snooping on her husband being obnoxious to him and just a plain spoiled brat was happy to see her hit with the dart gun i thought it might be the end of her but alas the script tells us otherwise after torturing myself and watching this loser again i still came up with the same criticism lancaster is boring to watch this time around her hair folks her hair constantly in her face constantly tossing it back became annoying i question the writer alexandra reason why a good looking wealthy man like philippe would even bother with the likes of a bimbo like allison when there were so many attractive intelligent women with class to choose he picks this nothing is this the rochester jane eyre thing oh well it's all a matter of taste i guess this sarah lancaster is not my cup of tea folks,0
1159,the very first time i saw this i in horror at what was being presented as modern liberated women br br sorry but i cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of gucci prada and louis labels the troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in nyc it's definitely not these women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold digging br br this is not liberated womanhood and i'm glad it's gone 0 stars and just plain awful,0
1160,when i was young i was a big fan of chuck norris i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes i remember that i really liked this one in particular and thought it was one of his best now that i'm a little older i can say that although it's thoroughly average i still consider it one of his better films in an acting stretch for him norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie serial killers are all the rage nowadays and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention in contrast it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from most obviously action movies as well as stalk n' slashers of 70s and 80s while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham fisted and laughable nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck being a big fan of steve james also i can recommend this film ditto for genre legend billy drago as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role not great but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s,0

1162,jeremy irons and forrest whitaker are good actors but this movie was badly written first of all during the hijack scene irons sits too comfortably in his chair he appears to be reading something and rather calmly too perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes also the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown slow mo bullets flying how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost his grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes then he decided to get revenge and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors he's a journalist for the stuffy economist rag and lo and behold they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys how do they know but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out but not the baddies who killed his wife and blows them away anyway so he's just a murderer he gets away and well i shut it off i mean i couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers instead he's going after their friends i guess or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame it's ok son crying helps he says to his son son says no it doesn't and father says you're right it doesn't irons takes on questionable roles like that one dragon movie he did he was excellent in brideshead revisited which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller,0
1163,i loved this film fantastically original and different a solid intense hard core and suspenseful movie that has just the right touch of dark humor if you're tired of the typical overdone ridiculous hollywood b s movies how many big explosions and awful and unrealistic shoot em up gun fights that insult your intelligence can we take then this film is for you fantastic characters that are wonderfully original and believable and solid performances by all actors not a weak character or performance in the film skip woods' film is a breath of fresh air and i applaud his originality and efforts his film has the feel of a cross between a quentin tarantino and a cohen brothers film not a bad mix at all in my opinion this movie grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go there's nothing boring or bubble gum about this film the only disappointment is that nobody seems to know about it everyone i've recommended it to has thanked me and shared my opinion on it this film is a welcomed change alternative from the canned hollywood mainstream garbage being produced today even with their big name actors big explosions special effects and huge budgets it's a terrifically wild intense violent graphic humorous and raw i mean that in a good way no phony hollywood polish here ride thank you to everyone involved in making this film happen you did an incredible job,1
1164,when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year 1974 if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today br br the topic of the film deals with the old question what is real and what is illusion if you see the matrix you will find a lot of similarities but the two films are not comparable at all because welt am is art and the matrix is entertainment if prefer the first one br br unfortunately i lost my video copy of it br br,1
1165,i went to watch this film with my family who were expecting a neatly conclusive story like mrs and they returned home thoroughly disappointed so this is a warning to all story to stay away 15 park avenue does not seek to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally challenged rather its intention is loud and clear it questions every human being's sane or not sense of reality in fact for me it even arouses doubts about my taken for granted sense of sanity the security bondage satisfaction that i find in my present is it really what i am or does it really create an illusion that all of us desperately and sometimes ignorantly cling on to just to falsely console the neglected which exists in all of us in some way or the other so why does anjali so maniacally makes it a point to show off her strength of mind when she is really harrowed by the realization that she is becoming a monster aren't we all who think we are really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable about it deep down inside is it not better to be happy even insanely than to create the impression of while suppressing one's fragility bravely madly sincerely does that and society labels her as the ending did confound me at first but then you realise that bravery and sincere belief took her where she wanted to go she found what she was searching for not caring what society had to comment upon her search and it is the seemingly 'real' people anjali the psychiatrist and jojo who never reach anywhere my family thinks that i am schizophrenic too in trying to make sense of a film that is largely to the rest of the world anyone else willing to believe in my sense of reality,1
1166,spanish director luis buñuel career spanned almost 50 years from 1929 to 1977 arguably his best films were those he made during his exile in mexico from the late forties to the early 60s there he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences yet he somehow managed to make interesting thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time this movie is based on a novel by spanish author benito perez and the adaptation is quite faithful even if the setting is now early 20th century mexico instead of early 20th century spain the protagonist is a priest who tries to live a life that is as faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by christ the question many would ask is whether such endeavor would be possible without incurring in the hostility and mockery of your fellow human beings as it happens he suffers a lot of indignities yet he remains stubborn until the controversial final shot to this objective i think buñuel wanted to show as a somewhat ridiculous figure but perhaps inadvertently his stubbornness at least to this viewer comes out as admirable in any case a great film,1
1167,every movie quentin tarantino has made has become progressively worse i'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement but seeing as sic basterds sic has an 8 5 10 from over 100 000 ratings it doesn't seem like the general movie going public has any sense even his best work reservoir dogs wasn't a 'masterpiece ' the trouble is that claiming that you like tarantino's work has become trendy as soon as that happens you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon they will ignore laughably terrible acting and utterly self indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called everyone this movie is so terrible that i swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him like another reviewer has already said previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing i couldn't agree more this movie is nothing more than self indulgent and in joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play but thanks to the general movie going public i'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made bravo tarantino you've pulled off one of the best practical jokes of all time,0
1168,i bought this movie because of raquel welch she was gorgeous in this film as she played the role of harry mike wagner girl friend harry a robber down on his luck trying to make one more heist harry goes to a funeral where he meets vittorio de sica and takes him for a ride when things don't work out on the ride they put there mines together to figure out the fastest way to get money harry and his gang decide with the help of vittorio de sica to from there on mob rest a sure that no matter what the gang goes after that the outcome is never the same and will keep you on the edge of your sit the rest of the out come you need to watch for yourself as far as raquel goes if you're a fan of here then you need to watch this movie because she never looked better standing on the beach with a on i give this movie 10 weasel stars on raquel welch body alone it's no wonder why she was the hottest actress back in the sixties she was the sex symbol everyone one wanted and no one could get not only does she look good she can act even better if you like raquel welch then you'll like this movie,1

1170,this movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in istanbul as time passes their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work that's most of the movie in fact the problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are very withdrawn and non communicative they don't make for a very satisfying movie that's because most of the time he and his just stare into space and say nothing i think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie i certainly wouldn't have minded,0
1171,if you described any of the scenes nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep your infant daughter talking to ghosts searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night so petrified with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above  then i'd say you had a horror movie but some how 'wicked little things' just wasn't scary i am a horror fan and i loved the location the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies i didn't want to see them come to harm i wanted the 'bad guy' to get his just desserts the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every cliché in the book even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you br br i would still recommend that you watch it but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years you will have seen it all before,0
1172,did i waste my time this is very pretentious film in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people br br unbelievably boring pointless film stay away so many good soundtracks i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film stay away 1 on 10,0
1173,unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question br br this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force is perfect for the squad br br what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live in relationship with a reporter chelsea field that one certainly threw me in this film you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team br br and what his team is is a death squad they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act then it's open season br br extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside no civilians got hurt when the citizens of did that to the or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in that's what were asked to believe here br br and frankly i couldn't buy it a lot of good players get really wasted in this one,0
1174,i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to my first thoughts were that i have never been more ashamed to be an indian as well as a hindu i found this movie to be down right appalling please don't waste your time as for the music there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap the beautiful scenes are not what india is known for i just hope that i have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag if your up for a good indian movie watch something by director mira nair,0
1175,this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror disgusting the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north indian plains the message the educated english speaking indian tried to save the poor beggars of india in all earnestness it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own br br as a love story its okay the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics,0
1176,lance henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a b movie even in this case starring along side charles napier master control program and joe don baker as always he does a great job of being the bad guy but the plot is just bad don't even get me started about the ending and the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty is it just me or does it seem that joe don baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute also anytime glass is broken in this movie the editing is so anti phenomenal lastly after watching this i figure david warner is dying for tron 2 0 to finally get the green light br br unfortunately for this will be the third movie i give the rating of 1 10 joining iron eagle iv and no mercy,0
1177,i don't see why everyone is bombing this so much i thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasn't popular enough to be that famous believe me i have seen much much worse than this if you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something so what this is normal slasher fare but better than most and it is watchable this movie also has one of the best soundtracks i've heard some of the music is very suspenseful and the death scenes are cool too we see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words sold written in blood on the mirror and we also get a cool double beating by a toilet with razors attached to it this was a good fun 80s slasher that's definitely worth your time despite what others say about it,1

1181,a better film could have been made to portray the tragedy of bosnia some parts are very effective and the film does well to give some idea of the suffering of the people specially the children but overall it looks less like a film and more like a documentary woody harrelson is very good but the rest of the cast has performed well without being extra ordinary should be watched in order to get a rough idea of what the war did to the children of bosnia if one expects a great and gripping movie welcome will be a disappointment,0
1182,ok a film about a film that takes a crack at video movie making could be entertaining could be should be funny edgy even controversial or at least interesting and yet this film is the negative version of that hamlin was entertaining as a 'b' film producer shatner played crazy yet likable and had all the best lines the rest of the characters were boring predictable boring underdeveloped boring and boring the production value was lame you'll actually see the boom come down in one scene the sound was awful in some of the scenes hey i'm a big fan of shatner's and of hamlin now but their talents are wasted here at least the story had a clichéd ending,0
1183,a swedish splatter movie has the world gone insane br br probably not but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore flicks the b movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days long gone are the golden days of i and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own it's just too much talk in it it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx which are great for a b movie the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though but that actually don't matter that much it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void br br every person who know about gert will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt though i nearly laughed my ass off it's really that hilariously bad br br besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b movies br br 4 10,0

1186,there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great sadly like bring it on 2 bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film the performance of hayden was sub par both in terms of acting and cheerleading there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene lines plot etc were just so stupid my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the acting of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film only great character,0

1188,sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes it was like was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie,0
1189,if this film had been directed by dw griffith or stanley kubrick it would be recognized for what it is a cinematic masterpiece told with depth and subtlety and passion a film with no equal in the visual realm it is unremittingly stunning and also very brutal in its depiction of our great heritage of greed and annihilation and of course what the reviewers could not abide is it doesn't tell a simple narrative dick and jane tale like 99 of hollywood output its characters are complex and confused by their passions and thoughts fears and emotions they even appear to be thinking something your average movie reviewers do not understand and cannot abide so they destroyed it see the original uncut wide screen version it is stunning,1
1190,what a great show a very underrated dramatic show it is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character s are the main character s i think the best character on the show is vern he is a tough bad guy and an aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be this show has many murders i think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show but i have to admit that is one of the reasons why i think the show is so great i think some characters were killed off a little early but some sure still made their mark you can't compare things like prison break to this show they are totally different i think some of the actors on the show are also very good and underrated and should what is due to them a great show my favorite's a show that should be considered of the the greats for years to come,1

1193,staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his output i'm apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder mystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher the sound is terrible the dialog is otherworldly bad there's some primitive mannequin gore plus some dismemberments and guts and it's technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of it's excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if you're not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one,0
1194,wallace gromit have been around for some time but this was their first foray onto the silver screen fans of the british tv series like myself were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original in a world of cg movies like shrek and toy story this stop motion film is a nice alternative to the trend in children's movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon plus compared to much earlier stop motion films such as king kong and the ray harryhausen films such as sinbad the quality and movement of the characters are light years better looking very fluid natural and more alive br br apart from the quality of the animation this movie also deserves kudos on every other level first the voice actors do a great job second the script is very simple but also very cute and enjoyable with a few double entendres that should probably go way over the kids' heads third they manage to make this not only a movie for kids but people of all ages as the film is neither saccharine nor aimed solely at the younger crowd in particular i was captivated by incredibly cute the film was and especially the adorable bunnies i especially liked them in the closing credits which made me very happy i stayed to watch the entire film br br the bottom line is that unless you are a real stick in the mud you will enjoy this film it's fresh funny and amazingly clever i hope we see a sequel and this is saying something as i usually hate sequels,1
1195,to this day there isn't a movie i've seen more times than the chipmunk adventure nor has any movie brought me more happiness this is by no means the greatest film or even the greatest animated film but to an 8 year old girl in 1988 it was the coolest funniest most exciting film ever i'm still equally as impressed today with the musical numbers each one a standout song with wonderfully dramatic lyrics in the epic tradition of 80's pop think pat on helium only catchier br br controversy has stirred over the blatantly suggestive tone of the song gettin' lucky with you which to me seemed much more innocent at the time however looking at it as a rational adult i can totally understand the concern you've got three young girls in skimpy harem outfits passionately proclaiming getting lucky is what it's all about the were definitely sexualized tenfold for this movie br br but this controversial issue doesn't even come close to overshadowing the otherwise fabulous feature length animated adventure i encourage parents and childless adults alike to check out this movie especially if you were a child of the eighties early nineties like me,1
1196,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies for example and instead of funny its just pathetic whatever you do don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you turn around and run the other way,0
1197,i thought this movie was awful i understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb the plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron in fact all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all the audience relates to no one in the movie it was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don't care about the characters it's hard to get into the movie at all i felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story all the plot twists at the end were just a little too much i was actually laughing when i guess i was supposed to be shocked all in all i thought it was really just a bad movie,0
1198,i found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story i thought the acting was on the whole quite good reginald owen did chew the scenery as mentioned by others but i found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes tcm has made an ann harding fan of me and i thought she was fine as usual here jessie ralph had a field day as the old ordering everybody around and frank morgan as always played frank morgan with a twinkle br br for me the problem was the script and or the editing transitions were awkward motivations were murky the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly i felt completely let down particularly since i had such fond memories of the later version,0
1199,while researching susan harrison the ballerina in reference to a bonanza episode i was reminded of this gem br br this episode is the inspiration for dylan's all along the watch tower hendrix's cover is probably as well know and is one of his best which is one of his best br br thus this episode is responsible for several not bad for approximately 22 minutes of television br br but this is the twilight zone further comment of the series is unnecessary br br characters' is typical serling intense dramatic barreling toward an end that is as inevitable in hindsight as it is surprising the first time you see it br br this episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for any who have not seen it br br but you will feel ambushed and you will never listen to hendrix with the same ears again,1
1200,this is arguably the worst of the major ava gardner films yes she is gorgeous but that can wear thin over time especially after the corny and predictable movie ending br br in this turkey robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie bracken which surely embarrassed him olga san juan plays the jane powell golly gee part dick plays a sort of dim sidekick and eve arden plays helen broderick and a host of other wise cracking female semi comedians yes the film contains a major popular song speak low but check out the other entirely forgettable pieces dick sings very well of course and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava br br the sets are cheap the script is filled with clichés and failed humor and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor as indeed he was in short if you want to see ava in her prime buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie,0
1201,should i have expected anything other than putrid from carrot top this was on of the worst movies i have ever seen it is by far the worst comedy i have ever seen chairman of the board did not add humor to my attitude rather it enraged me that's right carrot top is such a bad comedian that i became enraged that this man is making movies,0
1202,humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i wasn´t expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it doesn´t mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that,0
1203,frank sinatra took this role chewed it up with the rest of the scenery and spat it out his way is stagey the ending is trite some of the scenes need a little more cutting but that's all it's great entertainment from start to finish and while you watch it you realise that sinatra that long dead mor crooner had junkies gangster card games and the whole us urban hustle thing in his blood he didn't learn it from an acting coach there are all sorts of directorial touches to keep you amused and the non dated soundtrack cooks all the way the marathon card game beat goodfellas sopranos etc by forty years so it wasn't faithful to the book what movie is and i can't imagine it being remembered if brando had been let loose on it the cold turkey scenes would have been embarrassing instead of edgy convincing and moving with sinatra no one else has mentioned the seedy lazy cynical cops absolutely spot on and eleanor parker would have driven me to smack,1
1204,fc de only reason for existence is it's local popularity it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years and still counting br br it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis amateur every storyline deals with the same subject some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous and predictable proportions to get resolved in the end br br the show's been running for over 15 years now and the production probably decided not to change a winning team which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years besides a couple of actors getting replaced they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show the humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place br br i guess you have to be flemish to get this and over 60 years old to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this,0
1205,i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible i've been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try le dernier combat there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them absolute dribble,0
1206,this wonderful film is a love story and shows that not all relationships are destined to last even so they can be great worth the pain suffering of breakup br br director gives us an insight of the period around 1900 the way society mis treats women and how a very strong woman deals with with great costumes landscapes lovely music and good actors and acting this draws you in for the length of the movie br br at first the ending is a bit sudden a page describing the rest of her life scrolls on reflection this is a great the best way to have your own fantasy create the rest of her life br br this was the second movie for me that had people sit while the end titles by the first being schindler's list apparently the movie had this effect on everybody,1
1207,well this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be i was expecting to give it one star i chose to give it three why well for a cheesy horror sci fi movie it's not all that bad sure the characters are tacky as is their acting including a young leonardo dicaprio the effects cheap looking and the monsters well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas this movie will let you live your dream 3 10,0
1208,i was recently at a sleepover birthday party with five other girls all my age eleven all of us thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as jaws decided to rent it along with rat race we watched rat race after when a stranger calls as to ease our fear we put the movie on at 11 00 at night and lay together in our sleeping bags hiding behind covers for most of it i screamed five times which is unusual for me as i get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream br br all of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the stalker jenkins as we called him for some reason would get us i played a mean trick one everyone was all dozing off once rat race was over i hid under my sleeping bag and said quietly and lowly have you checked the childen they all screamed like nuts and were so scared all in all i would rate this movie a 9 the only thing i didn't like was that 1 there were too many false alarms when jill thinks the stalker is there and 2 the kids never woke up during the whole thing until jenkins kidnapped them and hid them in the cupboard at which time all they did was cry like babies i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller but one thing i am so not babysitting past 9 00 pm ever,1
1209,this is a good plot concept so why o why is it such a poor film the acting is terrible and every shock is signposted so far in advance that it is almost laughable by the time it reaches you spend your time and money elsewhere this is not worth watching,0
1210,this was a sad waste of two such promising actors chris klein's character was unlikable from the start and never made an improvement what did she see in him he was rarely kind never thankful for what he does have and a coward pass this one by on the shelves you'll be glad you did,0
1211,if you're a kid liking fairy tale real life adventures see it if you're a youth liking kids movies why not see it if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids you're way better of opting for the squirrel br br the start of this film was a bit funny and set some good premises for the happenings to take place but after the kind of funny introduction of characters settings and potential conflicts the story turned out kinda dull when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time the word predictable repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a lp or those commercials you really hate and the culmination of the plot oh sigh poor poor poor,0
1212,spoilers throughout br br not good the movie differed completely from the book not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good br br i guess demi moore was ok actually i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other however the big disappointment wasn't with ms moore br br why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart i'm referring to him as the millionaire because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version just another change br br people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall he is also fascinating the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot it was almost like seeing a completely different movie br br i know many movies vary widely from the books but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp this isn't redford's fault he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men that wasn't really the point of the book br br this could have been a lot better even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much but changing so much around definitely takes it for me a few points down,0
1213,there is an endless supply of trashy horror movies it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill alas very seldom these attempts succeed this unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value the story is highly predictable most of the actors very uninspired or just plainly miscast special effects of very low quality it took a lot of effort not to switch off the dvd and go to bed with such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the usa why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel to top it all apparently there is an anatomy 2 for those who have nothing better to do i'd rather watch the paint dry,0
1214,if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible wait till you see this br br okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring compounded by other circumstances in this case the even is the joining of two huge storm systems fair enough so far oh but hold up no the event is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid br br next throw in loads of human interest elements in this case a cheating husband a psychotic gun wielding boyfriend a rebellious daughter a hacker with a point to prove a senator trying to push an agenda a reporter trying to stand up against the man and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator br br finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement br br jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines there would have been no time less for the actual disaster which given the pitiful state of the computer graphics was almost certainly the intention br br jeez if you can't even model a truck convincingly you really should not be taking on twisters exploding power stations las vegas getting ripped apart or destroyed oil stations br br in case you didn't already gather how appalling this movie is let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate and wholly ungratifying implausible manners that stunk more of moralising that good film making br br i'm have no problem with first month film students writing jaded hackneyed cliché soaked scripts but for god's sake that doesn't mean anyone has to make them into movies br br it manages to make the abysmally implausible 10 0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful avoid them both,0
1215,let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details arnold to antichrist let's see who is meanest said with a straight face and you can tell they were not trying to be funny br br how do you think arnold will battle the evil of all evils br br blessed water a crucifix a priest nooo with a bazooka yes not even satan expected it they're so clever br br after an engaging beginning which reminds you of devil's advocate it goes nowhere somebody get me those two hours of my life back don't ever watch it rent it lest buy it br br,0
1216,ocean's twelve just plain stupid bad and nothing compared to the other two br br an art robbery 10 known actors at least a weak script and very slow developing idea that's why i characterize a movie i only saw at least 20 minutes of it don't get me wrong you may like it but i only like the ocean's films because of the heist theme if ocean's 12 it's not about heist then what's the point to see it glad soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one kudos for that br br steven soderberg isn't really a good director apart from his hit sex lies and videotapes nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director shame on him but his fault only,0
1217,spoiler or two not that is matters br br two things stand out about this movie first is it's been titled both bruno and the dress code and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that br br second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion which probably opens up an even can of worms what was she thinking br br yes there's some humor and it's not directly offensive but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that different people should be accepted or maybe excepted no matter what br br which is fine but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll yet all the other kids dress and behave well like regular kids so what gives if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like and the result would be total chaos br br this accepting of people who are different is also pretty narrowly defined i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls hunt geese and go to tractor pulls and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is bruno is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time,0
1218,after seeing big fat liar i think jason learned a lot more when he told the truth about marty stealing his story it was like the boy who cried wolf people heard him but they didn't believe him nobody did anything to help him besides not only marty's movies stink so does his advice the truth is not overrated i am so glad he got exposed for what he really is everyone found out that he stole from that boy including his parents not only he stole from that boy and lied about it he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own which is plagiarism doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea another reason why he got fired he is not trustworthy he's a liar a cheat a thief a crook and a plagiarist you got that marty you're a plagiarist plus you got everything that you deserved,1
1219,although it doesn't seem very promising for a long stretch renoir's french cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film the story is cliché a laundry girl françoise is discovered by a night club owner jean gabin steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend both of whom come back for their former lovers has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker go on with the show with her employer oh or become a princess as a prince falls in love with her at one point too i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have the film ends with the opening of new night club the moulin rouge and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers the first of them de la butte which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written and renoir himself wrote it if you're a fan of baz luhrmann's 2001 film moulin rouge you'll recognize the tune as it comes up near the beginning of that film sung by rufus wainwright although it isn't very prominent in that film everyone i know who owns the soundtrack loves it in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen it's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 8 10,1
1220,i gave this movie a four star rating for a few reasons first i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that still it's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place br br my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like something i am very interested in indeed this movie almost hit the target it was more like on the edge of the target more on the tree than the target itself br br the basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments however because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms the men of the couples are now able to feel smell hear and see the demons of the spiritual world in that order apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm br br this movie is very clichéd they took the title seriously as the men while chained to the beds demand their women look behind them because there is something there br br although a good effort for what it was i think the special effects could have been done so much better the demon scratching at the woman was in a word hilarious the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died we were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair though br br the message is one that i don't care to comment on other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it br br and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault i am not a christian and don't like this type of message and i got a kick out of making comments throughout my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k,0
1221,its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines but ill give it a try just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did to watch this awful and boring movie br br i like patrick swayze he did a excellent performance in films like ghost dirty dancing point break north south tv series but in this movie argh this movie is so the acting is awful the script sucks well i cant even find one good thing nothing absolutely nothing i was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours which we didn't know when part 1 was over and it said to be continued we almost cried do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie br br its painful to see this movie at no time do you get the impression that the actors are russians the action scenes are extremely bad the only good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie the rest is crap go clean your toilet instead of watching this movie and don't come running crying if you do see this movie you were pre warned personally i would recommend patrick swayze to call his agent and have them recall this movie its that bad,0
1222,this is a really great film in the pulp fiction genre with a touch of film noir thrown in truly one of emma thompson's best performances to date this film has everything it's well written well directed beautifully films and has some great performances i don't know why it didn't catch on it's spectacular,1
1223,the child's play series isn't a favourite of mine but bride of chucky is actually an okay movie this time we have two dolls chucky and his former girlfriend when he was human tiffany together they go on a journey to find an object there are a few interesting scenes through the movie like the guy getting hit by the truck and literally exploding the sex scene between chucky and tiffany and the ending which allows for another sequel to take place wasn't really a straight forward horror it mixed a lot of comedy and was a sort of spoof of the horror genre this made the movie better like comedy does do with many horror movies all up even if your not a child's play fan give this one a go,1
1224,wow this movie is bad think flashdance with ninjas the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in midair but you can see the strings or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye patch that looks like a coaster that the good ninja wears actually there are so many bad parts i can't make up my mind which is the worst i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at,0
1225,is an awful movie the script the story the acting are all simply laughable dino plays a man who pays emraan hashmi to seduce his wife yes this is as ridiculous as it sounds both and hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting plays the aggressive capricious and angry wife she is good looking but has zero acting talent the film has one hit song called which is composed and sung by himesh reshammiya i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing avoid this cheapo at any cost,0
1226,i only voted excellent because this film took two snapshots of americana one in 1970 and one for every year afterward br br nothing's really changed br br joe is actually a jerk a big stupid slob who's mad at everybody else in the world for his own idiocy this ain't really a spoiler but the key to the film is the big corporate never does wrong guy making friends with this semi joe and he gets some kind of validation from his bigotry and stupidity and sense of being wronged br br yet few would argue that the dealer boyfriend did deserve to die and those kids shouldn't have ripped joe and compton off and joe and compton were actually getting into the hash and the young skin until they got ripped off a simple film in many ways except that in 1970 new york city was par to a battle zone thanks to nixon's care and all of the money going to the war in vietnam as i write this 2 25 2007 there is a very long wait on netflix for this film which makes me happy because i think there are people out there who want to learn this was a pretty good snapshot not exact a bit caricaturist but actually pretty close to how it was back then and the scary thing is things haven't changed that much sure there's no more welfare but that just means the wage slavery has won out br br amazing how millionaires will complain about not making enough money then complain that 5 15 an hour is too much to pay their people,1
1227,this movie is awful beyond belief it's a low budget badly written piece of pointless garbage but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television the badness of this movie is epic maybe not ed wood epic but close the premise is hysterical men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in haw football stadiums the pseudo dyke culture is laughably bizarre there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service deviants and the last man of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show i didn't get to see the end of it which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy what have we all learned from this nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth but everything in the first two thirds was so memorably bad even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy stupid brainless sci fi b flicks,0
1228,when a loser teen is bitten by an insect he becomes the superhero dragonfly br br superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens sadly however despite the presence of david zucker who was involved with airplane top secret and the naked gun movies it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have mainly it's more dumb than fun the fault mainly lies with the gags it's simply not funny enough some of the jokes do work such as the nail gun scene but other parts simply fall flat the x men spoof for example or the whole farting sequence blazing saddles this isn't one of the key things about the best spoof movies like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny the cast for the most part play is completely straight this makes it even funnier even when there is simple dialog in the foreground there may well be funny things happening behind the cast again funny the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts to hang the gags on br br the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies then try and spoof them as a result the so called plot of these movies very rarely exist another flaw these movies have is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene the cast try to get into the spirit required but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes it's hard to get worked up about it br br as recent spoof movies go it's not as bad as epic movie date movie or the awful meet the spartans but considering that some people involved here have made good funny movies in the past it's nowhere near good enough,0
1229,a terrific b feature a virtual two hander and set over the course of a day you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play and although only 77 minutes long played out in sequences akin to something like real time robert ryan is the psychopath who keeps ida lupino trapped in her own home both are superb especially the under rated lupino whose initial independence and self control soon crumble before ryan's unhinged intruder today of course it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director harry horner much better known as an art director only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of hitchcock,1
1230,was very fortunate to see the movie hari om at the bermuda international film festival it was the opening night and was such a delightful movie it was shot beautifully around india and i want to go there now the main actor vijay was absolutely incredible he was the highlight of the movie apparently he was also in the movie monsoon wedding he was the total star of the show character cracked me up was very funny and the girl forget the name was great too they were all great there were many tremendous scenes like the one with the monkeys and basically i just loved the movie everyone walking out was raving about it and it was certainly a high point of the film festival was my favorite from the festival it really beautifully captured the liveliness of india and can't believe how beautiful india is the feeling upon walking out of the cinema was a real high it is a delightful happy film i loved it,1
1231,when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings br br this is a film of bad camera work everything happens off screen usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling did you see hear that well no we didn't see that we can't and when there weren't any close ups the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down or shaking back and forth really really quickly to either convey action or to make us physically sick br br the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again i don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things i expect unreasonable things like aliens demons or good acting they were stupid too let's go have intimate relations in a cave with all of our clothes on speaking of which the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died this bugged me a bit though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a serious invasion of one girl's privacy br br no plot no climax no good acting terrible camera work what's left oh right the ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film sixth sense does it explains a lot hide and seek did too but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an if you could call it that as it doesn't explain anything br br don't see it please,0
1232,i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind i have been a big fan of qt in the past i think we can all agree he has made some great movies but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own this movie proves that it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work it consists instead mostly of long tedious boring stretches of conversation between people that after a while you realise you just do not give a stuff about it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past the entire movie is anticlimactic there is no tension what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care honestly folks don't believe the hype this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it,0
1233,at last a film to rival 'el and 'darkness falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness this is actually the first film i've ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb and with good reason br br for one the cast is nothing special that's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l bush's harrington secondly the production values a substandard television sci fi such as 'stargate' has more convincing sets and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with that aren't very convincing this film is literally the worst part though is that this film is boring for the first 45 minutes i felt as if we were going round and round in circles it's a prehistoric shark bullsh t no really bullsh t i'm not making this up bullsh t there it is now i didn't see anything let me guess yup bullsh t after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so then we're back to the dialog run around dialog is not a bad thing but that's all this film has characters talking that too is not a bad thing except this film isn't very good at it the dialog is often contrived and clichéd and is not very interesting to listen to i don't see any point slandering the special effects this film has worse qualities br br the sets are small and unrealistic the acting is sub par the script oh lord the script is worse than a garbage of sci fi television has to dredge up it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was br br yet another awful awful addition to the there's about four series of films bring on steve please,0
1234,it came before the ten commandments land of the pharaohs ben hur and it's overlooked today how unfair based on mammoth novel it doesn't cheapen it novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice i hope it will be done some day whose message is essentially christian remains intact another of his books the secret of the kingdom first part takes place after christ's death in the holy land br br the egyptian is the rising of a monotheism close to long before christ the pharaoh wilding is some kind of messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world he asks to return good for evil and he has disciples who will eventually turn into martyrs the scene when simmons and the other worshippers of the sun god are slain is visually stunning looking like some pagan ballet for the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace and that's why they look for a strong man mature who can lead the army against the as well as against their dangerous compatriots another religion or non religion should we say is purdom who during two hours believes in nothing the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum br br there's another fascinating side the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama not only for the screenplay notably sister's tierney final revelation which predates the ten commandments by two years but also the splendor of the cinematography in his book about curtiz talks about a atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath supreme narcissism around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill besides as such is often the case in modern melodramas the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing an old man who's remembering br br this is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in america but also in europa notably in poland where jerzy directed a spellbinding 1966 which owed a lot to curtiz,1
1235,it's been awhile since i've seen cold mountain bit i do knew that i enjoyed it immensely though it does take place during the the last days of american civil war it's not really a war movie it's more of a romance drama and it works mainly because of the performances usually i don't like nicole kidman but i liked here i thought she was very convincing in her role i liked rene as well who i'm not usually a fan of jude law is good as usual the supporting cast there are some great supporting performances her too numerous too mention there's also some breathtaking scenery in the film and there are also a number of very nice musical pieces as well the story is sad and tinged with tragedy but it s a beautifully done well told story for me cold mountain is an 8 10,1
1236,this movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i waste my time on this i watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me i wonder how darshan could make such a movie it doesn't have any it feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs looks fake and i wonder what role does celina has in the movie bobby deol is good at least he can act patel needs to take some acting lessons rather than taking off his shirts in almost all the scenes the end was the most pathetic br br i watched boom boom after watching 300 the movie you guys can really imagine what i felt about this bollywood movie br br i really respect bollywood but please directors and producers get real not everything is fantasy,0
1237,i really loved the millenium series starred by lance henriksen which is why i bought the film obviously at some level it was a mistake mutant monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception br br the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail well nevertheless this film would never have been a success even with a good director actors but the way it turns out this is just a b class movie the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all br br however watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious,0
1238,gordon scott made some good tarzan movies but this is not one of them br br as i watched it wincing at the bad obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast i kept thinking sheesh this is tv show level then i find out it was indeed three tv show pilot episodes woven seam fully into one br br it's nice to see scott get outside alone away from the lame sets in a few of the scenes and the fights do have some pretty nice moves but oh ow and ouch as to the dialog and did i mention the acting heck cheetah or in this version was a better actor than most of the humans br br and that's not saying much br br it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman i e scatman acting as a native but probably not worth the overall time investment,0
1239,as i sat watching this episode i kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end and then nothing the whole family is huddled around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then fade to black br br perhaps one of the poorest season finales i've ever seen nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season the only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by agent harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey wow really i would never expect something like that from mobsters i'm on the edge of my seat br br it almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show i've ever seen they tease and hint but rarely deliver any more br br what's with the arabs that hang out at the bing they keep throwing them in front of us and magically nothing happens br br paulie knee caps some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and poof gone in the wind br br and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure please have him get arrested or overdose or something interesting br br this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now bout it,0
1240,this is truly awful the attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film every possible thing about this movie that could be bad is music acting lighting sets special effects about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing make up is almost passable face only that's it zip don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy it's really not worth your time even the aborted captain america movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess,0
1241,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is not a shred of historical accuracy in fact reality is reversed just one example morgan preyed on the few ethnic chinese he encountered the acting is over the top the script is a poorly written lie i have never seen worse fake beards br br hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero since the script was ten made up on the fly the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is br br any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film,0
1242,i recently picked up all three robocop films in one box set rather cheaply and the only reason i did this was for the special edition of the superb first one i have seen robocop 2 before but not for 17 years the year it came out i have never watched it since because i can still remember how disappointed i was when i discovered how appalling it really is its a complete mess really it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub plots going on at the same time it has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films i have ever seen i don't mind a little violence the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty also the sfx is terrible even for 1990 say hello to bad stop motion also having a drug dealing cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much peter weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one the only positive thing i can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store to quote the kid who plays the villain it sucks,0
1243,after a very scary crude opening which gives you that creepy chainsaw massacre feeling everything falls apart br br spoiler alert as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing you know they are the real killers anyone who have seen enough of these fooled ya movies can figure this out br br this movie is with one thing in mind to depict brutal murders why then is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well will this be next for us movie goers the torture and abuse of children whats wrong with you people lynch is truly has a disgusting ugly mind,0
1244,this film ain't half bad it may be a little long at times but carried along by beautiful scenery an immensely beautiful love letter and great actors you forget time and enjoy the grand prize however goes to blythe danner and geraldine mcewan as well that would be telling but they are just great,1
1245,in defense of this movie i must repeat what i had stated previously the movie is called it has a no name cast and i do not mean no name as in actors who play in little seen art house films i mean no name as in your local high school decided to make a film no name and it might have a 2 dollar budget so what does one expect hitchcock br br i felt the movie never took itself seriously which automatically takes it out of the worst movie list that list is only for big budget all star cast movies that takes itself way too seriously the movie the oscar comes to mind most of sylvester stallone's movies the two leads were not hepburn and tracy but they did their jobs well enough for this movie the woman kicked butt and the guy was not a blithering idiot the actor who played the old man was actually very good the man who played anal retentive professor was no clifton webb but he did a god job and the for lack of a better were played by two competent actors i laughed at the 50 cent special effects but that was part of the charm of the movie it played like a hybrid tremors meets night of the living dead the premise of the movie is just like all giant bug movies of the 50's a meteor or radiation stir up the ecosystem and before you know it we have giant ants lobsters rocks or lizards terrorizing the locals a meteor was the cause of the problems this time i was was very entertained i didn't expect much and i go a lot more then i bargained for,1
1246,brilliant ranks along with citizen kane the matrix and godfathers must see at least for basset in her early days watch it,1
1247,this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen one has to take anything by truffaut seriously it's not just some b movie cranked out by hacks br br evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick and neither could deneuve whose dozen character flip flops are simply unbelievable not even badly acted just not acted at all among other things how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's the cliché ending which i won't describe is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake,0
1248,yeah that's right if i were to ask my friends this question what's the worst movie you have ever seen they might reply something like armageddon can you drill the hole shriek plan nine from outer space the medallion scooby doo etc no don't get offended by this by thinking you have seen something that might be in the same department of naturally produced human fertilizer that this movie is in if the worst movie you can think of is let's say so bad it really pisses you off then you know nothing my friend br br crazy six i remember the day me and a buddy of mine went to the local video store to rent a movie both of us had already been through most of the movies in there and on the new movies shelf we see it staring at us wow there's some good actors here man says something about mafia lets just get it and get out of here this was without doubt the worst movie mistake in my movie loving life it was also the worst mistake for everybody else movie lover or not br br watching this movie is as fun as watching a glass of ice cold water or ice tea until it reaches room temperature watching this movie will make you dream an eternal dream of death if death is just blackout light and nothing and then you realize you are just staring at your tv monitor not staring you are actually paying as much attention that is humanly possible this is no joke br br this movie is the perfection of making a bad movie it's not the kind of bad you can watch point and laugh of its the kind of movie that is so bad you actually have no chance of ever get out of your memory unless perhaps you use electric shock therapy to clear out the brain hey that might be something similar to how i remember me and my buddy felt after watching it br br best regards from me to you albert pyun br br,0
1249,you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow wow i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists right however none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts that's the level of their martial arts skills the actors are way overacting the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty,0
1250,an awful travesty of the greek resistance senorita cruz badly miscast as a greek girl there are plenty of attractive good english greek actresses so why pick a spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an english actor as her father supposedly a greek doctor many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from greek theatre and tv series the only foreign actor to my knowledge who has successfully portrayed a greek was anthony quinn as the macedonian miner zorba in zorba the greek as the in the greek tycoon and as a greek colonel in the guns of br br there is some historical truth reflected in the film people who remember the italian occupation of the islands agree that the italians were not harsh unlike the germans who succeeded them also mussolini's forces as hinted in the movie had been defeated by the greek army in the albanian campaign after the germans intervened in the balkans they allowed the italian military to occupy certain parts of greece so the refusal of the local government to surrender to italian forces rather than to the germans as portrayed in the film is quite plausible although i am not certain this actually happened,0
1251,first of all i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrad's heart of darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie with that said i believe that this movie is astounding it is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it coppola showed real genius in the art of film making using many visuals to help tell the story the acting i felt was definitely all around up to par marlon brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting his elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all in my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best made films of all time,1
1252,this extremely low budget monster flick centers around a group of mine exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth reopening they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was the script and acting is terrible the stop motion monster effects were unintentionally funny and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly looked like a logistical nightmare all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort but maybe from either a lack of budget experience and or lack of creative inspiration the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for effort and a d for actual results not insultingly bad as some low budget monster movies i've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands i'm voting it a 4,0
1253,possible spoilers br br i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan i was looking forward to seeing them together being married and all i wanted to see their on screen chemistry okay that being said i guess the fact that they are actors their off screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances especially with this script br br how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone i don't remember the original but i can only assume that o'brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady probably in a more inevitable way if i were bonded to someone i'd be pretty angry the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming that whole section of the movie was so horrible especially meg having to go to the bathroom 2 between dumpsters in the dark at night ewww no f ing way br br what's with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie sock first ask questions later not once not twice but too many times i could have kept count if i were so inclined br br the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot the assumed off screen drama leading up to this tragedy i think it could have been written in without distracting from quest br br my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable br br i won't even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered how ludicrous is that even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained a true film noir moment everyone on screen seemed bored oh happened oh yawn dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder oh the tension you could cut it with a spoon br br if anyone but dennis had been in this movie i'd have to give it 1 2 star only because i really have seen worse but in this case 1 1 2 stars br br for dennis and meg stars see anything else,0
1254,if you can watch a bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as octopussy and still enjoy it br br if you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a tv movie br br if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious and still see james bond br br if you can get past an inexperienced basinger a weaker largo and a jolly q br br if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score not up there with barry on his worst day br br if you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release br br if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same br br yours is never say never again and everything that's in it br br and what is more you'll probably enjoy it my son,1
1255,a very comical but down to earth look into the behind the scene workings of an australian bowling club the way they deal with various problems such as takeovers and general running of the club not to mention the car parking dilemma was well scripted,1
1256,just desserts was i must say one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies my expectations weren't high to begin with but it turned out to be cornier than i expected i thought it might not be all that bad when it started but as soon as the name of the competition the golden whisk came up i began changing my mind it all went downhill from there the only thing i did like about this movie other than snickering at it's absurd plot and dialogue was watching them cook however being a movie about pastry chefs there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie you get to see more food being prepared and you dodge the pathetic one liners however if you enjoy corny love stories which is sometimes fun go ahead and watch,0
1257,i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend so when it wasn't as bad as that i was delightfully surprised br br unfortunately i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well and i was wrong br br apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad br br i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw or wonder if i saw the wrong movie br br ed quinn as ellis and emmanuelle vaugier as alexandra morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them they deserve to be in better movies br br the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable hate able and that made for a tolerable watch but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time br br oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it aloud all the way through the movie did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms only once did it happen zombies wandering in and i found that a little convenient soldiers walk into a room leave the door wide open pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it with the hapless being cornered with no way to escape and yet only once did zombies follow them in br br nitpicky maybe but honestly if i was fighting for my life the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me br br that is really the only thing bothered me throughout the movie and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original,0
1258,this is a poor poor movie full of clichés unrealistic moments punching the air in celebration after putting a fire out never mind that someone's lost their home and possessions announcing a pregnancy in a bar along with all your mates before telling you in private first walking on the roof of a burning building for no apparent reason the stereotypical funerals and strained relationships the very dodgy cheesy music at the end the unrealistic treatment of the girl who was rescued from her apartment the very unrealistic explosion from that same apartment did they have a couple of oxygen tanks in the attic or something anyone with an ounce of wit can see that this movie was a joke it's a pity because firefighters do an awesome job and they deserve to have a good movie made about what they do but not at the expense of common sense,0
1259,honore de balzac's genuinely bizarre short story on which this was loosely based gets an unsettling albeit breathtakingly filmed treatment here as a sort of forbidden love blossoms over a period of time between man and beast in the early part of the nineteenth century thin and very blonde english actor ben daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the napoleonic wars who gets lost whilst escorting an exiled french painter across the rugged dangerous landscapes of the gobi desert after literally going around in circles the two men give up ever trying to reach civilization again thus each decides against better judgment mind you to go their separate ways with the promise of both returning to the same exact spot when and if a water source is actually found this is of course how daniels' character comes to encounter the creature a wild and untamed female leopard and eventually form a seemingly unbreakable bond or rather love with it that both saves his life and nearly destroys it by film's end the exquisite cinematography minimalist dialog somewhat demented story which arguably hints at possible bestiality in about three scenes are what ultimately lead professional critics to pan the film as pretentious and overlong rubbish while it is a film that isn't exactly for all tastes mind you i find it to be a subtle though decidedly left of center mixture of fantasy with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere highlighted by the fact that for more than half of the flick actor ben daniels is forced to perform opposite a wild animal four leopards were actually used as opposed to just the one which plain common sense and a slight knowledge of theatrics dictates that it must have been a maddening and very difficult job that he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me overall i think that passion in the desert takes a while to warm up to but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time it does in fact cast it's uniquely original spell over you in spite of everything and unlike most platonic human and animal relationship stories it need not require a talking pig monkey or shaggy dog to keep your interest throughout out of,1
1260,set in hungary in november 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising br br once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to austria as would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless yul brynner whose military power as a red army major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings he was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact br br robert morley plays the quintessential stiff upper lipped englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost light hearted logical outlook on life while jason robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career deborah kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character br br the film deals with a very tempestuous time in european history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one liners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie the chemistry in the cat and mouse game between kerr and brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together br br all in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which i would definitely watch again 8 10,1
1261,i find it terribly ironic that left wing hollywood continues to hedge its bets making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it br br if you're a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist and you're hoping for an all out condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers actually question this war or any war or the idea of war they just gripe about having to do another tour br br on the other hand if you're a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor this movie will really feel like a rip off none of these soldiers loves america or even loves the service the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys it's not we were soldiers and it's not sands of iwo jima it's not even mindless action and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy br br ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie though he's devastatingly sexy in a rough trade men's room bisexual sort of way it's hard to picture him as a slow talking' texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted this is no sgt croft in the naked and the dead he's more like joel in truman capote's other voices other rooms he can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit or that he wants his woman and wants her right now he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear,0
1262,out of the 600 or so spaghetti westerns made this has got to be in the top twenty somewhere can not believe this hasn't received any reviews gemma is excellent in this van johnson is good too though his dubbed voice is a little off but that's the charm of the italian style beautiful photography and some excellently staged action all the supporting characters are well played the severity of the racist streak in the bad guys is pretty tough even by todays standards which creates an emotional depth to character in some of the situations that take place absolutely fantastic score by luis see this is in the wonderful wide screen dvd from japan a spaghetti must have,1
1263,i never saw any of john leguizamo's stand up before i watched freak and after seeing it again on hbo comedy recently it was better more enlivening and with things that at the age of 14 i couldn't understand quite before spike lee did a wonderful job directing keeping the visual angle up to par with leguizamo's theatrics and the style of personal storytelling it's substance and style merging together but we get leguizamo's rants about race and sex the bits about sex are classic but a lot of it is about family and what sticks still fresh in my mind is about his father even when things get dark in some of the stories there's something fresh or crazy or random that leguizamo pulls out to get a laugh and it works more often than not if something does fall flat for me at any rate it might be his personality tics here and there but overall it's the kind of fun material that isn't heady but is so true to itself that it stings find it if you can,1
1264,one of our all time family favorites when we need a laugh we just put this one in and laugh all way thru like it is the first time we've seen it this film has good clean family humor pauly shore is brilliant with no plans for the thanksgiving holiday crawl shore is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative coed crawl being a big city boy must adjust to the farm life if he is to fall in love with but crawl isn't the only one who is learning new things crawl teaches and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and accepting others this is fun for viewers of all ages,1
1265,this film is replete with sentimentality unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe and irrelevant material why introduce rachel for instance she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her follow me truck to run wild and crash into fence that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film another is at the end when the aircraft was it a b 26 or an a 26 both are used in the film is left with props whirling and no in place that serves the plot of course but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler as it is the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control the ending again avoiding spoilers involves much too much talk as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches here dreyfuss just babbles on and on the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities impossibilities that i won't describe what a dull and disjointed effort,0
1266,licence fees to watch this trash and pay for it with hard earned cash humourless no hint of laughter god knows how it won a bafta br br we've now been subjected to eastenders for twenty years when oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is crass pap this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut and never has done br br the eastenders i know the real ones are kind courageous hardworking and loyal and one of their greatest attributes is humour it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week including an omnibus nothing but a bunch of moaning wailing dead from the neck up wimps who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other what a great advert for britain that is do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out obviously the woolly minded section of the public does but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything,0
1267,even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968 the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again herbie goes to monte carlo and herbie goes bananas neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68 in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick applegate entering herbie in the monte carlo rally naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is still you get to see herbie take a bath foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life so something there for everyone i think 4 10,0
1268,having seen rush live i'm able to appreciate the awesomeness of this others may complain of sound problems but it's sometimes over dubbed by the overwhelming screams of 60 000 brazilians and it goes to show the band's territorial gain of attention,1
1269,this may not be the worst movie ever made but it is absolutely the most boring wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark and mostly with vincent gallo walking away from the camera or looking down because he doesn't want to show his face for actually agreeing to being in this movie i liked his early stuff but the pretentiousness of the brown bunny and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a peg in my book and val kilmer i actually want to send him a sympathy card the doors to this actually the casting was the only reason i watched this movie and val doesn't even show up until the movie is more than halfway over simply a sad movie,0
1270,this is a really really bad movie that may seem like an oversimplification a fickle childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult the truth is there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot the really atrocious acting i'm talking nasty here folks or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema nay human culture please take my word for it don't watch it ever i'm serious stop you'll thank me for it later,0
1271,i've watched the first 15 minutes and i can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel judith light's charactor an officer has her hair down past her shoulders one of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap no there was no military advising them on this movie even an ex military enlisted could have assisted here,0
1272,i've loved this movie for a long time i hadn't seen it in a while so i again checked it out and actually found it even more enjoyable now i loved the chipmunks cartoon when i was young so naturally i adored 'the chipmunk adventure ' br br i honestly can't think of a better plot to this movie it's not wildly creative but i've always wanted to travel all over the world and so i just have so much fun watching it as my longing to travel grows even more the part with elenore singing to the little penguin always makes me cry br br 'the chipmunk adventure' will remain a favorite of mine forever i'm sure i guess it's because i saw it when i was so young i don't think it would make quite an impact on someone older seeing it for the first time unless of course they have a young heart,1
1273,i've been watching attack of the show religiously for about 6 months maybe longer but not much i was very infatuated with olivia and i found kevin to be very witty and the repertoire between them very good lately though it's starting to wear thin due to many factors for me first my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called around the net that shows 5 video clips that you would find on a site like youtube that are generally funny or of people getting hurt inadvertently some intentionally umm this when watched 4 to 5 times a week shows again and again the same stuff i really haven't seen anything that good and i can only laugh at people actually probably breaking their necks and being paralyzed so many times the show is like a late show wanna be colbert report wanna be with it's politics also if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal this humor gets old also mccain is old yeah yeah whatever libs have no guts to make fun of themselves because they are not smart enough to realize that would endear themselves as having a sense of humor that they can laugh at themselves so it's almost every show bash mccain or palin sheesh so we get the same old of people getting hurt that we are supposed to keep laughing at and then some leftist political humor that never at itself out of it's own weakness i'll keep watching since i watch at work and it's all that's on hoping that i'll be entertained but it is getting somewhat old i did like the fill in host's of chris and alison though they were actually a good change of pace maybe this show could do a rotating host thing olivia who i thought at times in the beginning was really funny has resorted to this constant pouting response and it's getting old lol 7 of 10 it will keep you in a young mindset which is good if you're a younger baby boomer like me mid 40's maybe a cartoon of the day would be another segment they should do there is a ton of stuff available they could use,1
1274,wait till you watch this one i mean even after reading this review no other movie till date has sucked more than this one one thing i wont understand is that when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for cellular to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie they might have gotten some profits that way i guess if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from tanushree datta and the girl who played the sidekick to i don't know if my problem is that i have seen cellular much earlier than this movie but that cant be a reason to support this movie i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie br br please stay away from this flick,0
1275,a gem of a cartoon from the silent era it was re discovered by cartoon network and was broadcast for likely the first time in decades if ever br br what makes this so enjoyable are the varied cameos douglas fairbanks is attacked by giant mosquitos will hays pays a visit as 'boss' of static studios as well as appearances by chaplin keaton and william s hart the image of chewing gum the shoes of the populace a money making idea for felix's near bankrupt shoe salesman boss cannot be described it must be viewed a terrific cultural gem,1
1276,ok fans it's out on dvd but the only reason to watch this is 1 to say you did due to its notoriety or 2 if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom it's a shame because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson sure it's gross but it's bad and not in a good way if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and filthy this movie is you are still interested do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead films by john waters david lynch peter jackson's braindead henenlotter's basket case etc all come to mind there's lots better out there,0
1277,i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it i didn't feel the characters at all is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates the main character doesn't act like a fundamentalist at all and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine one of the members a blonde all american white boy would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life another member a french ex skinhead doesn't quite fit in an islamic terror movement on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives which i find very strange this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show it is about just as realistic as prison break,0
1278,while it would be easy and accurate to go into why is at its heart indicative of many 'family oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms the real truth is that the show is repetitive full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows and the lead star is completely out of her element while i'm sure ms mcintire can sing and has a fan base that supports that being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next lucille ball is far far removed from reality br br reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put upon woman of which her entire family is centered yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character i could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be mia reba mcintire has no screen presence and to make a show around her seems very short sighted and indicative of most 'family oriented' programming to push a sitcom full of men stupid women do everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable br br the show is a waste of time the only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard pax ripoff just,0
1279,i have 2 complete sets from time life this is my favorite movies of all time love all the actors and actresses awsome picture love patrick this is the film that showed his true talent but yet he does not get credit for the display he preformed much credit has been missed in these films love the way they portrayed the dry and dusty of the civil war making it into one of the greatest love stories of all time and showing through all of life what true freindship means how 2 divided countries split but yet all and all the freindship remained solid even though the war divided and up but through it all till the very end they remained and taught us the viewer how true ships can still remain till present day simply the best gone with the wind doesn't compare to this film patrick at his best after seeing this movie for the one hundred thousand time i became a big fan of and have followed his career ever since have all his movies after he made north and south,1
1280,before i begin let me get something off my chest i'm a huge fan of john first film project the film a b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of a cinematic genius but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit spawned two sequels a spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph meeker a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  michael silvano a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his son's coach but once executed meeker returns as a or as kelly calls a hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making life a misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film it is a supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator a french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache a drag queen a clown a stand up comedian a shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesn't stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meeker's wife br br director john does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film's main flaw since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse,0
1281,no serious spoilers but some very minor ones br br a korean contribution to the ever popular asian horror wave concerns a husband and wife who decide that they're getting on a bit and decide to adopt a child the child who has an usual obsession with the dead tree in the family's garden eventually disappears when the couple eventually have a child of their own and the aforementioned tree seems to hold a grudge against the family itself br br and that's about it the film moves at a snails pace clocking in at over 100 minutes with 80 minute material it is essentially a thin family drama with a creepy tree and there is very little in the way of scares just shots of the tree with weird mumbling noises playing over the top however the idea of the tree being the child's mother is a pretty original one but it isn't exactly exploited to its full potential this sort of separates from much of the new wave it belongs to films like ju on and ring tend to do the opposite and milk bland ideas until they are red in the face br br the film does begin to get going towards the end however the realisation of the child's fate and the parent's actions not only the earlier curiosity of the story but are revealed with such machine gun editing that it's difficult to take in all at once the final sequence is undoubtedly creepy however it feels like too little too late br br overall the film does not feel too much like a ring cash in however with the film renaissance that korea is currently going through i couldn't help but feel this film could have been so much more,0
1282,this film is so wonderful it captures the gaming life i laughed so hard while watching this the movie is about a gaming group that have a hard time with a campaign that their dungeon master came up with the movie switches from the real world and the gaming world as they play the campaign it shows them in the gaming world as their character and then switches back to the real world when they are not playing the campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master lodge is writing the problem is lodge can't finish his module because the characters can't finish the campaign they are more for killing and looting instead of role playing lodge wants them to role play through the campaign something they have never done before they decide to bring in some extra help so they bring a wait for it girl in to play lodge also makes a a non player character a who can not witness or do wrong to play the film is how they do all this and more i don't want to spoil any of the film so i won't say any more this movie may not be a big budget film the acting may not be oscar worthy but if you are into gaming or into dungeons and dragons then definitely watch it they had a lot of fun making this film and it shows i am not going to bash on it for any movie problems such as continuity or any thing it was a low budget film that is just fun there is some slap stick comedy which i enjoy and some damn good writing in my opinion so if you want a fun film try it,1
1283,this is film is probably one of the best i've seen so far i would put it only second to all about lily chou chou because it kind of gives me the same vibes '9 souls' is about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to go and find some counterfeit money stored in a time capsule at mount fuji primary school they later find out that there wasn't much there and set off on their own ways the first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and for the main points to be stated it is a comedic yet serious part of the journey the second half moved me to tears as the movie progresses each character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams but unfortunately ending somewhat badly in the end only 2 of the 9 escapees are left the way that each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel tears in your eyes a beautiful film directed fantastically this is a movie for people who have enjoyed other films such as 'blue,1
1284,no one expects the star trek movies to be high art but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes unfortunately this movie had a muddled implausible plot that just left me cringing this is by far the worst of the nine so far movies even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie including the goofy scenes with kirk spock and mccoy at yosemite br br i would say this movie is not worth a rental and hardly worth watching however for the true fan who needs to see all the movies renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it even the cable channels avoid this movie,0
1285,in the changing world of cg and what not of cartoon animations etc etc was a warm welcome at least by me i think it's important to show these sort of films once in a while to preserve them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from people were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days call me old fashioned but i liked it it's a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination,1
1286,this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating if you're trying to impress some cute little i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot br br also i was wondering where does a teal ninja hide are ninjas color coded like this is this normal if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword br br and i finished my black star ninja test the other day it was multiple choice it went pretty good i found there were a lot of questions on how to sneak around and look evil its all about the eyebrows and the attitude br br basically the movie could have been better if 1 there was no color coded ninjas or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja 2 joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him 3 miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4 patricia didn't talk and patricia was replaced with another character 6 the french guy was also a black star ninja 7 chris tucker whoopi and chris rock were added as comic relief 8 ninja strengths came from,0
1287,i couldn't stop watching this movie though it was far past my bedtime br br comparisons to hitchcock are deserved this thing really plays with you it walks a wonderful line between real immediate suspense and a dark distancing humor like many of hitch's heroes our doe eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific and we are taken on quite a ride with her at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy br br the filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out right from the opening shots they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication who is to be trusted and who is a monster the plot twists and turns unpredictably suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork imagery music but most simply the eyes of the characters which sends raw fear right into you br br a warning there is some frighteningly real gore as well as some nudity the horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage slasher pic br br and a teen slasher pic it ain't the characters are quirky and feel like real people for one thing a couple including the heroine you may even find endearing as i did there will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown ups i mean alec guinness is in it briefly and you know he didn't need the work br br pop this in the vcr some night when you can't sleep and don't want to yet,1
1288,i saw this film knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars chris farley and david spade and i have to say that this film is a comic classic it is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious farley is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his dad's right hand man the equally excellent spade to find the funding to save the families business relax put your brain on auto pilot and soak up the fun a great supporting cast features film favourites such as brian dennehy cocoon rob lowe wayne's world and bo derek 10 highly recommended for a good laugh,1
1289,norma had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in the trial of mary dugan and she came through with flying colours from then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills let us be gay was made before but released after the divorcée and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that shearer made her own br br norma first appears without make up as frumpish kitty brown who's main purpose in life is to pander to her very unappreciative husband bob rod la rocque she is hurrying to get him off to his golf game but in reality he is going to see his mistress when helen the mistress comes to the house for a showdown kitty faces the situation with civility but behind closed doors she is a mass of emotions and bob leaves for good br br three years later mrs courtland brown kitty comes to stay as a house guest of the eccentric mrs marie dressler kitty is now a knockout and has a job for her she wants kitty to romance a house guest who in his turn is romancing her grand daughter diane beautiful sally shock horror the man is none other than bob her ex husband kitty carries off the meeting with sophistication and witty repartee there seems to be something strangely familiar about that man and no one is the wiser br br the film then settles down into one of those early very talkie boring drawing room comedies kitty casts a spell over all the men and bob is desperate to start again the women have all the strong roles in this film men are just puppets raymond hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler pass me a cushion get me a drink move this chair instead of diane's harassed fiancé norma shearer is of course the whole show marie dressler adds to her list of eccentric portrayals and sally is a real eyeful as the gorgeous diane,1
1290,one of my favorite movies i like horses i like happy endings and i like walter matthau i miss him and am glad to have a great film like this to remind me why he was so wonderful watch it with your kids or your horse br br the story of an old hard boot horse trainer with kids and down on his luck if you have ever had or appreciated horse racing you will appreciate the rags to riches storyline it may be a little below but not a lot the story is the same one except it is the quarter horse version well acted correct racing terms and equipment and nice racing scenes don't take my word for it get it and make up your own mind,1
1291,i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth this film is forever lodged in my brain for someone who didn't grow up around this film you may have become spoiled by the add cycle we've been in since the mid 90's and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem cool this is as my sis was doped up on better off dead before i saw this of which i raped loved and no one no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the 80's this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comedies because with all the overuse of slow mo the current soundtrack the new tech i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots this is the teen comedy yes,1
1292,that's a weird weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than david lynch's one the special effects are badly made the actors are majorly bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the but it seems to be a crazy movie which pays homage to sect kind of organisations that's surely not the will of frank herbert the author of the six part epic check out david lynch's one that's the perfect tribute to the novels,0
1293,this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and it's a crying shame its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i a l diamond's adaptation and ingrid bergman's flawless performance it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years fifty four when she's on the screen it positively br br this is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish i was around during the swingin' hawn's fashions are as tacky as bergman's are chic that's one minor flaw isn't her character a little too for a gal who still lives with her sister but then again would we have ingrid any other way and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc br br the best compliments i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw and that it left me wanting more speaking of wanting more i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick lenz he resembles griffin dunne in this film this was his film debut and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography as for goldie hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but i can't imagine any other actor in the role either br br since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage y but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all in fact i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty five years because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed but don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer grade a,1
1294,george sanders playing the saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script with the usual good rko cast around it's a non story too bristling with murders and good clean fun br br thread 1 in new york police inspector fernack friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced st comes over from london to try to put things right nice and simple so far but is there really more than 90 000 in the world thread 2 another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother wendy barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the saint fall in love with her to boot including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in cellar there's a creepy shot of him dead and staring and them in a car when they're taking him back to where they'd got him paul as pearly gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this witness the dressing gown at the beginning and the later beguiling comment by st that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet and did too for palm springs fernack was played by jonathan hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from templar to liven him up br br the hays office also made sure you got the picture right all threads are tied up with no bits well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing but if val kilmer's version is your yardstick then don't bother,1
1295,this is not direct cinéma as a matter of fact it is its opposite second installment of filmmaker gypsy trilogy this french work produced by michèle ray gavras is a film masterpiece not pure documentary no fiction by any means instead has chosen different locations of the route from india to spain wherever the rom people have a strong presence and with the help of art directors he has staged several musical numbers that tell us how the gypsies live sing dance struggle and have survived the movie may have strong opposition from those who question the hypothesis that the rom tribe is of indian origin mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the hebrews so in a way it comes as no surprise that they were also persecuted by the nazis but above any anthropological argument this is a work of great beauty strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing,1
1296,i was completely bored with this film melodramatic for no apparent reason every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions then there is a serial killer who apparently can kill one person to get the title of serial killer well the serial killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films br br why oh why i no idea it really really wants to be scary but i think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises just for the record this is in no way is a horror film its most definitely a thriller barely really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film it makes me say in too may words ironically acolytes you take forever to say nothing,0
1297,i just watched this film at an advanced screening i had not read the book and knew nothing of the story but went because the book was voted book of the year by two local colleges so i cannot compare the book with the movie as others have done br br in short i thought this was an incredibly moving story the acting was believable and the insight into afghan culture and political history was both interesting and shocking my oldest friend is iranian american and so i felt an affinity for certain middle eastern values and traditions that were portrayed in the movie as they reminded me of the times i spent with his family br br the themes of friendship family human values and courage under fire are universal and are well developed in the film i won't list the plot details as these can be obtained elsewhere but based on the film's technical aspects the acting and above all its heart wrenching story i would definitely recommend this movie,1
1298,whenever hayao miyazaki does the tri writes directs and animates a movie he makes a classic film for the ages he has done it again with no no br br the story is about a girl fish who is kept on a very tight leash along with her younger sisters by her father a bitter ex human wizard named fujimoto the fish escapes from her father and rides a jellyfish to shore where she is caught up in a operation and finds herself stuck in a bottle this underwater sequence must be one of the most elaborately drawn animated scenes ever undertaken and stands on its own as a reason to search out the theatrical release miyazaki who shows no fear of having a busy scene has outdone himself there were literally hundreds of individually drawn sea creatures of every imaginable size all in motion at the same time br br when the fish escapes the operation while still trapped in the bottle a five year old boy named spots her in the water and is able to break the bottle saving her since she is the result of her father's magic she is capable of magic herself and her father actively tries to retrieve her the boy names the fish just when learns that can speak her father successfully retrieves her back into captivity br br after a war of wills with her father manages to escape again with the ability to change herself into a human she meets up again with in a storm and the story continues from there in many interesting ways there is a cuteness factor in this film rivaling and arguably surpassing that of no totoro joe hisaishi once again provided outstanding musical support br br the story itself is simple as are miyazaki's films in general and should appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers while i haven't viewed it enough to be sure the film doesn't seem to be one which will keep scholars in long discussions as sen to chihiro no did nonetheless this is the ultimate feel good entertainment movie i gave the movie a ten out of ten rating,1
1299,a 1957 roger corman non epic in which a sundry bunch of characters end up in a lead lined valley sic just as stock footage nuclear heck is unleashed it's the end of the world four men with guns two women one an unmarried virgin the other a las vegas show who drinks and smokes guess which one makes it to the end of the movie time passes tensions develop or are supposed to something is in the woods eating radioactive rabbits a mutant monster seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed a million years of evolution on an already living human the result is a laughably bad zip up the back rubber monster who is strangely scared of their only source of fresh water it rains the monster dissolves the remaining two characters the hunk and the virgin set out to repopulate the world as the caption 'the beginning' fills the screen after it transpires that the brief shower of rain had washed all the radioactivity away and dissolved all the monsters running around 'out there' br br the only thing of real note about this is the incredible amount of acting' that goes on in it one of the staple elements of bad and lo budget movie making of the period was the use of curtains in the set design it was cheap finished with one set up pull a curtain across drop a different piece of furniture in front of it and you have a different location in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting br br acting' is a skill in which the actor will get to comment on what's going on outside any building he happens to be in it looks like rain or here they come now and it looks like they've got the sheriff with them that sort of stuff he'll do this by standing to one side of the window reaching across his body and lifting the curtain away from the window but along the axis of the shot ie towards the camera thus enabling him to pretend to look out and tell us what's happening off screen without letting the audience see he's staring at the studio wall three inches away from his nose behind some cheap velvet curtains there was a lot of that in this movie,0
1300,hi i have to say you got some wrong information about the series here the main author was richard carpenter he created the series later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodes br br the first director who did most of the series i think complete series 1 was ian sharp who created the distinct look of robin of sherwood br br did indeed see some of the material and they read the i know this for sure because richard carpenter told it on a con in england last year br br i think this is a masterpiece of television entertainment because it has great characters and cast good costumes and great story lines for me still one of the best tv series ever,1
1301,how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing br br apparently this is director damian heart piece as he's both written and directed it and acted in as well he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians this was his first feature film as far as i know and chances are it's his last br br it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor  but i'd say the story and character's are not believable the screenplay and the directing doesn't give it any boost the director plus  the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner super hands hollywood rules the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as a few decent scenes,0
1302,this movie is based on the game series final fantasy this one particularly is about or final fantasy vii i loved the game and i was very happy to see it be transformed into a movie i loved the cg that was awesome lot's of great fight scenes action and characters to make the movie memorable if your a die hard fan of the game you will love this movie personally i'm not a die hard fan of the games but i am starting to become one br br my favourite character out of final fantasy vii besides cloud would have to be cid i love cid i think he's cute i was amazed how real the cg images were it was amazing it's the game in 3d i had a great time watching the movie and by the way i love the aeons to especially he's great overall i gave this movie a 9 because yes i loved it i thought it was a really really good movie and yes it's on my list of movies to get the characters were amazing loved the cg story was wonderful with lot's of action and fight scenes all in all it's the best movie i've seen yet based on a video game,1
1303,it's been a long time since such an original quite funny black comedy has surfaced if eating raoul is on your top 100 list do yourself a favor and find undertaking betty immediately the subject of death being funny has been attempted before see paul bartel and mary woronov in mortuary academy while that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy undertaking betty is much more steady with a better cast who could imagine that the undertaking business might be fertile ground for an original uplifting and heartfelt comedy i was surprised and you will be too i highly recommend seeing undertaking betty merk,1
1304,this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at 3 or 4 in the morning if at all br br no doubt the film makers responsible for attack of the 50 foot woman thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum all wrapped up in a sci fi allegory br br or maybe it was a tax write off br br either way attack proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances a extreme intoxication b seen on a double bill with any of those jacqueline suzanne movies maybe once is not enough or c just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect pop in attack and you'll feel great guaranteed br br it's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script the rubbery special fx and that four eyed sheriff and i think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in washington d c it's just that memorable br br four stars for attack of the 50 foot woman buy a copy mail it to gloria steinem she'll love you for it,0
1305,this flick which is a k a life in the fast lane is easily one of the least entertaining movies i've seen in a long time i think it was made in mind of the sick twisted and jaded l a women who represent about of the population in the states the characters are all one dimensional even the lead after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors a cheap laugh is attempted and by sticking a cork in the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding oh clever patrick dempsey whose movies are almost always a class act sarcasm plays this devil who changes her life but from what we've seen her life was this series of vignettes to begin with no emotion no laughs no story the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style albiet zero substance in the camerawork otherwise one of the 5 worst films i've seen grade 2 out of 10 an f i think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film i can't stress enough how much you should stay away br br,0
1306,the most disposable movie in the history of cinema this one is a strong contender why wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is color wide screen and leila's walkman a movie which's supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent br br no you' re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the original this psycho 1998 is a giant spoiler br br they could have done something different for instance by casting an actor closer to bloch 's bates an obese man they content themselves with an obnoxious rehash a pox on it and long live alfred hitchcock,0
1307,the essential message one which miller would have surely intended after seeing vichy war crimes trials is that hatred of somebody without rational basis is a waste of life meat loaf's character fred has known lawrence for many years and yet when the time comes at the bidding of his fanatical supporters he allows them to attack a man who is not part of their target group for me this is the crucial message it doesn't matter what lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason animal aggression and anger have blinded fred's union thugs to reality br br a friend of mine suggested i should see the wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it i once conducted an experiment in a role playing game and was shocked to see how normal and level headed people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state which would ultimate threaten them all because it crept in in stages br br fred is the start his la friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong br br the relationship between lawrence and the jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one because lawrence misses the point almost until the end if the bigots force out where is he to go if his family have fled the nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedom br br that big poster it's a fairly famous propaganda piece about american families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail when you see this film watch for the grafitti on the subway train and all the little posters the message lurks there too br br this movie should be on the curriculum of every school especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just extremists in thin disguises,1
1308,movies like this give independent films a bad name this simply a boring compilation of with no structure whatsoever i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned if you want to see a good stoner comedy watch half baked it's no award winner but at least it made me laugh the film was obviously made on a micro budget every scene either takes place in someone's house someone's apartment or some outdoor location if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting i would've ignored the film's budget like in the case of edward burns' films but obviously that's not the case this time around br br i quote robert deniro from a bronx tale when i say there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent everybody in the cast is talented luke wilson alicia witt brittany murphy jeremy sisto all talented performers and they all have been in much better movies the actors give it their all but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script the only scene i found interesting was jack black's cameo where he sings a song about being in the woods and of course there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning which i also found appealing br br the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists many movies are awful but at least you understand their intentions what was intention the world will never know br br my score 2 out of 10,0
1309,i like underdogs so 12 years after having first seen star trek v and thinking it was bizarrely bad i gave it a second watch hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around br br i didn't br br the writing is half baked and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet albeit shakily the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous what was even worse from the original cast's pov is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame including the special effects what an embarrassment br br the final frontier isn't thoroughly wretched i gave it 4 out of 10 but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors yes including the first one that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more br br unless it's an episode with troi's mother in it,0
1310,ok so paris hilton sucks in it typical malibu barbie but the rest of the actors are just great i watched the film last night and it totally kept me going thru out the whole film chad michael murray is and he's just a ace actor total hero man the main girl who is the sister to nick chad is such a brilliant actress thumbs up i think it's so different to films out their these days most of them to go with possessions ghosts but here you have a theme about wax i totally got creepers out by the wax models in the house although they looked so real i still haven't got the story with the twins at the moment i am just waiting to get the dvd then watch it all over again thumbs up to such a great film 11 10 all those people who don't like it please don't bother 2 criticise my opinion as mostly everyone thinks its cool to do so also i think the paris scene when she strips to her underwear is totally inconvenient why not just get a dog shagging some cat be more entertaining then that when paris death scene came up i thought it was poor as she still kept running although a knife just went up her foot hmm interesting br br chad all the way,1
1311,there are not many films which i would describe as perfect but rififi definitely fits the bill no other heist film has come close to it before or after the plot is simple but engrosses you it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it you care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws it's hard to imagine any other actor besides jean in the role of tony le when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony his answer and the expression on his face says it all while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie and rightfully so the film actually gets better afterward the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted a great climactic score during tony's final ride towards his destiny to think that if dassin an american director had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was it certainly wouldn't have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through but he did achieve his greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us i'm just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another there's no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money leave the classics alone,1
1312,see i really wanted to enjoy this movie there were moments when my heart beat faster when the hair on my neck began to stand up when my muscles began to tighten but just like a strip tease i was left with no real action no resolution and money missing from my wallet br br and miguel flores apparently don't know the correct recipe for making a horror movie and as such utilized the old amateur cook's method of throwing everything into the pot br br this movie is really the shining poltergeist amityville and hellraiser all rolled into one amazing i know but true all the flavors are there you can taste each of them they just don't mix well i'm not gonna go down the list of every thing wrong with this movie in short good cinematography mediocre acting worse dialogue br br the real problem with stealing from so many movie plots and combining them into one movie aside from the resulting confusion is while you can have several plots running at one time you can't have several endings and what does do when he runs into this problem just like a freshman in english 101 you end your story with ellipses the little car vanished into the darkness and the end oooh spooky not really and very anticlimactic the ending left me confused and disappointed almost empty br br take your 10 go rent the shining poltergeist and hellraiser scare the pants off yourself have a great time and forget that the darkness ever existed br br,0
1313,this movie was nothing like the book i think the writer of the screenplay must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to gone with the wind and been turned down this was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway the only similarity between this movie and the story it was portraying was the names of the principle characters and the location of the main action none of the events that are shown in the movie happened that way in the book for a gone with the wind fan of both the book and the movie this was deeply disappointing if you loved the book scarlett don't watch this movie hoping to see it played out on the screen they only share the title in common,0
1314,very shortly a bad film if you are looking for pure action and no brain or brain or you are under 15 years old and like bruce willis this is the movie also don't expect the scenario to be consistent or even believeable if you think a little so don't if you just want to enjoy yourself,0
1315,now i love italian horror films the cheesier they are the better however this is not cheesy italian this is week old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs it is amateur hour on every level there is no suspense no horror with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film the special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost or whatever it was supposed to be is around and a string pulling bed sheets up and down oooh can you feel the chills the dvd quality is that of a vhs transfer which actually helps the film more than hurts it the dubbing is below even the lowest bad italian movie standards and i gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious and what do we discover when she finally does look in the attic in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next well i won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see but let's just say that it isn't very novel,0
1316,i am not quite sure i agree with the director of this version of the scarlet pimpernel i imagined sir percy a very calm seemingly lazy aristocrat this particular sir percy appears to be teeming with overwhelming energy and i did not appreciate the houdini james bond mission impossible style escapes that sir percy engineered either in the previous versions wit was the tool for escape not technology neither were the characters of marguerite and adequately portrayed there seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters br br i do not wish to assign any blame for perhaps the reason for my dislike of this movie might simply be a matter of difference in interpretation had the director's interpretation coincided with mine perhaps i might not have been irritated by what seemed to me bad character portrayals br br i much preferred the version from 1982 anthony andrews was quite efficient as the imperturbable calm fop so were jane seymour and ian mckellen in my opinion the style of this period piece seems to have been lost with this latest adaption i recommend sticking with the previous versions either the one from 1934 or the one from 1982 br br,0
1317,i've always liked sean connery but as james bond i've always favored roger moore still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than james bond the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of spectre br br and what designs they are in never say never again spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world br br von sydow's operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side and he's got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs butterworth br br but before sean connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'm' running things at british intelligence edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british too much money with his violent ways i really did enjoy fox's performance he's like the great grandson of colonel blimp br br i also enjoyed carrera she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods when she's scuba diving with connery in the bahamas note how she puts mr shark on case br br will connery do james bond again he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point roger moore's father but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair,1
1318,absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull thank god the 80's are over and god save whatever man was actually born as james bond iii,0
1319,this is precious everything is illuminated is sweetly and sublimely funny from the first delicious line of dialogue oh how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin while elijah wood is charming as ever as jonathan safran foer the real life author of the novel everything is illuminated it's eugene playing jonathan's ukrainian tour guide and translator alex who truly steals this film alex is a hip hop lovin' ukrainian break dancer who along with his grandfather helps jonathan find the woman who saved jonathan's grandfather's life during world war ii the ukrainian countryside has never looked so breath taking i'm thinking of packing it all up and moving to the former soviet state br br the tone of the film however shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for and suddenly this adorable comedy turns into a heart breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was annihilated during the nazi occupation everything is illuminated is about history heritage and the wisdom that can be gained from uncovering the past it's perfect,1
1320,in 1904 tangier a wealthy american woman and her two children are kidnapped by murderous desert pirates who scorn the moroccan government and by doing so kidnap american pestilence which attracts the attention of u s president theodore roosevelt fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert sheik films of the 1940s with a bit of the king and i interjected besides portraying the cloaked mustachioed bloodthirsty leader and his snippy haughty captive sean connery and candice bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp elements of their characters and dialogue and both seem singularly without proper direction the various and anonymous slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary we don't know any of these victims and the big action scenes become blurry noisy montages of sand swept violence on horseback the pluses a much lauded music score by jerry goldsmith oscar nominated but a loser to john williams' jaws fine location shooting and cinematography 1 2 from,0
1321,its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown br br i don't think alan bates has done a better film than this br br its never shown on television the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of 1998 i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn't great due to a dodgy aerial at the time br br i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv it was shown on channel 4 in the early hours of the morning thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience br br i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that when i finally saw the film i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before the film treads a fine line a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes br br the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste br br a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila br br it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he's being like this br br i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful br br izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw br br it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed br br this is one of the best british films of the 70s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day,1
1322,this movie travels farther on 8 gunshots 2 kisses and 100 clichés than should be possible yet it still works brilliant br br as i was driving home from the theater i tried to figure out how it got away with movie staples like the pages of a novel manuscript blowing across a beach or the impossible series of fortuitous coincidences without the entire audience standing up and screaming i've seen that a million times before and you've pushed beyond the edge of believability but the actors were so enchanting and the screen so filled with believable extras that i forgot to care a friend who saw it with me said it transported him to paris so perfectly that he was disappointed when we left the theater and realized we were still in indiana br br overall a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety wit and elan,1
1323,i have been a huge rush fan ever since moving pictures and this concert is simply and example to everyone who is a fan why rush is so popular they completely admitted to playing their biggest concert yet and despite the rain in a soccer arena they still manage to give an outstanding performance from start to finish a real example of this is during the entire crowd start to sing along to it in a real classic manner in perfect they really play all of everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful lust that rarely happens anymore you get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts given the second dvd is a fascinating documentary of the band while they are in brazil and shows you a lot of the backstage things going on and it allows you to see them not just a musicians but as actual people in their everyday life this dvd gift set is a must for any rush fan young and old and is definitely a keeper for your dvd collection their is even a cd of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music this dvd is worth it,1
1324,i first saw this as a kid the little rascals first went on tv the year i was born and fairly recently bought this on dvd in between i watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1 the pie fight itself and 2 how racist some of these parts were farina as a slave doing voodoo for example i think roach and would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now br br notice how the pie fights in the three stooges' holiday and in the sweet pie and pie resemble this one and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with harry cohn at columbia pictures there was obviously some inspiration from ss and laurel hardy's the battle of the century for these films remember at that time they all stole from the best each other br br one more note laurel hardy buffs that bake sale lady was none other than dorothy coburn who also appeared in the getting into her car and getting it in the rear end it always escapes me why she was never credited,1
1325,a wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it's initial liftoff based on a true story one of the many small stories prior to ww ii that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon viewed at the stony brook film festival the film was enthusiastically received well written and expertly cast the characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations,1
1326,completely worth checking out saw it on birthday 2006 and it hit me big time sometimes it feels like we're all in a trap and are doomed to repeat the past no matter how much we try to change all we can do is to keep on going and speaking out just keep on going don't mean to be a downer because that's not the point but maybe we need to get down before we see how much we need to work on ourselves what happens when we keep being told by the best people like mlk what needs to happen to pull us out of our dead end road but we don't listen i know that some of us do listen but how do we get the rest of the world to see things as they really are just keep going i guess this movie got me thinking even more about all of this so i guess it has done what it set out to do that's what i consider to be a good movie or play or book or poem or speech or anything something that gets you thinking and keyed up to move in an active direction instead of sitting stuck and bored and hopeless,1
1327,i found this movie on one of my old videos after godzilla vs the sea monster which should instantly give you an idea of it's tone and i hadn't seen it in a while so i decided to watch it i didn't remember much about rainbow except i used to like the cartoon and that it was cute most people feel that way about her you probably do to br br well when the movie started i wondered if it was the right one it didn't fit the mold of rainbow as i remembered her but it turns out she kicks butt this has to be the strangest animated movie ever i can't believe these characters were so popular the series isn't much different while being so bizzare as soon as i watched this movie again it became one of my favorites br br i really don't want to give too much away just know that if you see the movie in the video store rent it and watch it no questions asked you will get a kick out of it especially the outrageous princess character and the robotic horse and the hypnotized sprites br br if you can't tell by know this is an 80's cartoon that is really an undiscovered head movie in disguise have fun,1
1328,when i first saw this i thought it was a joke all i could think was you get the 8mm camera i'll get my little brother's monster toys we'll make a movie why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci fi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80's with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian a script that was written by the director's 4 year old son a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop poverty row special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous the end result wasn't spectacular complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity from venus must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie br br a 2 out of 10 for a valiant hopeless effort br br,0
1329,this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another when he almost certainly would have used a sponge is one of the annoying things flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody and he did not end up on skid row in sydney he did not get his role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well dressed film star br br this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos,0
1330,when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about i felt very curious but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life technically speaking the sound is poor you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix of all the photography is mediocre some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles and the way the cinematographer achieves that dark night is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights there's no reference used of the moonlight my god but not least most of the ac are really poor it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier her performance it's pretty poor br br great disappointing shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars,0
1331,created in 1928 and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesn't matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and minnie mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them mickey helps her crank it's tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey peel potatoes mickey mouse was number 53 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest cartoons very good,1
1332,this is a terrible movie don't waste your money on it don't even watch it for free that's all i have to say,0
1333,hi i am john and i would like to tell you all that my dog was in this film at the baiting screen he was the pit like one that was going to bite the man chained up my dogs name was colin and he stayed away filming for a week for this film he was also in other things like crime watch uk and some other small parts he won some dog shows but he has passed away now i miss him he was a great true and loyal dog and we had some great times together but he got cancer which could not be treated so i had to get him put down that was the worst day of my life i hope this gives you some thing to look for in the film if you watch it again br br thanks all,1
1334,viewing both of these films concurrently is not a bad idea to get a sense of early film production and acting for the camera styles i give the nod to garbo but not by much in regard to her naturalness robeson is majestic but his performance is aimed for a large proscenium theater something else that struck me was the movies themes of empowerment for women and minorities there hadn't been any films coming out of hollywood yet that allowed the voices of marginal characters like anna and brutus to take the foreground these were very progressive films for their time it's quite probable that o'neill saw the writing on the wall way before everyone else did about the future of america,1
1335,mame is a disgrace to many things to lucille ball to a story which has been told better many times over and to the musical genre altogether ms ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated bea arthur is good but it is not enough the production is very shoddy and cheap looking the songs are sub par and nearly every joke misfires also lucy couldn't dance well so the music had to be slowed down to a pace avoid at all costs but do see the delightful auntie mame,0
1336,i came across this movie in an australian hotel room at 3 am my brother and i were channel surfing and who do we see but a young russel crowe but not the telephone throwing russel crowe we had come to know and quasi love back in the states this movie much to my surprise was amazingly creative and hilarious it stars a cast of awkward teens with hilarious stories of odd sexual experiences including a slick salesman prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother if you are lucky enough to come across this film i would strongly suggest picking it up i have to say this movie was amazingly entertaining and i thank the fine people of australia making it,1
1337,i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now the acting is ridiculous half the cast must be retired porno actors and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting br br the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen i think there are puppet shows with more believability they can't even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of their pistols can hold br br if asked to summarise the movie i would say that someone had up a group of complete no hopers at the local county fair slapped them on an island added needlessly intense music and let a 6 year old do the editing br br i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released recorded on dvd and costs 6 from my local video store for one day if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film br br i hate this movie with great intensity why i wish i knew captain i wish i knew,0
1338,first i am a teenager ok and i have to say this movie was pretty good i think any kid ten and under will like it but people my age an up might be a little um a well we'd describe the movie as lame but i liked it it may be that i still act like a kid or i visit a cattle farm every weekend but this movie was cute i did like how the actors were like kids not little blonde cutesy pies wearing three layers of clothes a trendy hat and about a thousand like most shows today to name a few drake josh lizzie mc guire well any kid show and the setting was perfect but there was a flaw the family was in debt right why in the world did their internal house look like something out of a western versace store that was one flaw br br the cameos are great there's about five hundred of them and the only explainable one is julia roberts being the main little girl's aunt how in the world did they get everyone else this movie seemed to be on a tight type budget br br i liked this movie it was a fun one to watch and i thought some parts were far fetched like a cow selling for 750 000 ha my butt a cow sells for that much but otherwise it was good i liked it and i could watch it again but i'd never buy it there's not even special features on the dvd what's up with that but do rent it especially if you have little kids running around the house,1
1339,i'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie even my 4 and 6 year old were bored the chipmunks are cute but the storyline is overly obvious not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes br br we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance but i wondered why br br i don't admit to ever being a fan but i expected to be entertained it's not even an movie as far as i can tell simply a heavy handed view of too young we've seen more than enough of that with britney spears et al haven't we br br don't bother,0
1340,the frozen limits is a big screen vehicle for the artists known as the crazy gang they were a group of british entertainers who formed in the early 1930s in the main the group's six men were bud allen jimmy teddy knox charlie naughton and jimmy gold hugely popular in the variety halls the group were also darlings of the then royal family the plot here sees them as the wonder boys troupe who set off to seek their fortunes in alaska after reading about a gold rush in the newspaper only problem is is that when they finally get to red gulch it turns out they are 40 years too late br br i often cringe when i see the statement it's very british because it implies that those not of the british isles may struggle to get it the reason it bothers me is because in this www internet age i have garnered a ream of non british film loving friends who have been known to split their sides at the best of ealing will hay and the imperious terry thomas so then is it true that something such as the frozen limits is unlikely to be appreciated by a non british audience well yes it's true so much here is british but really it has to be said that the classic movie fan is pretty well versed in history and when all is said and done the visual mirth here is universal with the anarchic not so wild west make over an absolute winner a winner that has every chance of being more appreciated by an american audience now than it will be by a british audience not all the comedy works and in truth the big 6 are trumped big time by a film stealing moore marriott but there are skits and parodies here that deserve respect and a nod of approval from more illustrious comedy acts you are unlikely to nearly fall off your chair like i did because of an gag but if you be a classic comedy film fan i feel sure that you will at the worst acknowledge there's some very talented people at work here br br now then dose the mounties always get their man 8 10,1
1341,if you came here it's because you've already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it br br i feel for you i really do and i profusely apologize as a canadian because that's what we do that this film ever had to cross your eyes if only for a moment i hear there is no cure for the bleeding reported out of every dozen cases br br i like everyone else rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade i thought sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie i'll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie br br and for the record i saw the movie but did not watch it the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer i swear to god br br you know what i'm not writing anymore about this it's just too painful,0
1342,while the writing was terrible the acting was atrocious the only thing that saved this turd was the breast count but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie this was a new low for troma lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team the best place to show this movie would be to invalids sense they can't get up to change the channel to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts,0
1343,this is one of chaplin's first national films from the period between his glorious mutual shorts and the more mature united artists features more opulent than the mutual films it continues chaplin's quest for perfecting his comic expression most people forget that the film is actually a dream that charlie has while awaiting being sent off to the front br br there is plenty of slapstick via the limburger cheese being used to gas the enemy and chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree br br by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves doubtless this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspective br br as far as i am concerned familiarity with the entirety of chaplin's work should be a prerequisite for all cinephiles do not delay,1
1344,forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book so what this is a film after all it is a sheer joy to watch made entirely on location in gorgeous photography but with dark disturbing moments as well the only problem i have is with the obvious miscasting of nicolas cage as captain apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise,1
1345,i know a lot of people have said don't bother with this movie because its not a good fighting flick and hard with the subtitles that is a really lazy way to think of a movie if you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art this being a masterful piece of work if you want to watch this its not about the fighting really there are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part this is not the basic kung fu movie the story is really the central focus and not the fights and the combination of the two make an excellent movie thats well worth watching and is even better in the original language with subtitles,1
1346,this film was released in the uk under the name blood rites it was banned outright and never submitted again for release br br as the ghastly ones it was supposedly a hit with the horror hungry denizens of new york city's famed 42nd street grindhouse circuit if you are looking for some bloody horror then you will find it in this film br br unfortunately to see the disabled colin hal chomp down on a live rabbit you have to put up with shaky 16mm camera work that makes ed wood look positively marvelous br br three sisters are to spend three days in the family homestead with their husbands before the old man's money is naturally in such a situation people start dropping dead family secrets are exposed and lots of blood is spilled especially during a gruesome dismemberment br br maybe it was the bunny bit that the brits objected to i know i did,0
1347,the movie is about paul a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital and his friends victor viktor who during his education in england started to think he was adolf hitler peter who took to much lsd and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity he is with china beatle has spent most time at the hospital although viktor is slightly older then him he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by telepathy br br the novel is better then the movie and covers all of pauls life from birth to his death there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover pauls childhood br br is funny sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now and read the novel first it makes the movie better,1
1348,a dark yet humorous tale involving a cop who has a first hand experience with vampires and decides he must quit his job to pursue these evil beings most of the film contained questionable acting plot props and filming the fight scenes were as hokey as a middle schooler's rendition of a wwii battle the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there the props were bad because they did not even look like they could function in the slightest amount the majority of the film appeared to be shot in someones basement in some scenes you could see the rafters overhead in a scene that was not supposed to look like that of a basement the plot had no motivation to move forward or go backwards it just appeared to stand still at times with no reason for some characters actions i felt at times the sounds effects were out of place for this horror type genre and more of a cartoon series it is similar to the movie blade in that he is an african american vampire hunter however that is where all similarities end and the movie looks closer to a saturday night live spoof,0
1349,i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others june whitfield kenneth williams jaques and peter butterworth are fine but barbara windsor looks tired and sid james is just tacky joan sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful charles hawtrey its just plain sad when you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch the homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very unpleasant experience the set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in england the sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here it looks like a cheap production you will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series,0
1350,being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club this also includes apes chimps and orangutans i am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys 100 days for monkeys to do what they do best cause mischief shenanigans solve human problems and teach us about ourselves br br the story is simple enough in short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants luckily there's a few monkeys chimpanzees that have a bounty on their head that would get boba fett or dog's duane chapman blood flowing as the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself his family his grandpa the local weirdo flirts with a girl twice his age and learns the beast way to deal with bullies is to have someone point a shotgun at them br br there within lies the problem so much focus is put on the boy that the chimps just don't get the screen time they deserve the chimps are not as talented as the chimp s that play jack from the m p trilogy or the legendary orangutans that play or clyde 1 or 2 so don't watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the chimp genre the chimps hit some sweet flips which is what the film needed more of there is an epic scene of the chimps breaking into the poor families house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the film for this scene alone br br so in closing this movie is not for the serious monkey movie enthusiast i wouldn't recommend this movie to families as it encourages a childs rebellion against their parents i can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children,0
1351,in the wake of my personal research into the pending end cycle time of 2012 presented by the mayan calendar system i believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as what the bleep do we know while some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level speak the elegant universe breaks such barriers the visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics there are numerous messages in this movie the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what's being taught true pure discovery science is beautiful because there's always something additional and exciting to bring to the fore if we have the courage to seek it out in the face of established science,1
1352,this is a movie that will brighten up your day for sure kermit the frog is just an ordinary frog in his swamp when a talent agent stops by and tells him that hollywood is looking for frogs to be in movie lol on the way kermit meets fozzie bear miss piggy gonzo and his chicken camilla rowlf the electric mayhem bunsen and beaker but also trailing kermit is the proprietor of a restaurant chain doc hoppers french fried frog legs all things considered though kermit and the muppets make it to hollywood br br this movie is recommended for everyone young and old br br it has some wonderful musical numbers like the rainbow connection i'm going to go back there someday and movin' right along the muppets also use many forms of transportation in this movie kermit rides a bike fozzie drives a and another car gonzo takes flight with a bundle of helium balloons which is one of my favorite moments by the way and kermit and the rest of the muppets finally go the rest of the way by the electric bus dr teeth floyd janice scooter and animal who meet up with them in the desert after car breaks down br br even some sesame street muppets make cameo appearances i e big bird is walking along on the road on the way to nyc to break into public television the end is also a very heartwarming moment every single muppet created is in the final scene along with a final rainbow connection reprise br br but those poor muppets worked so hard on their movie set then it all comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks you'd think everything is ruined and destroyed but the rainbow comes shining through the roof at the end and it all sums up the magic of this film and you know everything will be all right br br perfect 10 10 watch it and you'll be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie,1
1353,could contain spoilers read only after seeing last episode season 2 think about it the guys on the north pole center of the earth looking for abnormal magnetic behavior they also said something about did we miss it again so there was another abnormality of course that was when the plain crashed i think this whole island is a setup set up by her daddy she found out about it and is looking for her desmond how else can she know what to look for br br so basically it's an island in a magnetic shield all of it is fake all the signs are there fake beards fake doors fake medicine fake observations stations with fake air shafts that lead to nothing it's a project indeed and because of the final scene in the season 2 finale i know it has to do something with desmond his chick and her dad and probably libby she's weird maybe she actually has something to do with the plane crashing ok now i'm drifting off br br also in this episode henry gail tells michael to go to some coordinates and he'll find rescue their this is probably some sort of door in the magnetic shield once you're gone there is no way back br br i think it's pretty obvious despite of the numerous questions i still have and hope to get answers for in the next season if you think back on what we've learned in season 1 and 2 i'm sure we'll get loads of answers in season 3 br br can't wait br br can anyone agree on this theory hope to hear from you,1
1354,oooooh man was i pleased i didn't miss this i wanted to post this review as this episode in particular does what a certain recent movie did not it pays true homage to the game doom its plot is different yes and the characters are obviously set in an entirely different universe obviously the doctor who universe however the feel the pace the references and the location are perfect and for all original doom fans listen out for the door opening and closing sound effect it was the icing on the cake for me br br please all doctor who and doom fans alike check this one out its a gem,1
1355,in this film we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with what was the point of making the film then to show that it would have been better not to have had in cold blood a book i admire incidentally in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact hardly he behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book so his degradation is a matter of degree are we supposed to care enough about capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer perry smith are kindred spirits with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none mr capote's plight didn't touch me at all i'm afraid so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me but even if i could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect while keener and cooper are so warm and interesting that i was yearning for more of them dreary beyond belief,0
1356,now first let me say i love god awful movies especially horror films mainly i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain but this is the absolute worst film on the planet i had to turn it off it was so bad it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable give me 3 back to back viewings of manos the hands of fate or monster a go go over this any day avoid this film like the now excuse me while i go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film only one decent gag in the part i watched was the now are an extermination pair for exterminators even that wasn't to great of a gag,0
1357,if you need a clue as to whether is decent or not look to its star colin firth who refers to it in an interview as absolute rubbish i sincerely hope no one ever sees it br br the script and plot are ludicrous the female lead is unconvincing the only thing worthwhile is colin firth and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout br br for diehard firth fans only the shower scene alone is worth the 3 99 you might have to shell out should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did br br i'm happy for mr firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over,0
1358,most of wayne's b westerns are kind of fun in a naive way but this one really stinks the editing is terrible and the direction and pacing is completely lethargic most of the cast stands around waiting for the mute guy to write down his thoughts on a pad of paper and i was bored sorry duke but this gets a 1,0
1359,nothing really unpredictable in this movie but a solid flick in all respects everything from acting to cinematography was solid not a perfectly linear plot line but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming perhaps a tad melodramatic at points but again a fairly decent movie none the less definitely worth checking out if in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend give this a go though you may not feel like running out and buying it i found it to be quite worth while,1
1360,i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown the interest waned early a simple premise in scenery five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there let alone know how in the hell they got there confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and distrust the men learn that a kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages now the men size each other up trying to distinguish if all are victims and who may actually be one of the kidnappers the cast includes jim caviezel greg kinnear joe pantoliano bridget moynahan barry david selby and adam rodriguez,0
1361,i rented this movie because the dvd cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night we ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film and watched copper mountain instead i don't know if any of you have seen copper mountain but it isn't great either however i would have to say that the alan thick jim carrey duo made it a more enjoyable watch br br i later finished puddle cruiser this movie was slow and the humor was forced this movie reminded me of some stinkers that i saw in some of my earlier production classes in college i was left wondering was this the film that enabled broken lizard to make supertroopers also how could this movie suck so bad supertroopers was good and club dread was decent don't see this movie,0
1362,i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time first off the plot was uninspired at least the animation was even worse we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a version of g i joe i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines where were we oh yeah the performance well it was totally flat lacking passion and talent if i am excused now as for the dialogs just like the acting no memorable quotes nothing that someone wouldn't expect let's just hope the movie will be decent at least,0
1363,the idea is not original if you have seen such kind of story before you would know what the ending would come out after watching for the first twenty minutes the script the positioning of the actors and the screening is too obvious if you haven't seen such story before it is definitely a good experience you will enjoy the twist at the end don't forget to watch it again after you know the truth you will even more enjoy the plots even though i have a right guess at the very beginning i still couldn't help stick on my seat till the end br br conclusion a must see this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood br br don't miss it,1
1364,unless you want to be bored half to death i've never been a fan of gus van sant and as part of what previous posters have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film's ridiculous storyline which is pretty much enforcing to the viewing masses that are social rejects and should be blamed for crimes as a skater myself i watch a lot of skate films and the filming during the skate scenes which is obviously a major part of the plot as the lead protagonist is a skateboarder was awful and bourne identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect this film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the soundtrack which just adds to the media myth that all are white rockers simply just a really bad film,0
1365,another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden it doesn´t work except for still unsurpassed stormare does the best he can i suppose and some scenes are mildly effective but the plot is full of holes why does hamilton continue the attack on the base knowing that his wife is held hostage it was fun to see mark hamill but his bad guy part was very underwritten i´m constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible functioning script 1 out of 5,0
1366,gregory peck and gig young are competing for the same girl and after peck sends young on a very dangerous mission they blame him for his reasons feeling guilty peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort where they are outnumbered by the indians peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers ward bond lon chaney jr neville brand among others are excellent the script is derived from a novel by charles marquis warren who was a specialist in westerns as a writer director and producer the idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including the dirty dozen made in 1967,1
1367,i cannot argue with other comments that the story line focuses more on the romance between the mary martin and allan jones characters much in the manner of showboat than on the life of victor herbert but in the 1930's would that have been a box office draw instead of the life of vh perhaps it should have been the music of vh there is an abundance of this br br for me the thrill of the movie came near the end of the movie when susanna foster sings land of romance it has been over a decade since i caught this movie for a second time at a local 'old movies' theater at first the audience was stunned then it burst into spontaneous applause i remember the shivers running up and down my spine my trivia memory recalled the information provided to an inquiring public by a local journalist when the movie first came out back in the late 1930's 'that note hit by miss foster was a far f above high c ' br br she may not have had four octaves a la but the then teen ager certainly had a range,1
1368,i felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for eleanor the primary actors campbell scott jennifer beals yancy butler james goodwin iii patrick stewart and leslie caron were very well selected and played their parts with excellence it was a very uplifting movie that i wish was available on tape or dvd a rare gem,1
1369,this was an awful short film that tries to be funny in a dark way but wasn't funny at all say at a film festival in chicago it really is what the title says and i simply wasn't into it at all the bad storytelling was what did it in if you re wrote it and re shot it it might work this attempt fell in the hole horrible filmmaking,0
1370,this is one the worst movie i've seen and certainly worst movie has made i can't believe person who has created movie like teen can create utter crap like this br br plot of the film itself is really faulty that zeenat has to search meera and get her to help her husband avoid death penalty in arabia common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so won't the government so zeenat can safely forge signature or thumb print and produce it before the another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address in his passport so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime meera gets suitcase through government wow doesn't it make well networked in india more than indians br br makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of chopra who is eyeing meera and seeks father in law girish this guy is just wasted 's help to get her as a keep br br cannot speak hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the english dialogs he writes in hindi this time it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication when writing dialogs like ki leap of honesty within minutes to our worst nightmares meera not only takes this honest leap she taps her feet to do ka dance of honesty br br one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues but since bollywood has learned the thing called post production almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops so no big deal br br conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to chopras or johars or barjatyas and all are ready to get affected,0
1371,i just got home from seeing radio i've not seen such an inspiring story in a long time my kids are ages 8 and 5 and i would like to take them so that they may feel the message as i did you should seek to find the best in people and love them for who they are not judge them for their differences cuba gooding jr and ed harris both deserve academy awards for this movie i don't know why we can't have more movies like this rather than the junk that is served up at theatres on a daily basis,1
1372,this is definitely a girl movie my husband found it utterly boring but i think this is a really sweet movie it's amazing to think that just a note can bring so many people together this is a great get away for anyone who loves a cute funny romance,1
1373,i only saw the first part of this and concluded that i wouldn't miss anything if i didn't watch the second episode the cinematography was ok but apart from this the plot was just as and run of the mill as any other war story the actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and the make up is really bad with his white hair and kai respectively as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense i mean if you've watched more than two or three movies about wwii as most of us have then you'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot but roland richter seems to afraid of doing so you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative tv channel while watching this movie millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative german film making these millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies but no let's give to some director who'll make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means my advice read joseph heller or kurt vonnegut instead they'll tell you what war is like or give me one million euros and i make a better film than this load of bs and another thing why is it that german movies only get to be nominated for the oscars when the movie deals with wwii or the holocaust probably because that is the only thing german film making is good at and that should get us thinking shouldn't it,0
1374,pat o'brien portrays the all american notre dame football coach no doubt this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of all american notre dame football probably it's most interesting to serious followers of football and or notre dame football you will see some good documentary style film footage br br otherwise it's difficult to recommend this as a film it's not much more than an historical document you'll know the end is near when gale page gets a chill and don't blink or you'll miss ronald reagan doing of all things camille br br all american 1940 lloyd bacon pat o'brien gale page ronald reagan,0
1375,the movie is a starter to what really happened in city i'm a grandchild of the people who really lived the story the truth never has come out to my knowledge i have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it city is still run by crooked people albert patterson was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe the story was filmed in city it still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie the funeral home still looks exactly the same but if you are wanting the real history of sin city you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about ma and her kindness she didn't get the name ma for nothing,1
1376,david cronenberg movies are easily identifiable or at least elements within the movie stand out as his trademarks fetishism the blurring between the organic and squishy throbbing things that shouldn't be squishy and throbbing is classic cronenberg briefly it's about a future generation of computer games but instead of a video monitor visuals are supplied by your mind the game plugs directly into a in the base of your spine and while the game is running the player can't tell reality from game jennifer jason leigh plays the game's developer guiding a marketeer jude law through the game's paces while in the game they uncover strange goings on and possible crimes but are they real or is it the game not even the game's author knows br br the movie is quite a treat keeping the viewer engaged but in the dark until the final minutes another thing i like about is that it doesn't use a heavy reliance on special effects it's the story itself that propels the movie recommended for the saturday night when science fiction is called for,1
1377,when i watched this movie i had no idea what it was about and i had never heard of it before but i must say i was positively surprised the first few minutes are almost the most funny of the whole movie the store clerk from india is just too funny anyways the story isn´t really too much to talk about but i think it´s ok the acting on the other hand is quite good and still the only actor i recognized was mickey rourke who wasn´t really in the movie until the ending and the ending is where the turn off is i think it´s not bad but i don´t feel like it really ends i feel like there should have been something more a final battle in some way i don´t know all in all this was a good movie and i recommend it to anyone into tarantino type movies with loads of violence and dark sinister humor i rate it 7 10,1
1378,this is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school early high school age kids maybe to them it's funny they may possibly even see something scary in it to me the acting is poor and plot is poor there's just not much value at all for the adult viewer i saw this film as weak and boring at times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized the creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds they don't seem to have any substance other than the look at times i wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again this movie just wasn't good for me,0
1379,possibly john cassavetes best film to date and definitely his funniest seymour cassel plays the young moskowitz smitten with real life wife of cassavetes gena rowlands excellent as usual a must see gem of a film if you can locate it,1
1380,very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins 1964 and bedknobs and broomsticks 1971 the human cast is very distinguished james mason billie whitelaw david tomlinson joan greenwood bernard cribbins but their roles range from the miscast a 69 year old mason as a thieving chimney sweep to the inconsequential greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat to the bizarre whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters including a circus performer an old hag a maid and a fairy for no apparent reason br br the animated segment of the film handled by a group of east european animators is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and as usual with this type of thing there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed far more successfully other children's films namely the railway children 1970 and the amazing mr 1972 which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk,0
1381,what we're given in this trying to be trendy film is a frat pack of college friends now approaching age 30 which we all know of course their generation thinks of as the new 20 consisting of four guys and a gal we have thrust at us the following types seemingly and frequent drug users along with one individual who is job successful and one who is trying to be they are all in their own way drifting while trying to find both a future and emotional happiness with one possibly two exceptions these are people this reviewer would definitely never care to come close to modeling myself after there is disappointment after disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives except in the instance of one individual who appears on the way to finding it none appears headed toward emotional satisfaction in his her life and so about the only sincere moment in this film is when a knock at the door brings to the person answering it an unexpected and heartfelt i love you br br with only the exceptions mentioned these people are the kind hardly deserving or worthy of several hundred thousands of dollars being thrown away in presenting their stories br br ps writer director johnson definitely appears to have a problem with showing gay sexual scenes with no such problems in presenting more prolonged and revealing heterosexual ones why might that be br br,0
1382,well i read the other comments didn't think it sounded any good but decided to tape it anyway perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie because of course i would be noticing all the same weird things excessive use of fade to black a few weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times but noticing all that i thought to myself well this would probably be really boring if it was all going chronologically the conversations aren't that exciting but kind of mandatory and the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part skipping the boring bits at the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too will they survive br br so i actually liked this movie no not really the director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters but he is overdoing it it gets annoying and sometimes confusing this was apparently only the second movie he directed so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future and if you're sitting there in the future reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch well if he is good in the future sure watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one otherwise this movie isn't really worth watching unless you very interested in film making and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable,0
1383,this is a movie that has all the basic elements of its genre it makes you wanna cry it makes you laugh it disgust you it makes you angry etc br br the topic of the story is fortunately not about some disease or drugs what is the common trend in gay themed movies in these days but it focuses on the social interactions between characters what could be considered not to be in the high school elite the play and the direction could be a little bit more sophisticated but on the other hand it's somehow better so because it really shows the distress of the characters that they are experiencing if this was intended then this is a remarkable job and assuredly an achievement specially for such an young director br br it's actually a good story that gives you a little inside into how it is to be a fat girl and to acknowledge it to yourself,1
1384,this is a great movie the best role peter strauss ever did the music is good the message harsh the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw only in the seventies did they make them like this one,1
1385,where do i begin let me say that after having watched the entire film and the special features on the dvd my wife and i watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running i can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film it's worth hearing br br i'm not a southern boy but i spent some time around memphis a long time ago and have a feel for the area this film almost smells of the south it's so real samuel jackson one of my all time favorite actors is magnificent as the emotionally bent lazarus and christina ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as rae a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life i've always liked ms ricci's work but in this performance she's giving 137 of herself every second she's on the screen awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film br br there are other places where you can read the essence of the story so i'm just commenting on the work i'd heard the name justin timberlake before seeing bsm but had no idea what he looked like or even why he's famous bumping my head on 60 years old i'm outside his target demographic to say the least after seeing this film i will recognize him he can act he gives a substantial believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut br br the director is from memphis and shows reverence for his home region he is also a fine story teller br br and i must mention the music i love blues and the soundtrack for black snake moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan br br i'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure see this film and i mean now,1
1386,this is actually the first movie i ever saw in a theatre where the people didn't leave immediately when the end credits started in stead they remained seated for a few minutes gaping with their mouths open staring in the infinite trying to understand what they 've just seen br br the only thing i can say try to go watch this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible so did i i gave it a 10,1
1387,this was truly a heart warming movie it is filled with so many messages loyalty friendship sickness death and the paranoia society has concerning anything they don't understand i have shed a few tears during certain movies but this movie kept the tears flowing,1
1388,i bought this on vhs as terror hospital and when i got home i checked imdb and was like omg it's the legendary nurse sherri so here's another one from al adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film making since the blood of dracula's castle days where that earlier effort is a more or less totally lump this one mixes it up a little adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence sure half of the movie is a blind post op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind or nurse sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork or a wee bit of abstract student film quick cutting to go with the pulsing blob effects in the possession scene or the most gratuitously half hearted topless bit ever or god knows what else i forget to be honest as dumb ass pieces of sh t go this one runs toward the high end congrats al,0
1389,although copies of this movie are hard to find if you can find it get it i believe this was aside from in the navy abbott and only musical although they twisted the plot around a little i've never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable jack and the greedy butcher mr slightly reminiscent of was a lady this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor only to get up and dance as lou costello sings i don't know why they didn't do that in other films,1
1390,the lousiest of all lousy jaws rip offs was regretfully made by one of my all time favorite directors lamberto bava here under his john old jr pseudonym you know how it goes in these cheap european imitations right they only want their monstrous animal to be be bigger sicker and more threatening but this more than often results in the opposite effect bava's creature is a humongous sea devil and it's more than just a shark we're seemly dealing with a prehistoric monster here with the jaws and appetite of a great white but it also has tentacles like an octopus it's up to a couple of dolphin loving to discover how this monster was able to survive all these thousands of years and why exactly he only started his killing spree now the script of monster shark makes few to no sense and most of the action takes place on the mainland the shark itself is an unintentionally laughable creation and it was a wise decision of lamberto bava to only show it vaguely and in quick flashes the acting performances are above average and the underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well handled the twists in the plot are predictable and you'll probably have the most fun spotting detailed facts about the characters for example count all the cans of beer dr hogan drinks throughout the whole movie,0
1391,1 thing this movie sucks big time i was into singaporean comedy when rice war came along but this time even singh well done acting cant pull this one of a total failure of following shaolin soccer next time do ur own thing,0
1392,i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful br br awfully long even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life br br awfully boring the parts they included were long winded and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained br br awfully inaccurate the side to this film was a joke and last time i checked khan wasn't exactly a nice guy br br awfully acted i found several of the characters hard to believe they were very two dimensional and lacked and kind of depth br br a saving grace of the film was the cinematography that is why i gave this film a 2 star rating rather than the bare minimum however if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead br br all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss,0
1393,mildly entertaining and self consciously cheezy but what else could it possibly be cushing in one of his poorest roles and he often sounds dubbed mcclure is just too cheezy to be believed but who can blame him in the wasteland of this movie whose plot about ancient dinosaur birds ruling humans has 19th century throwback period charm but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the racist connotations of the literary genre into films nice effort from the actors but a poorly conceived production,0
1394,steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking this is because it was the first sound cartoon while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 br br now if this were just an important historical film it would be worth seeing especially to lovers of animation however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is while mickey and minnie behave a bit odd compared to the characters we have grown to love thanks mostly to the kooky mind and talent of animator ub there is an infectious charm about the film it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among best films even after 80 wonderful years,1
1395,the main reason i loved this movie is because formerly immature were in it they were in house party 3 when they were 11 but they are all grown up now i was a little shocked at some of the things they were doing in the movie almost ready to tear my hair out but i had to realize that they were not my little boys anymore i think chris did a pretty good job considering that is was his first movie,1
1396,i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it it is so sweet and heartwarming a real tear jerker i was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie it's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through it's something anybody can relate to i really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a saturday night rental with your girlfriends your family your boyfriend everyone will really enjoy it d it's a real story about a real family that would pull at anyones heartstrings not to mention beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting see it i'm sure you'll love it as much as i did,1
1397,this film really misses the mark on most fronts the accents are laughably weak the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best br br they've got a great idea it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above br br the writer seems to think by putting the word f ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard he's no brick top thats for sure br br next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film br br it's a crime to compare this to films like the business lock stock and snatch,0
1398,andy mcdermott tom everett scott is a shy american teenager spending vacation in paris with his friends brad and chris andy saves the gorgeous julie delpy from committing suicide in eiffel tour and has a crush on her he does not know that she is a werewolf they go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf he is advised that the only way to become normal again is killing the werewolf that attacked him and eating its heart this movie is a violent black humor movie the special effects and the soundtrack are excellent highlighting the song of the band bush i do not know why some readers compares this movie with the masterpiece 'an american werewolf in london' the stories have nothing in common only an american teenager werewolves and a city in europe highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor movies my vote is seven br br title brazil um em paris an american werewolf in paris,1
1399,i've never seen a movie get a worse release then this and that's a shame as this is the funniest film of the year you would think an ad with the line from the director of office space would be enough to warrant a big release but there are no ads no posters no website i doubt the stars even knew it came out this weekend what is 20th century fox thinking mike judge's sci fi comedy is set in but it could come true in about 10 years if things continue as they are luke wilson and maya rudolph get frozen in a top secret army experiment and wake up in a future full of consumer zombie inbred retards the film reminds me of woody allen's sleeper robocop planet of the apes blade runner and network and the late great futurama try to see it before fox burns all the prints,1
1400,walter matthau can always improve a mediocre film and this movie proves it he turns in a very realistic performance as a small time horse trainer and single father not sugar coating either role br br he can be by turns soft hearted and doting then iron handed to his boys and we can see the same dichotomy in his approach to horse training we see that he doesn't want his young prospect racing horse overworked and hurt in small time races but he seems to be willing to risk the horse's life when he gets into the big time br br this is just one of matthau's wonderful performances and one that i highly recommend,1
1401,the world is going to miss john frankenheimer this was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but don't let that dissuade you from seeking it out frankenheimer's direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his cast br br someone else has already pointed them out but i also want to talk up james gregory and whit bissell in two key supporting roles both would work for frankenheimer again gregory most notably as the bumbling senator in the manchurian candidate and they do good work for him here br br if the whole thing seems too simple in the end that's merely because frankenheimer and writer robert chose to tell a simple story and they do it well keep a lookout for it turner classic movies just might show it again,1
1402,i have to admit i picked this movie just for the cast and while sutherland scacchi and prochnow were as usual great performers the rest of the movie was such a let down it feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts that is scripts lacking any depth awful photography and editing and hilariously lousy score i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot all the potential was there to make it a hit that is two main ingredients are there a great story of national conspiracies and a great core cast even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality but maybe i'm missing something until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion,0
1403,okay i'll say it this movie made me laugh so hard that it hurt this statement may offend some of you who may think that this movie is nothing more than a waste of film but the thing that most people don't get is that this movie was intended to be bad and cheezy i mean did people actually think that a movie about a killer snowman was intended to be a masterpiece just look at the scary hologram on the jacket of the movie and you'll find your answer instead like the original jack frost which i thought was just as funny this movie turned out to be a side splitting journey into the depths of corny dialogue bad one liners and horrible special effects and it's all made to deliver laughter to us viewers it certainly worked for me br br for example anne to her troubled husband what makes you frown so heavily darling br br if that chunk of dialogue doesn't make you laugh then you have serious issues who in their right mind would utter those words in real life of course no one because it was meant to sound ridiculous just take one viewing of this movie with an open mind and low expectations and hopefully you'll see what's so damn funny about jack frost 2,1
1404,i am rating this an 8 because of the premise of the film the acting was fine there wasn't anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children or choose to have none at all whereas dumb ass w in '04 supporters are procreating like rabbits and though i don't believe the earth will actually exist in 500 years i can see mike judge's parodied prophet coming to be as life imitating art the world is being run by idiots and it will get worse as the intelligent free thinking people become the minority and the git 'er done fans outnumber them the proof is our farce of an election br br but i digress if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city go see it i have paid my 7 50 plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone there are laughs there are cringes but overall this is entertaining if you have half a brain you will think to yourself how this movie though funny is spot on accurate and a tiny bit uncanny i'm not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown as fox was the one distributing this and they wouldn't want any of their sheep to see this and think maybe i will read a book and not watch or or my balls' if our society doesn't stop the dumbing down of everything and the of the english language ahem mr bush then this really is where we are going,1
1405,from what i understand mr bava abandoned this project before completion and rightfully so if i were him i definitely would have made sure that every copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film it never happened it never existed end of story br br despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film is it supposed to be scary not in the least is it supposed to be funny puh leese a total waste of time and i really don't like to have to say that,0
1406,before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille ball's life really was it had it's great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it,1
1407,other than john this movie was absolutely terrible the lacey chabert and andrew love story was as clichéd as possible full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super hammy longing looks none of the emotion had any depth or reality whatsoever the two accented characters dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert once they saw how bad the accents were couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches apparently not i don't even know where to start with the editing particularly the sound editing if you hate obvious over dubbing as much as i do don't watch this that being said was great off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this but he's quite entertaining as the off the wall friend with crazy ideas he's got a clichéd role but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible the ending was awful just flat out terrible the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential but floundering around after being shot all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert which looks nothing like her is the most cringe worthy scene,0
1408,i would suggest that only the valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that peck ever did daring surprising and one of his few best westerns no no of course not a western really but a military chronicle which sometimes is better it's quite but oh very original and striking it's one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets movies that no one yet told you they exist you sounds intriguing or it surpasses your expectations br br all in all the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the it somehow reminded me obliquely of it's also straight suspense br br peck looked dashing as a young and tough somewhat gloomy and stoic officer and there are many unexpected the blonde babe kissing and flirting with the one she's decided not to marry perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and retribution  br br even only  is so much more than a military is as well an action drama a suspense movie a commando action weirdest combo imaginable a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible attack  the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those natives could be only a handful of people  and this plot never takes a crap most would and did  the interest for humans for people and their reasons and actions never falters br br a due word about peck himself he performs with brio and though i usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring in such small outings i find intact all peck's somber and even chilling glamor he was an unusual star br br i gladly recommend this extraordinary movie,1
1409,as several posters have hinted this is a sorry star wars ripoff now if you're going to rip off star wars at least do it right battlestar galactica did and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it but this is definitely not one of them david mendenhall the juvenile lead actually isn't too bad though he goes overboard on the cute factor every so often vince edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his ben casey days if anything he's even more wooden than he was ten the other performances are nothing to write home about either even worse are the special effects the best you can say about them is that they're lousy it's glaringly obvious that the aliens are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them and the battle scenes between edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot a very weak effort from roger corman skip it,0
1410,this movie was produced by the biggest producer in costa although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in costa ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an oscar nomination due to it's political relevance with oil he he right well this is all a lie this movie was supposedly based on a book written by carlos salazar about a love triangle super cliché soap opera like subject and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the atlantic coast of costa with an american oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region but at the end it never was approved by the government now it may have some nice footage about the beaches but that's it nothing bigger than that it is all in the camera most of the actors are lousy except for two or three the rest lack of sense of what acting means they overact most of the time the story is completely common and cliché worthy of a cheap mexican soap opera as i said because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil but 80 of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle the script is nothing impressing it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought it has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes but besides that is pretty decent the director did an alright job i mean he is not like an oliver stone but he did his job with the resources he had handy i would like to question him why instead of using actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones i mean after all they about being an 100 production that's what you at least expect final the end is is not well done there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless besides being the most elaborated movie in all history i think it's mediocre you can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash never heard of pi anyway if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies this one will do but you are definitively not missing anything,0
1411,a unique blend of musical film noir and comedy with a few sex scenes thrown in for good measure the only other film i can think of with a fairly similarly wild and madcap mixture of themes and clichés is the french movie billy ze kick but that has a more surreal and quirky approach br br not that this film would not be surreal or quirky the humour is at times quite subtle at other times blatantly in your face and often crossing the border to offensiveness to give an example in the post coital chit chat with a prostitute our hero max encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder using the words los literally this phrase means shoot in german and that is exactly what a hidden assassin does in response in other words this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun br br is also one of the very rare examples of films with funny sex scenes larry's romance is accompanied by the song ich will i want more while the song perfectly underpins the action the meaning of its words changes a couple of times hinting at the end at larry's inability of providing any further service the film's main love scene between max and bettina kant lacks such subtlety this is jaw dropping stuff especially when singing slowly into moaning of course all in the rhythm of the music br br unmissable unless you are one of the easily offended,1
1412,about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are this is what 50 year old producers and out of touch hollywood script writers think stoner life is like as if they gave the cast of friends some pot bland dull annoying and completely unrealistic i despise this movie,0
1413,i like seeing linda blair playing in an actual horror movie again i had been disappointed with her in most everything since the exorcist movies which i loved what was up with all of those nasty b movies she did br br david on the other hand all i could do is laugh he is not cut out to be a horror movie actor david needs to stick to knight rider or baywatch br br all around this is an awesome movie even for the eighties this was an awesome film it has horror action and drama it is a suspenseful and i loved the way linda blair turned out,1
1414,when young frances 'baby' houseman goes to summer camp with her family she never expected to have so much fun one night after wandering away from a resort activity she stumbles upon a all night dance party with johnny castle and other fellow dancers quickly enthralled by the raunchy dance moves 'baby' is eager to learn when she has to fill in for penny just so she and johnny don't lose their jobs at the resort but young 'baby' soon finds herself in a sticky situation she has fallen in love with a man she knows her father will never approve of however when johnny is accused of stealing wallets it is up to 'baby' to confirm his alibi by admitting that she was with him the night they were taken johnny is fired anyway for getting involved with a visitor but quickly realises what a mistake it was leaving 'baby' he comes back with that famous line 'no one puts baby in a corner' and they show the resort exactly what they're made of br br an amazing film perfect for a girly night in with groovy tunes inspiring dances and a story that will make you feel all warm inside this has got to be the greatest film of all time,1
1415,i've seen this film so many times it's that good maybe because i can relate to way of life is the reason why not everyone would find it to their taste also my is improving after each viewing am i a sad case thankyou mr i look forward to your next film although i did not see the film at a cinema i have the dvd and would encourage anyone to buy it the special feature extras alone is worth the price the amount of time a director spends on the making of a film is very seldom appreciated the extras on the dvd gives an excellent insight to the making of a film as for the story of the film i'm bias i happen to rave about it to all my friends but as i said before i relate very much to the main character who is a loner in a situation not of his own choosing the mafia in sicily use to their money in a swiss bank he owes them for costing them millions of dollars years ago in stock market deal that went wrong love kills,1
1416,i had never heard of this movie but i like heath ledger and bryan brown and the story sounded interesting so i figured i'd give it a shot i found it to be very enjoyable heath ledger plays a 19 year old who works a kind of crappy job and wants to start making some serious dough so he goes and asks for work from mobster bryan brown i won't go into details but things go very bad for ledger and gets into big trouble with bryan brown from their on the movie just gets better and better with one scene involving ledger hooking up with a pair of bank robbers and lets not forget the beautiful rose byrne who plays ledger's love interest i would definitely recommend this movie,1
1417,shame to see an interesting story diluted into standard vietnam made for tv fare usually hbo movies are a substantial cut above tv bill paxton was a pretty good choice for the lead role but wasn't given much to work with,0
1418,sometimes a movie is so bad it's kind of good this movie was made in germany and is dubbed in english so you have to get past that the acting also was stilted and forced other than what was done by the real rats who imo did an excellent job of acting the part snaps to the rat wrangler anyway the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere this storyline has been used before not to mention has happened in real life too often unfortunately and the audience is not in for any surprises but this is fine we know what's going to happen and when and sometimes an audience needs a movie where a lot of brain cells are not necessary to follow along we have our hero down to the chiseled face and body the semi hero s and of course our heroine who happens to be the doctor but only still in training though it is she who discovers what really is going on when so many people end up sick and dying and not just from a rat bite of course the villain must die okay all the villains meaning the rats and the ending scene is one of those that reminds the audience that a sequel is in the works this is one of those movies that you just sit back and enjoy for what it is and what it is not,1
1419,dirty dancing one of my most favorite movies i've only watched it two times on abc because i haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from blockbuster i had no idea jennifer grey was 27 at the time she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager compared to some women in hollywood she has a very flat chest which is why i was fooled so easily about her age so both physically and emotionally grey pulls off playing a teen very well i also loved the dancing who wouldn't both times i've watched dirty dancing i keep wanting to look up dance classes i also love the soundtrack and i do recognize some of the songs from when i was eight or nine i would love to be able to watch this in my drama class and i'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes it's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year and the ending was absolutely fantastic that's one of the best moments in the film br br i can't believe i'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of dirty dancing who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title,1
1420,the whole world is falling prey to a lethal disease and rain never stops pouring down nevertheless in this atmosphere of nightmare a man and a woman discover that they are neighbors thanks to a hole in the floor of the man's apartment they fall in love at least all would not have been lost although this wonderful film expresses the loneliness and the weakness of human being there is also some room for hope in the shiny singing scenes,1
1421,five was an interesting viewing experience for me because of the question kieslowski seems to subtly ask the audience three men are the focus of this chapter and kieslowski present the two involved in murder with traits both good and bad in one's case almost overwhelmingly bad with such vile characters i found myself almost glad that they would receive some sort of punishment however when the time comes for the murder and it's subsequent effect on the murderer kieslowski takes an interesting angle and seems to ask those of us who shared my view are you not as guilty as this man this sort of indirect address of the audience makes the finale of five that much more profound as kieslowski as usual doesn't stay within the literal confines of his theme just as the other parts of the don't take their theme in it's literal sense neither does five it asks us what is murder who is more guilty of murder and what should be the appropriate punishment if any it's a fantastic film and typical of kieslowski absolutely stunning,1
1422,i'll put it straight to you this movie is dead boring it's about a flood that's it blah blah a little about family blah blah blah politics blah blah blah boring br br blame it all on the weatherman poor sod the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant a most irritating character br br if you are from the united kingdom or anywhere that it may flood then you might like this film it's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen br br this is not really an action film where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer or outrun it literally it is more like a time bomb that must be disabled br br looking at this movie it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated it isn't but for them it is br br really the movie is about as exciting as picking and i can't recommend it it's over 100 minutes far far too long br br the problems with the film i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such dissection hint to you buy more boats if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons,0
1423,this oscar winning short film 40 minutes based on a short story by william faulkner takes us back to small town tennessee in december 1941 two brothers one about 18 and one about 8 are looking for birds eggs obviously a huge collectors item for boys in the south around this time well the japanese bomb pearl harbor and the older brother pete decides to enlist he gives his prize egg to his little brother willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte well willie isn't having any of it if pete can be a soldier so can he he heads to memphis showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way after finding the enlistment center in memphis he demands to see his brother pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process we are shown the devotion and love of a little brother jonathan he delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear the movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one's youth as the two brothers reunite shortly the movie delivers a cathartic cry as the brotherly love envelops us all br br this movie is like a cold bottle of water maybe or good clear water with a flavorful mineral packet but not pure natural spring water like still it your thirst and you don't doubt its purity and effects it is more run of the mill and less expensive than some but gets the job done leaving one refreshed and afterwards 7 10,1
1424,this all looked quite promising an up and coming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors yet very few people have a good word to say about it br br the whole thing really needed some depth you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left wing with his ideas and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way rather than the way of the elected leader br br however the action scenes had a few logic holes the sewers and elevators already mentioned and the rather haphazard assassination method and linda hamilton's character is completely uninspired her 'the president's my father' was ludicrous that would make the president about 10 when that happened worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop br br they could have made a challenging inventive political thriller but either bottled it or failed they could've gone to town on special effects but the good ones were wasted they could have achieved so much more in general this was barely worth the £1 it cost me,0
1425,i enjoy science fiction just as much as the next man but what the hell was that apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film 1926 ' this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire produced on a budget that couldn't have been much more than zero in the year following a great war africa has become the most civilised region on earth and what was formerly europe has been designated unknown land an african explorer  played by johnny huggins a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man if you follow me  travels to the ruins of paris in his aircraft and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage catherine hessling then the director's wife and her primate companion perhaps the creepiest ape man costume i've ever seen the savage as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual starts showing the explorer the charleston dance which he is delighted to learn himself br br it doesn't help the film that hessling who was wonderful the following year in renoir's 'the little match girl 1928 ' isn't much of a dancer though the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony furthermore i'm quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object  it doesn't come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later on the plus side i did like the general sci fi concept behind the film and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this however why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time silly crude and quite pointless parade 1927 ' is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema's most respected directors and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack but i compromised with a selection of pieces from shostakovich,0
1426,this is without a doubt the most hilarious movie i've ever seen seriously if the makers of this movie are ever discovered they'll put guys like jim carrey out of a job rent jack o tonight believe me you won't regret it,0
1427,don't torture a duckling is one of the coolest italian horror films i've ever seen and i've seen my share to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery it's more of a straight horror movie br br complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old fulci's twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel the setting is perfect an old italian village the music is ridiculously perfect the finale is genuine and original br br after seeing don't torture a duckling you really have to wonder how fulci's later stuff got so off beat i like all his stuff but he strayed maybe he figured he already did it because with this film he hits the bullseye br br i'd recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre fulci beats him with this one br br 10 out of 10 kids,1
1428,i saw the film and am very pleased to see a film so different in character and story to the stupid mainstream american major productions its a film with a background interesting for young as much as all age groups contrary to certain reviews the audience seems to split my evaluation as the film is very successful wherever yet exploited worldwide for example in netherlands is was ranked number 3 negative statements must be respected but one should expect such to be guided on a fact basis if you have the chance view the film and enjoy it,1
1429,i was on a mission to watch uwe boll movies to see if they were really as bad as all that the first one i saw bloodrayne was not a complete loss i liked it more than most people and actually rated it a 4 out of 10 next up was the first house of the dead movie now that was horrifically bad i could stand watching ten minutes of it and fast forwarding a bit and that was it i could see where it was going and i didn't need to see any more of it in order to rate it a just 1 out of 10 br br but i had access to the sequel too which however is not by uwe boll but mysteriously written by the same guys who so incompetently wrote the first one and since it got a higher rating at imdb than the original i thought i'd give it a chance and i actually managed to watch all of it it started out with some funny references and cool lines like how the president got his orders from the vice president and acting wise it is light years better than the first here we have cool like the ultra hot emmanuelle vaugier whose coolness is in league with carrie anne moss claudia black and evangeline lilly man i hope some matrix style movie comes along for her sometime and the always delectable super victoria pratt i love athletic women and there was also nadine velazquez catalina on my name is earl who performed quite well br br the story wasn't much and the action wasn't great either and the ending was a disappointment as they didn't succeed in their mission oh well at least the two mains survived guess that's some small victory too br br good cast but a pretty bad movie the actors make it watchable but there's no real substance there br br 3 out of 10,0
1430,these guys are excellent and anything they put out to the public is first class the musicianship of this band is amazing and we should all be very thankful we live in a world where rush exists future generations will never be able to see such mastery live and in person get this dvd and you will enjoy it throughly i was recently able to see these incredible musicians play in houston tx and was blown away i have not missed a show since power windows and i have to say that they are better than ever everyone should embrace these guys and teach others what real musicianship is there will never be such a tight and well put together trio again in our lifetime lets just hope and pray that they do not retire anytime soon,1
1431,i can't believe i watched this whole movie another ishtar in that i kept waiting for it to get better which never happened the sound is terrible going from too low to hear the conversations to blaring sound in seconds the plot is absolutely implausible the acting is mediocre although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case although being typecast in that role could certainly be considered a negative the director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals medications science or anything of a technical nature sociopath i wonder how they came up with that diagnosis there are so many errors goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record as a general a motorcyclist on the freeway wearing a non dot off road helmet san francisco paper walls move when tapped helmets just appear out of thin air guns point one direction but hit things in another lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error my wife who is an rn in an unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting else it certainly would have gotten a 1,0
1432,this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by piotr known in the u s as dead man's bounty this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way my favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope a cowboy known only as 'the stranger' karel roden finds a dead man kilmer that he thinks is a wanted man he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff linda and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid he manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous 'wild goose one scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by with gunpowder and a match the corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john davidson nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck there is just something that tells you not to look but you do,0
1433,this movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés the writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic it a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters think of bugs bunny cartoons and silly supporting characters the lady doctor and the writer there are much better bogart films out there in fact bogart looks like he slept through this performance he puts very little effort into this character i think the directorial advice he received was something like he's a bad guy act bad this guy is the era's equivalent of darth vader obvious evil and the anti hero don't waste your time with this one,0
1434,unfortunately this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s which were pale imitations of the original the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg dragging frankenstein in mummy who exhibits no signs of intelligent life this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy 1932 you will be disappointed,0
1435,the war at home is so good it's become my new favourite show me and my carly and april watch this together every sunday and laugh at how true to life it is i love how everyone is so sarcastic and so worried and they dwell on every little issue once someone does something stupid they never live it down and that is soooo how family is the father always harps on all three kids about every little thing i love how the parents have no idea how to deal with the kids it's so true to real family life and the fact that the parents are so overwhelmed and have no clue how to solve their teenagers problems just puts the show over the top the war at home is so brutally honest and so true to the world we live in that it has become a milestone for sitcoms to come this isn't happy days or the brady bunch this is real life,1
1436,compared to the recent gore flick hostel which this movie reminded me a lot of i would say that see no evil is slightly better but not by much the very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence the kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins i guess the one thing i dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a wwe wrestler kane he ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one word lines in the movie there are a couple fairly gory moments mainly involving eye gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat probably the most effective demise in the movie br br i can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great can't recommend it,0
1437,hard to get in depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it let alone expressing an opinion on it i don't know anything about this watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts apparently it's an unofficial sequel to 1982's slumber party massacre which i did enjoy as a fun slasher cheerleader massacre looks like a late nite soft core cinemax porno and not surprisingly chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips prolific t a actresses are in this plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else a group of 20 something high school cheerleaders two random guys and the fat stupid comic relief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night the recently escaped slumber party killer is in the area and begins killing them off there's no gore or originality and i wouldn't say the nudity is a real selling point since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be absolutely terrible,0
1438,right the hospital scene with holly and shannon was done brilliantly it starts off with piper on a gurney looking very badly injured the docs race her into a resuscitation room they move her from the gurney onto a bed and holds her hand from that point on it is obvious that piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and her lungs are failing as she turns to beg of to not leave her side she gaps don't go i love you and then her pulse drops and she goes into cardiac arrest the monitor shows a clear flat line the nurses go into full out trauma mode bring in a steps back from the bed in horror as the doctors desperately try to shock her dying sisters heart but there is no response and she is tragically pronounced dead well great scene well done girls,1
1439,mankind's self awakening is the theme of 2001 a space odyssey a process that unfolds along a space time continuum we see our primordial past and we infer a cosmic future the powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception in our ongoing collective journey br br from this transcendental perspective a conventional egocentric plot seems superfluous our frenzied conflicts and self important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension it's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story for perceptive viewers the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe br br in this film which is mostly visual geometric symbols guide our intuition circles and arcs represent nature right angles represent conscious intelligence some people think the sleek black monolith is a von neumann probe maybe without doubt the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown mystery is more profound than explanation br br 2001 is unique among films in content and scope the cinematography is out of this world the special and visual effects are breathtaking and the classical music is sublime i rarely use the word masterpiece to describe a movie but stanley kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey is art in the highest sense like leonardo da mona lisa or vincent van gogh's the starry night,1
1440,br br this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are blended well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight anti climax in terms of action quality and astonishing of the scenes preceding it the humor doesn't seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other hongkong movies and this film is of totally other class than most american action comedies of recent years lau ching wan acts as a typical intuitive police hero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors the dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns leaving plenty of corpses in it's wake yu is especially impressive as an ultra cool merciless gangster in this woo like piece of action where tough guys are truly die hard,1
1441,the film is one of the best horror films i have ever seen overall i'm not a big fan of horror films but there is something about this film that is more atmospheric and different from any other horror film i have ever seen many horror films i've seen i've enjoyed watching however as they are based on horror i know that the stories are unreal as they are fictional therefore i can't take them all seriously on the other hand is a unique horror genre as it has a feel of realism that i've seen in very few other horror films br br this films story on how a man gets murdered and ends up living with the undead in an underground cemetery shelter with undead monsters is the kind of story a person would get from a dreaming nightmare as its a very unique and original storyline most horror films i've seen are all quite fake but because was so incredibly sophisticated and directed with superb acting especially by craig sheffer aaron boone amazing special effects great lighting and fantastic dialogue i found this film to have a sense of depth and maturity with no silly fake horror parody whatsoever that many other horror films have as well as being horror has elements of thriller romance and action all rapped in one if you haven't seen this film i recommend you watch it as i rate it a 10 10,1
1442,this movie was marketed extremely well when it was released in '97 during the middle of master fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves that's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250 000 copies and still goin' br br if you are a fan of no limit back then or even now check it out it has a few old school videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus ice cream party so what i got to say to all the people who don't like master p or no limit records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes,1
1443,this is not a movie this is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world dubbed over with some random text the footage is not that great and the text is not that great either the end product is excruciatingly dull br br on the dvd turning the commentary on can provide some entertainment value as the director makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci fi movie it's also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage too bad it's rubbish but i think the making of fata morgana would be a fascinating film sort of like 'ed wood was,0
1444,if you've ever seen open water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film i liked the action suspense the slow building of it all i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to open water with that sequel but anyways the one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time film starts out pretty much like it should kids packing up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure curiously enough the first day they spent at guess hmm a crocodile farm so they are out there and all is good for a little while then bang crocodile time very intense you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile a whole heck of a lot but when you do gosh it is very scary i love the croc's snout and eyes and the shroud of fog that seems to the croc every time he raises his head above the water very very creepy but good overall this is a great film if you can get past the annoying little sister,1
1445,this movie is astonishingly poor it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue waiting for leslie nielsen to appear it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy it was meant to be taken seriously what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie and worse still other people funded it and gave it the green light br br rutger hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay br br strangely this film is so poor that you find yourself staring at it wondering how it actually got funded and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas speak spell br br the hollywood money machine at it's worst funny though,0
1446,in russia in being invaded by two sides from the orient by the mongols and from europe side by the germans teutonic knights of the holy roman empire the city of is the last free city in russia the population in order to organize the defense of and the lands of russia calls the prince aleksandr nevsky who had defeated the swedish in a previous battle his successful strategy defeats the germans after a great battle on a frozen lake this movie was made in 1938 due to the threaten of the german to russia in a pre second world war period the idea was to make propaganda pro russia however it is an overwhelming marvelous stunning powerful masterpiece it is amazing the combat scene on the frozen lake the present generation is very accustomed to special effects like in the lord of the rings' trilogy and maybe cannot understand how fantastic is this black and white fight if the viewer can forget the ideology and watch it as an art he will certainly be astonished in the end with such a masterpiece my vote is ten br br title brazil alexander nevsky,1
1447,sarah plain and winters end was the best movie i have ever seen the person in the story that i liked best had to be cassie played by emily osment just because of her energy and how she speaks her mind for example when anna calls from town cassie wants to answer and she says hello anna guess what grand father was lost but hes back now and he is not a good man i loved all of the sarah plain and tall movies for my rating i think sarah plain and tall was 3 was 2 winters end was 1 if i could live in any family from the past it would have to be the family i think there are so many good parts in this movie i can't name all of them i think they picked the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the movie so if you ever want to watch a movie from the past i would highly highly highly recommend sarah plain and winters end,1
1448,i saw this series on pbs in 1980 in college and i still can't get it out of my head although i have never seen it since i remember every cast member the casting was perfect as mentioned in other comments the design the lighting and of course the story which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set probably the best tv series i ever saw next to the original roots,1
1449,i've seen 'nurse betty' twice in september 2000 on the international film festival 'films by the sea' in vlissingen the netherlands it impressed me so much that i kept on smiling the whole day after i watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when i took the movie as the final taste of the festival what i knew about 'nurse betty' was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soap opera star but what i saw was much more than that splendid roles for morgan freeman chris rock renée zellweger a strange mix of romance violence and roadmovie and for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think you're on the track many soap opera lovers will love 'nurse betty' the movie as well as the character but they can bring all there non soap friends 'cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines freeman and rock for the cruel scenes the thriller aspects and for the beautiful pictures and i'm quite sure that at the end everyone will love 'nurse betty' for her captivating and innocent charm,1
1450,after 30 years of hiatus once again i immerse myself in the mist of uplifting melancholy the cold slow paced and existential treatment of this crime story comes from a different world melville's world where darkness is pure enlightenment,1
1451,lana turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister joan blondell makes for her br br when both sisters come to new york they follow blondell's beau a wonderful george murphy in this film br br as fate would have it the director of the show is impressed with turner but sees nothing ahead for blondell except a job as the cigarette girl not only does blondell miss stardom boyfriend murphy eddie falls for turner as well so as not to hurt her sister turner is ready to marry the producer of the show a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times br br the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to nebraska look for paul ford as a gossip columnist in the film he is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner the film leaves you with the question of whether ford and blondell could ever get together br br blondell as the devoted sister sacrifices both career and love for her sister this film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in technicolor br br few realize that george murphy the future republican senator from california was quite a song and dance man in his day,1
1452,this is the funniest sequel i have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary it has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick in this one he has a female doll companion hence the name if you liked the first three then you'll love this go watch it,1
1453,the last of the airport sequels this has alain delon and george kennedy who was in all the airport movies as pilots david warner as the radio engineer susan blakely as a newswoman targeted for death robert wagner as a brilliant scientist stop laughing eddie albert as a president of the airlines charo in a dreadful comical bit john davidson as a newsman love how his hair stays in place even after the plane turns upside down poor martha raye is humiliated cicely tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying son stop rolling your eyes jimmie walker as a clarinet player what did i say about not laughing mercedes as a russian gymnastics coach ok you can laugh at that one bibi as a hooker and sylvia kristel and sybil danning as love interests br br just pathetic full of stupid plots and dialogue that will have you roaring watch for davidson getting married on the plane near the end the concorde is taking all these people to russia they're attacked with missiles escape land safely in france and take off again the very next day don't you think the flight would have been cancelled or something most of the acting is terrible is a sight to behold in a red fright wig and a horrible fake accent the only good acting is from kennedy and delon looking fantastic who gives a very engaging performance still that's not enough to make you sit through this drivel too long and lousy special effects too this was a mega bomb and thankfully stopped universal from doing anymore,0
1454,the 1998 version of psycho needed to be set back in the 60's rather than present day the headliners would have done a good job with the setting there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane anne heche was sitting at her desk her boss took his client into his office because it was air conditioning i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning the other was the meeting of lila crane julianne moore sam loomis viggo mortensen lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater,0
1455,let's see how many ways you can insult my gender 1 of course girl 1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds looks like a heroin addict br br 2 of course girl 1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted br br 3 of course the lesbians are butch germans who are into s m br br 4 this one was actually a surprise ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy br br 5 director's commentary talking about hooking up with actresses in the movie just so you know is crass and incredibly unprofessional,0
1456,i have watched this movie quite bemused i am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a rob zombie type affair or an exploration of real events br br in either case it missed its mark it's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story br br the performances were neither compelling nor bad br br for me i would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect,0
1457,i loved this movie and i never knew it was this old it came out the day n year i was born in and now i am 19 now i still love this movie especially the songs like my mother and boys and girls of rock n roll and i remember as a kid i believe i was 5 n my sister was 6 and my cousin boy was 6 as well we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie i was and janette and my sister was and my cousin was alvin simon and theodore those were good times and i miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so am i and my sis we are not going to forget about the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie i still even remember the songs and the words off by heart even though i haven't seen this movie for 12 years but now starting to love it again alvin and the chipmunks and 3 3 3 3,1
1458,the mountainous woods young happy campers a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure the ingredients are there for a horror delight and director co writer jeff does an adequate job at achieving it it's formulaic woodland horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a trimmed sense is effectively told in certain realism maybe a little more exposition wouldn't have gone astray but craftsmanship makes up for the material's flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad very ominously lingering score whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop cinematographers dean m and joel king do a striking job too there's plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the build up is slow grinding at times the pacing can become a stop and go affair it's not particularly violent but there's still a mean streak evident even if some of it happens of screen the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn there's a likable bunch of performances deborah benson makes for a strong dashing heroine gregg henry chris lemmon ralph seymour jamie rose mike and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries the final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking is that it br br a well etched backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm,1
1459,take an utterly stupid story couple it with unprofessional performances 2 bit graphics add ultra lame comedy bits and you get this film i thought the original was bad but at least that story was simple and straightforward though idiotic may nobody produce another in this series,0
1460,loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly i'll be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed,1
1461,all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating you almost want them to be rubbed out br br the parents in this clan aren't so bad but their two little boys one a total brat one cloyingly cutesy poo are insufferable while their older good for nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt but the granddaddy of them all is well granddaddy as played by chic sale in full mode he serves as the films moral compass throwing in lots of diatribes about dang dirty foreigners for good measure if these are the good guys it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars br br not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating family the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further only walter huston as the district attorney elevates the cliché riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts br br the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing the witness formula and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard bitten underworld lifestyle but there are quite simply better and less xenophobic examples in the genre,0
1462,maybe i was to young when i saw it perhaps i have not grown up with grease and elvis movies br br i failed to get it i get black comedy black adder etc i get irony and spoofs i don't get this one though br br i made it a quest to find out the name of this movie enlisting the help of people on usenet and the most excellent imdb message boards so it could be my first 1 pointer awful,0
1463,i had no idea this movie was produced by wwe wrestling is lame enough why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was i found it to be a complete disappointment if i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was i would have stayed home and done something more entertaining sure i'll give them the credit of the cool effects but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been he lacked a number of things but i'll let you point them out for yourselves the plot was a great idea just could have been done in a much better way maybe in the future wwe will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry,0
1464,morte a venezia is one of my favorite movies more than beautiful it's really sublime it gives you important aesthetic experiences it's a masterpiece i also recommend the novel luchino visconti is a genius,1
1465,i am a talent manager i have been for 15 years now i have discovered some wonderful talent they have been in movies commericals and television in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful i love seeing the ability of real people not just a name the actors in this movie were very natural and believable i was very entertained by this film i love a movie with a few twists i also enjoy when at the end of the movie the puzzle is solved i still would like to know what happened to the large sum of the money when you see the flick you will understand what i am saying the mobsters all look real i would like to see this film on the big screen the footage was shot really well the scenery of new york was the new york that i know have a happy 2006 and may this movie make it to the awards,1
1466,'the english patient' can rightly be compared to the films of david lean whose sweeping epics such as 'lawrence of arabia' and 'bridge on the river must have inspired the director anthony the film is beautifully photographed and like is set in northern africa but during the second world war the story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ralph fiennes and a married woman played by kristin scott thomas br br the story based on a novel by michael is told in flashbacks by fiennes' count de the titular character the fact that his name does not sound like he's english plays a key role in what unfolds he has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in europe by hana an army nurse played by juliette binoche what makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill fated lovers the film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for if you're a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that 'the english patient' speaks directly to you br br,1
1467,martin first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer three years later to elia kazan's more conservative on the waterfront while waterfront benefited immensely from an electrifying marlon brando who inadvertently disguised kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names as kazan did eagerly before the house un american activities committee edge of the city boasts a young john cassavetes and an upstart sidney poitier daring to confront issues that waterfront failed to acknowledge namely workers' rights and race relations br br edge of the city boldly dives into this then unknown territory and although the quite appealing black protagonist poitier may seem a bit hollywood simplistic the courageous struggle against thinly veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all one wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white black relations if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early they must of left dumbfounded if not offended br br the last reel of the film will still surprise audiences as it refuses to sink into expected clichés including those that tainted waterfront only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film edge of the city ends up being br br what's most disturbing about this lost classic how it sadly remains unavailable on any format for reasons that remain quite cloudy this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country yet one can only find it on obscure late night tv if ever at all,1
1468,mild spoilers br br this movie was filthy and stupid it could have done well without the constant humping and nude sex it was also very profane i think that they had a good story developing but they messed up the whole thing by overdoing it,0
1469,the above profile was written by me when i used the nick of which is still my email address i still believe andy devine's character of frisky is the best twilight episodes ever and i watch this episode at least once a year as i consider to be a fortunate man as he has many friends who love him dearly br br in case many of you are too young to remember i'm 61 andy devine hosted a children's entertainment show in the 50's i believe called andy's gang on it he had three assistants a cat named midnight who played the violin a mouse named squeaky who played an a hand organ and a devilish toad named who's could appear and disappear at will embarrassing many of andy's funny guest stars like billy gilbert,1
1470,if there's one theme of this film it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination this family is poor their father works graveyard and their mother works double shifts and peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl he is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change and thinks like your appearance start to matter the backdrop of this story is the 1967 world's fair and the centennial of canada the film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope watch the flim and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with and then for some reason lost you'll really like this film perhaps kids will like this film but only adults will truly appreciate it including its references to and what parent's will do for their children,1
1471,the is probably slim pickens best performance of all time when we were shooting everyone connected with the production figured that slim was academy award material unfortunately united artists had a james bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to the i personally feel this film was under rated by most critics sam junior bonner was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film also cliff robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us too the picture is worth watching if just for the rodeo footage some of the best ever filmed shot by james crabbe the director and my co writer steve died a few weeks after the picture's release cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife sally his daughter gaby and newborn son stefan please give this movie a shot i'm betting that you'll say it was well worth while i thank anyone who has taken the time to read this stephen lodge,1
1472,this is one of the best bloke movies from the early 90's and whilst slightly dated its one of those movies that would never get made today which makes it very special in fact a very similar movie was made in the 90's called masterminds and it was a pg variation on the same theme but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic for that matter br br so what's so special about this film it's the between the main characters and the against all odds theme of the film sean astin is very likable and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80 90's particularly the goonies he also went onto greater things with rudy and the lord of the rings trilogy but encino man is a good trip down memory lane will wheaton from stand by me lends nice support to the film and andrew divoff is a terrific villain louis gossett jr sleepwalks in his role but he does add some brevity to the film particularly his relationship with astin's rebellious nature br br so how's the action by today's standards it's rather tedious and cheap looking almost like a tv movie but the production values are good and the violence is actually quite nasty for a film involving school students however the director makes up for the limited budget with some nicely suspenseful moments and well placed humor br br so park your brain at the door and enjoy this fondly remembered action flick but don't expect oscar material,1
1473,this film did entertain me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving along in all types of crazy directions if you like suggestive language and sexy looking gals they were all in the picture and gals and guys all looking burned out before they even graduate from high school there is one scene where the teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it out into a lake or ocean which is repeated over and over again there is no horror to this film except the word horrible for the entire picture and arnold who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character please don't waste your time viewing this film,0
1474,for starters i once met the director when he was going to ww2 re enactments with a period movie camera and making videos of the events which looked darned good i really wish he'd kept that up because as much as i applaud what he accomplished on a clearly next to nothing budget when i popped out the dvd i just wondered why i sat through almost two hours of nothing there's no real plot to speak of you don't really care what happens to the characters maybe the italian troops and some of the germans and the ending is yet another art film commentary on the futility of war i could have told someone how it would end once i got through the first ten minutes i knew the germans would have a few heroically volunteer to fight to the death i knew most of the gis would be killed it was just too darned obvious and while i'm on the subject i was shocked to see so much of the axis side done well yet the gi side done comically all the character development was clearly for non english speaking roles the gis simply got shafted hard in this film and i can't help but wonder if they even had someone on the set who understood how the us army works the phrases terminology actions were clearly written by someone with no knowledge of the american military at all had i now known who had directed this film i'd have sworn it was directed and written by a german,0
1475,wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released wait a year then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination br br i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten star production has to be doing it to skew the data anything above 8 would be odd br br nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her hair for the short time she was featured though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern virginia nc accent did sneak through ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film br br the dvd i rented had two bonus features a mini bio section that only featured sandra's bio taken verbatim from imdb it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus 3 questions hope you get them all right,0
1476,herman has made northern drama his own with little voice and brassed off but the formula falters in this ropey flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see newcastle br br underage smoking and drinking underage sex teenage abortion school bullying drug abuse substance abuse depression child violence child sex abuse shoplifting auto theft violent assault and armed robbery all put in an appearance here none of these issues are explored they merely serve to move the story along from one implausible situation to another the film is not as acutely observed as trainspotting as poignant as the full monty or as reflective of the times as wonderland from which it shamelessly steals music in an overly manipulative manner i suspect none of the filmmakers are from newcastle and have certainly never experienced the social problems the film references i am all for entertainment and herman's track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears quite simply he comes up incredibly short here br br the film has a nice ending but there are far too many flat banal moments to sit through to get there nicely shot not very well acted and ultimately fails on three crucial points script script script,0
1477,i can remember seeing this movie when i was very young and several times on tv since then i have always liked it i have noticed on the print shown on local tv that one scene has reversed film it is the one where they are hiding behind the rock outcrop it looks like vasquez rocks near los angeles watching the indians ride by if you look carefully you will notice that suddenly all the soldiers are left handed it is only a short segment and i have to admit that it took me years to notice it br br as far as history goes there were often to rescue white captives from the indians the direct connection for the final battle scene is the battle of island in that action a group of volunteer scouts equipped with repeating carbines spencer carbines not were surprised by the indians and retreated to an island and held off several charges in the last charge they killed roman nose one of the more famous indian chiefs i have no idea if the writer of the script had this in mind but it does fit fairly well br br there are several guy madison movies that i hope come out on dvd someday and this is one of them,1
1478,this movie was terrible it is not something that people should have to pay to see it looks like some christian group made it to convert people i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv br br it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci fi film from the 50s but quickly changed about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about god and do you believe in jesus it quickly moves into pure religion territory br br i thought i was going to a sci fi movie the film has poor acting bad camera angles and is amateurish br br avoid it,0
1479,this two character drama is extremely well acted and has a valid message and some truly shocking moments shocking not because they are graphic but because you're not prepared for them when they come but eventually it does become oppressive just like the somewhat similar a pure formality did still alan rickman should have gotten an oscar nomination for his multi dimensional performance no doubt about it 1 2,1
1480,i don't think this cartoon was as bad as some may think of course i was only five at the time it came out but i did find it very entertaining at the time and would still give it a look today if given the opportunity batman and robin being voiced by adam west and burt ward was a nice touch and gave it a sense of familiarity for me as i was also watching re runs of the campy 1960's live action show batman at that age this cartoon also introduced some new twists i had forgotten all about like bat mite for instance looking back on it i'm sure he was likely as annoying as many think but he didn't bother me much at the time the best i can recall his voice sounded like a cross between dumb donald and gee i wonder why anyway give it a look if you can and make up your own mind you might be surprised,1
1481,the gymnast unfolds in short shots and short scenes revealing its characters and message over time the spare editing is accompanied by a beautiful simple score this intimate approach is wonderful for feeling like you're on a path of discovery as much as the characters are br br the spare approach is also its drawback there are a few scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context there are some decisions made by the characters that seemed rather flip until i watched the interviews that were in the bonus materials i'm glad i did because the actors' descriptions of their motivations gave me a much more well rounded understanding of the film overall br br aside from the story itself it was wonderful to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies the shooting was very tastefully done very matter of fact one has the feeling of seeing a love story and a life story unfold not a voyeuristic sleaze film the physicality of the athletes their realness is a great contrast to the sometimes ethereal nature of the plot br br not a film i'll need to see again anytime soon since the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time,1
1482,as other posters have commented this was a very very bad movie keeping it kid friendly fx was low class they should of spent the 1 on a coke as is typical with these d movies most victims die and leave a mystery except for one lucky soul and of course the lead hope the money was worth it for really really big step down from babylon 5 nice to see what happened to buck rogers but damn this was low even for him ' it was so bad and on the older actors you could even seem to tell that they thought it was bad also don't watch br br warning spoiler below br br this thing chased down everyone it was after and yet boxlietner got away that was pure bs and the ending how in the hell did the kids end up right there with him that was just too much stupidity,0

1484,this film stinks more than limburger cheese if you find this at a garage sale leave it there i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie although ashamed i do own a copy and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all they play it up to be a sandra bullock movie she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that but she is young and had not learned her talent yet well everyone has to start somewhere,0
1485,my god how bad this is who is this impostor pretending to be ali g avoid this at all costs it replaces the smart multi layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour br br this was obviously an attempt to get him known in the states before he released his show there on hbo br br one commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums while it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen mr sacha baron cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline instead we have this mess which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with ali g except for the packaging br br terribly disappointing go seek out the dvd's of innit or bling bling for some real ali g,0
1486,in moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win i loved how the maple leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for bobby and tessa the acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry br br great editing at the end of the short i felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece br br excuse me while i rinse off the cheese whiz but i guess it's acceptable at certain times br br two scenes which i must point out are the bath tub and the couch scene br br the couch scene for tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition throughout the short i viewed her as a brute but now we see her true reality her mind spoke before her heart need i say more about the bath tub scene,1

1491,i saw this as a kid before it had been yanked from the rotation and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth there were some competently worked out gags but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who'd been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless br br moe himself might have wanted this one buried he was a liberal guy in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close moe stepped into the street to show it wasn't a problem and the man then got back on the curb then off again finally the man told moe nervously that if moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him he might get them both lynched br br another thing there are exploding ostrich eggs but no in the film so the title should actually be if anyone cares the on me,0

1493,i was excited to see this show when i started seeing the promos on a e i've been fascinated with ghosts and the paranormal since i was a kid and love catching ghost hunters when it's on scifi channel i've tried to watch three episodes of paranormal state and only use up my time commenting on it because it's so bad and perpetuates the notion that anyone who believes in the paranormal is a gullible freak paranormal state is beyond cheesy cheesy director's log voice overs that will leave you wishing for captain kirk cheesy teasers going into commercial breaks that are taken completely out of context everything paranormal on this show is automatically assumed to be evil and the work of a demonic spirit then come the psychics like in poltergeist you almost expect the team to leave and say this house is clear i very much appreciate the ghost hunters approach where they go in to disprove claims then take away what they can and they are almost always reassuring to the client if they find anything that haunted does not equal evil paranormal state is not so bad it's good it's just plain bad didn't a e used to stand for arts entertainment the art part has long been gone and the entertainment factor is now waning as well,0
1494,it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days especially for television considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes not to mention lesbianism this has been given superb treatment and direction br br the sets and costumes are flawless the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes the protagonist is really a tragic figure but not devoid of happiness also this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality lesbianism the characters are very human it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay not so with this in tipping the velvet the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means br br the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts,1
1495,the film disappointed me for many reasons first of all the depiction of a future which seemed at first realistic to me was well built but did only feature a marginal role then the story itself was a weak copy of lost in translation the middle eastern setting man with family meets new girl overseas karaoke bar the camera movements and the imagery all that was a very bad imitation of the excellent lost in translation which had also credibility this movie tries to be something brilliant and cultural it is not i wonder why tim robbins even considered doing this film the female main actress is awful did she play the in minority report and why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this lost in translation didn't have to show excessive love scenes r rated just for this this movie isn't even worth watching it from a videostore,0
1496,this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael short film extinct from 1995 while michael idea was original and perfect for a short film setting a sound of plot was poorly adapted from story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case for a studio to release such a product it is a shame especially for warner brothers a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993 on television visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture in cases like this sad as it may be can the film,0
1497,wow in my opinion the net is an excellent nail biting edge of your seat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over when i first saw it i was feeling good all over for days when angela sandra bullock went to mexico i thought to myself that is a really nice place to vacation from the moment jack northam and ruth wendy gazelle began chasing her i thought to myself don't let anything bad happen to her please i also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than i already had on the bright side if you ask me the house was very luxurious and spacious in conclusion i give this excellent nail biting edge of your seat techno thriller four stars,1
1498,the game of hockey i play and watch has something called speed which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing add to that a storyline that is cliché predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have youngblood oh keanu as a french canadian yeah whatever gimme and the anytime one out of ten,0
1499,i was able to see a preview of this movie through pre screening program and let me tell you this movie is unbelievably good i have seen many movies but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one i had a decent respect for tenacious d before seeing the movie and now i am mad about them i will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again br br if you were on the fence about seeing this movie get off and go see it it is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing br br aside from the comedy the glorious and divine music that flows from guitar and voice is awe inspiring the audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous and hilarious lyrics if for nothing other than the music itself this movie is worth the price of admission br br with a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional d history and hallmarks great new songs hilarious comedy and some pretty awesome cameos this movie ranks up there with the best go see it,1
1500,it's about time for a female boxing flick but this one ain't it though the acting isn't too bad the predictable storyline and silly dialogue pretty much ruin this one from the get go to top it off the boxing scenes display zero tension come on how hard is it to make a boxing match seem exciting,0
1501,edge vs michaels boring in general loved the sweet chin music into the chair 4 10 taker vs one of the worst matches i've seen predictable as hell 1 10 tripe threat wwe match why do i watch them nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble its not the main event liked it when show drove jbl through the wall 3 10 world heavyweight championship pretty ok match kind of more a beat down by tripe h than a match but i was happy to see it after watching crap 5 10 royal rumble good rumble liked the brand showdown the hassan thing and the end 7 10 overall still crap why does anyone watch the rumble,0
1502,wealthy businessman bill compton played by dennis patrick accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument panic stricken he retreats to a bar and meets joe played by peter boyle a loud mouth angry bigot who is bitter over how his beloved country has become unintentionally bill allows joe to find out that he just killed a hippie and this is only the beginning joe is a classic film of an unlikely friendship a bond between two men one of a white collar background the other of a blue collar background bill joe have one thing in common they are disgraced over how crazy the world has become dennis patrick peter boyle have both given very realistic portrayals of their characters director john g with this pre rocky effort directs this low budget gem with the same finesse as a movie with a 100 million budget the script is loaded with excellent character development and very snappy realistic dialog in spite of its strengths this film does have its weaknesses the script falls asleep roughly 3 4 of the way through but it wakes up just in time for the jarring climax this film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24 year old susan sarandon as bill's daughter melissa along with her hippie boyfriend frank portrayed very blandly by patrick mc dermott one could only be thankful that he was killed off early in the film in spite of its few flaws this is one of those forgotten films of the 70's that should not be even though joe is very dated to today's standards the chemistry between dennis patrick peter boyle is completely relevant today and it is the glue that holds the whole film together,1
1503,it's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable for those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe simply because predator island contains none of this it is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades now i appreciate bad horror films they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances however if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the cult hall of fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination creativity plus get some talent oh and a few extra bucks to put into your picture br br one horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore however shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds to really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters some identifiable traits i know you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers he's just stating an amateur remark well that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are br br despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie there was a silver lining the performance by dan gordon as chris is splendid he is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting he not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle that being the rest of the cast dan gordon is going to be a star hopefully sooner than later that is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back,0
1504,the most impressive thing about cinema' is its title an anagram which is very nearly also a unfortunately it only works in american english since in britain is spelt differently br br i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes br br back in the early 1960s the second season of 'the twilight zone' opened each episode with a shot of revolving concentric circles in black and white there's an image in cinema' which is so similar i wonder if 'twilight zone' borrowed it from this film the main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral indeed if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral this one is it throughout cinema' we're treated to shots of a revolving disc containing words in french moving in a spiral the effect is vertiginous and the texts about incest and eskimos are nearly dada in their meaninglessness i did laugh at one clever sexual pun br br the emperor is naked folks and this movie just barely rates 2 points out of 10 au,0
1505,the only people i would recommend this film to are both blind and deaf although i'm sure a would get a kick out of it this film had nothing no acting terrible music awful script only the power to suck any happiness from your soul you may be wondering by now why or even how i managed to sit through the full hour and a half of sheer inanity and it is honestly a difficult concept for even myself firstly i had to pace up and down as the film progressed as i found it extremely hard to get comfortable secondly i only made it without gnawing off my own arm in order to have something to beat myself to death with by phoning friends for moral support when the plot became particularly slow the problem was it became a matter of pride for me to finish it after the opening thirty minutes and that was a fatal error on my behalf i normally like films to leave you with something by the end but all this did was take for the sake of your sanity do not watch this film,0
1506,the kid at 39 years old russel has a life that most men would envy he has a great job is respected and feared has a beautiful house and makes buckets of money but everything comes at a cost in this case no social life no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone he just needs someone to show him the way br br as i watched the movie i kept wondering why disney didn't pass this film on to miramax not because it's particularly daring or edgy but because it is clearly a movie for adults this is exacerbated by the marketing campaign which is clearly targeting children it is lumped in with trailers for rugrats the movie and pokemon 2000 aren't they passe yet but i quibble br br i was impressed by the sensitive treatment of the subject matter rather than the typical male midlife crisis that involves some pathetic sap buying a porsche convertible and acting like a moron willis' character undertakes some serious introspection and takes stock of his life his guide on this journey of self discovery is himself at age 8 they never explain how rusty arrives and frankly i didn't care young innocence and unbridled optimism give him a distinct advantage in the truth he sums up russell's job as an image consultant thusly you teach people how to lie and pretend to be something they aren't in order for a good script to succeed however you need actors to bring it to life not a problem here br br although willis has thrice ignored w c fields' warnings about starring with children or animals he has lucked out once again meshing as well comedically with breslin as he did dramatically with osment willis manages to balance russell's cutthroat traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous breslin meanwhile gives a dead on portrayal of a kid from everyone's childhood the one that always stuck out for some reason and got picked on we also get two bonus performances lily tomlin is great as russell's levelheaded assistant and jean smart is perfect as an insightful charming anchorwoman i loved her in guinevere br br the kid is charming heavy and real and it will appeal to adults of all ages,1
1507,this small john ford western with no 'stars' but a cast of character actors is one of his masterpieces it has a documentary like feel to it as it traces the journey west of a party of mormons and it may be the most authentic looking of all ford's films it's on par with the sun shines bright which he made a couple of years later br br there is a plot of sorts a group of bank robbers join the wagon train at one point but the film's dramatic highlights are almost incidental the splendid performances of ford's stock company ben johnson harry carey jr ward bond jane darwell etc adds considerably to the film's authenticity while the nearest the film gets to a full bodied star performance is joanne dru's denver dru was a much finer actress than she was ever given credit for as were bond and johnson who at least was finally awarded with the recognition of an oscar for his work in the last picture show as he said himself 'it couldn't have happened to a nicer add bert superb location photography and you have a genuine piece of americana that couldn't have some from anyone other than ford this is a film that truly honors america's pioneers and is full of sentiment and feeling,1
1508,i just watched this movie on bravo and it was absolutely horrible it has the plot of a shannon tweed movie without the nudity the premise was interesting enough a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money the characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed br br for a movie called class warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending this movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a who done it br br the acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script lindsey is very cute and i'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script she's probably the only reason why i sat through the whole movie br br,0
1509,in 1989 aardman animations introduced the two heros in the grand day out in 1993 they fought an evil penguin in the wrong trousers and in 1995 they had to rescue sheep from an evil robot dog in a close shave in 2005 they're back and they are going to fight something that used to be cute and in the curse of the were rabbit in this full feature film wallace and gromit work in a pest control business there's going to be a giant vegetable competition but rabbits keep eating the neighbors wallace and gromit takes care with that problem but wallace had an idea he will brainwash the bunnies with his machine after doing that something suddenly eats all of the in the neighborhood and it's big it's up to wallace and gromit to save the day as a fan of these two characters i was impressed it kept what the 3 previous chapters had and instead adding a lot of hollywood actors for voice overs they put a no name cast to the job and boy they did a fantastic job wallace and gromit has not changed wallace is still the cheese loving freak like he always was and gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog also the script was not too shabby like other family movies were there is a twist of who the were rabbit really is the direction from nick park the director of the 3 previous chapters does a really good job with the storyline instead of adding the hollywood formula in it he just took the style of the previous chapters and adds a bit of a dark fantasy twist in it well done nick the rabbits are also funny and adorable but the funniest rabbit in the movie is one who has the mix of wallace in him the characters were not bad and they weren't annoying but they'll never top wallace and gromit the animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful i've never seen a clay animated movie that is so amazing since chicken run overall fans of the two knuckleheads including the teens will love this fantastic film it is a well done film that should get an oscar next year hooray wallace and gromit 10 10,1
1510,i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re runs i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate the first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of history repeating itself jr having a kid like his parents did the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone ex katie and franklin the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t v and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that claimed as a boyfriend the fifth one had to be katie she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her boyfriend franklin like the pushover he was the last but not least was noah gray franklin franklin was just scary it was like watching a terrible combination of and tj henderson only more annoying they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can't act eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly however b f before frank this show was funny and very entertaining,0
1511,there have been many movies about people returning home from wars and having to cope but the war at home is worth seeing portraying vietnam vet jeremy collier emilio estevez having trouble connecting with his texas family much of the movie is very likely to tense you up but nothing can prepare you for what ends up getting revealed br br part of what makes this movie so good is how it gives the viewer the feeling of both texas and of the generation gap jeremy's parents bob martin sheen and kathy bates clearly have a problem with their son's attitude both about the war and his rejection of americanism his sister karen kimberly williams is uncertain with whom to side but after the dinner there can be no neutrality br br so we as americans may never be able to fully get over the vietnam war but this movie can probably help us look seriously at how it affected so many people emilio estevez certainly did a good job directing also starring corin nemec and carla,1
1512,food always makes a good topic in movies as chocolat showed babette's feast is the same type of thing babette stephane is a french cook who flees her native land after the repression of 1871 she moves to a very religious danish village the people in this village simply have no use for joy that is until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals br br it's not just that this movie deals with bringing fun to a place that has never known it like other scandinavian movies and non hollywood movies in general it shows that a movie can hold your interest without the use of explosions car chases etc this is one movie that you can't afford to miss br br one more thing do you think that the danish word for feast sounds a little bit like,1
1513,or is this another way below the bottom of the barrel masterpiece preferably both somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again nothing more needs to be explained asked or screamed out loud if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk then you know what's in store with scream baby scream the title sounds cool it's just the weak script that should have gone someplace else even so this is hands down the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic mastery ever worked on film br br if you thought this is an early slasher which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment better luck next time the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie which supposedly tells of a blue faced psychopath out to kill and make some ugly facial sculptures on his victims it feels like you're watching another early scooby doo episode my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in and hooray for an actress under the name for giving us the worst facial makeover ever 1969 has never been this bad but it is br br try finding this 30 year old rarity at a bargain basement for five bucks it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power bad fashions and trashy music interesting note scream baby scream is also listed in troma's film archives on the company's website only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s cheapies gosh knows they need to plan 9 is history,0
1514,i had seen this movie just days before halloween 2004 i noticed it around lunch time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv you know after conan but before the infomercials sorta deal br br although this movie has very little to do with webs it does have a lot to do with spiders refer to my heading if you need a refresher br br i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating a hidden nuclear generator a scientist and a believable portal would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 15 20 minutes br br the cast is poor with no memorable performances poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified considering spiders don't carry breasts as well as poor sound effects an obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried br br spoiler br br 4 electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job they fiddle with the buttons and open a portal 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes scrambling to figure out what is going on the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundings br br help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension they encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers after a death and chase they are saved by survivors br br now it gets boring they hide talk a bit try to build another portal then attack the hive after losing 2 more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our world some 200 million years ago br br sounds interesting huh,0
1515,that's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick we couldn't believe how stupid it was i think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up well i guess the joke is on us br br i guess i should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is horrible stupid and on and on and boy are they right although it did provide some pretty good laughs me and my friends were pretty drunk because it is so stupid we just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie i swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when i looked on here it said it was made in 2001 what it sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today but i guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors btw some of those chicks or were they drag queens we couldn't tell were so fugly even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50 foot pole br br so there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad don't waste your time or money on this one you'll be completely disappointed,0
1516,i can't remember the worst film i have watched total waste of actors and audience time if you prefer sitting by your tv and think when will be this film over then this is the right film for you maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that moscow has some mystique past but i must say i have not expect anything else from rade serbedzija but i have expected more from vincent gallo the film lacks a plot character development denouement entire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique i must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor over and over are the same pictures total waste of time,0
1517,all through his career hitchcock did great films this was not one of them br br a man knows too much his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama br br anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films 'm' comes to mind will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace darkness and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to br br what it is worth watching out for however is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion the camerawork is lively the cuts are interesting and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly here you can see the future master hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it,0
1518,after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent the boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void br br a scene where the two boys' dominate the of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all the only character that was worth watching was played by the castle's stephen curry his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs br br a word for this flic is boring save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it,0
1519,i never realized what a fabulous dancer lana turner was until i saw this movie she was only 19 years old and gorgeous what a pleasure to watch her dance with george murphy the story line was typical for its day but the dancing was really special i never tire of watching fred and ginger but lana turner in this movie was just as terrific i always thought of lana as a so so actress who tended to over act she should have done more dancing and less of the x and peyton place roles i had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dancing too bad the academy doesn't give an oscar for dancing,1
1520,excellent movie in many aspects vicente has succeeded in depicting the time 1830 with meticulous care the light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie and along with it in opposite to what happened to mad love la a rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is wrapping a very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way br br concerning the actors paz vega as carmen is outstanding liar seductive totally sexual so beautiful carmen is a little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie i recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year,1
1521,this film was probably the best scary film i've seen in years chilling might be a more accurate description the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept since noone truly knows that answer you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky however since the focus was on sara novak carly pope her performance anchored the movie the at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie thankfully watch this movie you should enjoy it br br t,1
1522,well what can i say what the f k there really isn't much to say about this really the only way you would like this is if u like me like bad bad horror to laugh at br br acting very unconvincing just watch the last scene with the main actresses running rip off of texas chainsaw massacre but in a bad way just awful br br gore really not believable in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc by using this with the addition of red ketchup its supposed 2 look real although it really doesn't br br plot predictable get lost in woods on camping weekend' movie ripped off from friday the 13th br br killer quality scary mask if you're scared of clowns kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror camp movies out there br br total 3 10 p s stay away from camp blood ii that one made this look like lord of the rings,0
1523,the scarlet coat is about arnold betraying his country but he really isn't in the movie too much the main focus is on major cornell wilde and major andre micheal wilding wilding steals the movie as a officer and a gentlemen also as a to as tries to uncover who is the man leaking to the british wilde has to deal with the british the dr o dell george sanders who watches his every move and love anne francis this is a very enjoyable movie,1
1524,my wife and i both remembered this film being a lot better than it is when we rented it last weekend we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years or so ago we both agreed that we were probably remembering the tv series which in its one hour segments was compelled to actually wrap up plot lines this movie leaves many loose threads as has been mentioned by others here basically every main character's story line is left unresolved br br gotta like the title song though,0
1525,the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour but nothing more the agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling so the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because take a deep breath the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad you don't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company br br what a load of excrement looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of grip on this region for 45 years but no it was the american war on iraq which is also responsible for earthquakes tropical storms and the constipation i had last week br br the film ignores the fact that 95 of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight beat her up then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her no one sees this or calls the police and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase even better we later see 4 5 women lined up in the centre of london in again broad daylight to be sold one of them has a smashed face and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening you can't make this stupidity up br br i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood but apparently i was mistaken,0
1526,this episode of charmed changed everything the show is about to end it's third season and all hell is breaking loose in this episode the charmed ones bring an innocent named dr griffiths to the manor the protect him from the sources assassin when attacks he blasts in as a tornado and then into his demon skin he blasts threw a wall which totally knocks her out and practically kills her then blasts piper threw what is left of the wall phoebe comes from the attic and says the vanquishing spell before came kill the doctor but being the power of one it just wounds him leo comes to heal the other sisters and wants to find and destroy him for real phoebe meanwhile is in the underworld trying to find cole when and piper go out into the street to find the demon the demon finds them after their battle the witches realize that a camera caught everything when they get back to manor trying to battle the media and after they vanquished a a witch gone kookoo shoots piper uses her telekinesis to move people out of the way so she can get to the hospital but they get their to late and piper dies and just when is about to get shot time is rewound to where they bring dr griffiths to the manor blows in and blasts and piper but phoebe is still in the underworld so kills the doctor and blasts out of the manor when leo finally comes he can't heal is dead and so is the power of three for now personally this episode was sad was the of all of them i would love to have her power of telekinesis i really don't think phoebe should of went to the underworld because if she didn't wouldn't have killed but paige brings the power of three together again and i'm happy with the show's progress,1
1527,definitely a must see for all fans of film noir br br thanks to a fine script and crisp razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller br br wonderful characterizations articulate the movie's powerful message of racial and religious tolerance it's difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn't a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling br br making this film in the 1940s would have taken a lot of courage now all these years later at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language bare breasts crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it's refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like crossfire br br another low budget gem from the hollywood archives,1
1528,do you like explosions how about fighting well this movie has both of those you know the other thing you can't have a movie without a kick ass motorcycle the type that bounces off someone's head and knocks them out at the same time you bet the has one there's even a classic cliff scene br br all in all i'm quite proud that i have even seen this movie and even prouder to have my review be the first one yes,1
1529,this spaghetti western uses three american lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura the plot is about an amnesty that the governor of new mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a licence to kill because even new crimes like e g threatening the governor are forgiven the story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more carcasses only the few leads have stamina clay mccord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where unsurprisingly he killed a lot of people in the middle of the everlasting mayhem this kind of reflections lack credibility compared with similar films like e g none of the characters in this film was likable for me br br apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average br br 4 10,0
1530,bob cummings is excellent in this as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today priscilla lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other blonde's that worked with hitchcock later she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today br br there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today every person in the cast performs well there are several great backdrops in the black white film br br this was the first film at universal for hitchcock long run between the feature films he did at universal plus the television series hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there this fact gets lost in film history br br norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it,1
1531,even before this film it is clear to see that ali g has become the exact character he set out to parody i am not a fan of sacha baron cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke br br a paper thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and i must admit i did cringe when i saw such respected thespians as charles dance and michael stoop so low for employment saying that i must admit even if i am quite ashamed to that i did raise a titter on more than one occasion and however bad this film was it was never boring and never once did i consider switching it off mainly due to the gorgeous saying that only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious,0
1532,well ok i've seen wrath of the ninja br br it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie with a complex plot it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 swords of sorcery i saw the subtitled version not recommended by the way it's easy to miss something and i didn't really keep up with it all it had some good scenes tough but in general it wasn't much to my liking,0
1533,thus starts one crazy summer the evil twin of better off dead how can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by david lee roth br br this movie is a total blast pairing again john cusack with curtis armstrong but this time adding bobcat to the mix has great funny results hyperactive bobcat grates the nerve of everyone around curtis ak ak is the son of a deranged military with pacifist tendencies and demi moore with natural breasts wow as the love interest of once again chronically depressed cusack br br the story is well simple enough the laughs are there but both savage steve holland films have a certain quality to them they are funny but they are also sweet the scene where curtis finds a blown up doll in the target practice beach and begins about how a little girl won't be able to sleep was dumb funny and touching the animation used throughout is quite surreal the boat is hysterical complete with u sail and plush doll overall a fun film though not as good as better off dead,1
1534,i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is i surely could add various adjectives here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twisted minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie br br this was one of those movies that in a way did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either br br was it a complete waist of time yes which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that,0
1535,telly savalas hams it up as the mexican revolutionary though he's matched by chuck connors as a military martinet in this jokey yet rather boring pastiche on the famous historical figure's life and times an earlier attempt villa rides 1968 with yul brynner in the role and co starring robert dealt with these events more soberly and on a grander scale as such pancho villa is an all too typical european venture and an undistinguished one at that despite its credentials the end result is more often silly rather than amusing though a few moments most notably the action set pieces and a scene involving a brawl inside a church offer some mild pleasure oh and savalas even gets to sing over the end titles,0
1536,this mini series is iconic of the australian spirit while there may be what are perhaps considered glaring inconsistencies the film portrays a spirit that is unique to australia and one that should be cherished if anything this mini series demonstrates the aussie sense of humour the ability to laugh at the supremely ridiculous our willingness to have a laugh in even the most dire of situations while a large part of this series focuses on and how humour can be used as a means of survival it also has elements of drama that are evoke real emotions the main actors who appear are absolutely sensational and very convincing in their different roles capturing the essence of their characters perfectly this mini series should be mandatory viewing for all australians,1
1537,mishima is one of the greatest films ever made now i think paul schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but i don't really like the films he's directed of what i've seen with the exception of this and affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3 dimensional character study it follows the life of yukio mishima japan's most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories i don't know how but paul schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing truly an underrated gem of a film,1
1538,i watched all three segments and am so disappointed in the story line spends so much time mimicking duvall he does nothing else in the show and tommy lee jones would never be so weak as a young man unlikeable yes but weak never we never see how or why they go to back to lonesome dove which is a dirt hole in the original why would they ever leave austin where they are hero's for doing nothing during the whole movie i was rooting for blue duck by the end of the movie and he was totally miscast there is no warning about how many segments there are it just ends this mini series could have been somebody tragic it looked like it was directed by the parrot and the jag,0
1539,the problem with making a movie like this though is that the finale the crème de la creme of the movie the battle between the two souped up ships must be done well disappointingly this scene in is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub there's no tension little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the stand off br br the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story as all true stories do when converted to a movie such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart madsen a virginia belle br br it resorts to making a possibly decent movie involving an interesting story on the to preaching about the evils of slavery it was out of place in this historical drama and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film,0
1540,this movie even calling it a movie is an overstatement is ridiculously horrible normally a huge fan of eric roberts in b list movies this tragedy of a flick makes me question his real b list clout and charlie please go back to hoping for a diagnosis murder revival rather than this you can't blame the nameless eye candy beauty pageant members for participating in this weak movie but you are a former tv star man pull yourself together don't even get me started on stuart pankin for the sake of all that is good stuart you should have seen this was not necessarily a real movie bryan michael exemplifies absolute genius only in the fact that he was able to dupe anyone into investing in this picture money or time br br really this was no parody or spoof movie although it tries on a 2nd grade level mostly it is poor writing and acting and camera work and editing and well poor everything i watched it because i read an article in some mag about agent mj's involvement and my interest was peaked due to the lawsuit in which he was involved i now wonder if the only reason they show him from the shoulders up in the movie is because he like at the trial showed up wearing bottoms and barely lucid wait a second is he ever really considered lucid i digress and agent mj is that the best they could come up with for a name for his character sheez what a startling piece of originality or maybe that was supposed to be funny putting marriott into the movie was a nice touch at first but overdone and annoying after all is said and done br br spare yourself the grief of watching don't say i didn't warn you,0
1541,collected the audience wherever it was shown it gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world and it is not strange we have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art and it is wise by the way is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up but most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the european union br br the main character of the film is a french student of economy xavier for his future carrier his is sent for one year of studying to barcelona in spain it turns out that the lectures are being given in catalonian language that probably doesn't help the of knowledge but it helps in tightening the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students especially if they rent a big flat together there are 3 girls english belgian and spanish as well as three boys german danish and italian our french guy will also get there a year is a very long time long enough to get close and make friends and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apart br br treats this special case of a process of uniting europe with humor and without he comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same they like jokes they like to make irresponsible relationships but they don't neglect their aspirations the most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community they live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality they are full of unusual ideas for life young europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own they are europe's hope to fight the many problems of the union for example the terrifying administration system in the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences but they also now how to live the full of life and they won't allow taking that full of life away from them,1
1542,i remember watching this movie when it came out as a t v movie of the week in the early 1970's br br although i haven't seen this movie in over 30 years i remember how creepy it was the sister's dead body in the basement the storm raging outside the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises br br they just don't make t v movies like this one anymore elizabeth montgomery was a very underrated actress and i liked her in not only but several of her post bewitched roles such as this one and 1975's the legend of lizzie borden br br i really wish that someone would come out with a dvd that has several of the 1970's t v movie of the week on one dvd wouldn't it be awesome to watch when michael calls bad ronald don't be afraid of the dark crowhaven farm etc all on one dvd i know there is a market for a dvd like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's maybe if we are lucky someday someone will offer us a dvd with a great selection of t v movies like this,1
1543,i can't help thinking that this is franco's to the marquis de sade's one thousand days of people in this case women abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite check kinky sex check torture including whipping check victims chosen at random to be killed check br br thank goodness franco didn't go the whole hog and introduce cinema audiences to the delights of and indeed another perversion that crops up repeatedly in de sade's tediously long and disgusting saga br br i rather hoped that this film would fall into the 'so bad it's good' category but even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters didn't make up for the dismal dialogue dreadful acting elusive plot and just to put the tin hat on it dubbing and english sub titles a belt and braces approach missing from the women's costumes the gave a very professional performance though br br of course i could be wrong about the de sade angle after all i failed to realise that the actor playing the head warden at the was a trans sexual i must pay more attention to the size of people's hands in future br br according to another reviewer the film was banned in the uk well it clearly isn't any more though i fancy that the nipple scene was cut to satisfy the censors on the dvd i watched it was only clearly visible on the spanish trailer which in case you're wondering i watched to compare it with the english one br br the dvd also features an interview with jess franco though you'll need better spanish than mine to understand it unless i'm much mistaken it's neither dubbed nor sub titled and it points out that the person sodomising the character played by franco is wilson disguised using a moustache kind of ironic given that s he had had the requisite appendage surgically removed,0
1544,remake of the classic 1951 the thing from another world 12 men are in a completely isolated station in they are invaded by a thing from outer space it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to it starts off as a dog but gets loose and has a chance to duplicate any of the men soon nobody trusts anyone else they're isolated the radio is destroyed their helicopter likewise what are they going to do br br the 1951 film had the thing just be a big super human monster that movie was scary this one is too but the story is different and based more closely on the source material the novelette who goes there and it's scary in a different way the movie starts right off with ennio morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and when the thing gets attacked the amount of gore is astounding there's blood and body parts flying all over arms are bitten off heads detach and in the strongest one one man is devoured face first by the thing the gore effects are strong and real nightmare material i don't scare easy but i had to sleep with the lights on when i saw this originally back in 1982 rob effects are just incredible how this picture got by with an r rating is beyond me br br it also has a very creepy feel gore aside it is very suspenseful you're not sure who is what and carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension one complaint no one is given any distinctive personality traits they actors just remain straight faced and say their lines that's annoying but the movie still works br br this was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 it competed with e t and many critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie it's now considered one of john carpenter's best a must see for strong stomaches not a date film br br an amusing note when this was released universal sent a note along with all prints of the film they suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms they were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up,1
1545,boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music which is my favorite subject but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life time but for his own self destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35 being virtually during his life time because of the politics played by some people particularly the italian composer who was jealous of him br br personally i was shocked to see as the director has invariably cut pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day the movie is a disaster the two musicians in the movie don't give you any feeling of being realistic the film is tasteless meaningless and total failure on every count the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol who at least knows how to act otherwise the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs br br the irony is that while watching the movie the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended i wish i could take darshan and co to court not only for copyright infringement but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art,0
1546,as a big fan of tiny toon adventures i loved this movie it was so funny it really captured how cartoons spent their summers,1
1547,spoilers br br i don't care what anyone says this movie is friggin' hilarious this is the sequel to jack frost a movie about a killer snowman the snowman is created when a convicted serial killer about to be executed is taken to the execution chamber but the truck crashes with a truck carrying dna manipulation chemicals that make human dna bond with dirt or in this case snow the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him br br or so they thought br br this movie takes place about a year after the second some scientists resurrect jack frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals no explanation is ever given for why they do this they just do meanwhile the who arrested frost in the first is going to the bahamas unfortunately the snowman comes with him br br this movie has it all it has talking carrots that can stand up ice cubes that explode when you stick them in your mouth and killer snowballs yes killer snowballs they even say dada like babies i'll have to give the makers of this credit the snowballs are some of the cutest little things ever dreamed up i wish that i could get one as a pet frost finally freezes the island as if a killer snowman has the ability to influence major weather patterns br br then there's the actors there's manners the fbi agent from the first movie except here he's wearing an eyepatch shiver me timbers i be an fbi agent and then there's the stereotypical british adventurer and the stereotypical black jamaican with dreadlocks and finally captain fun the man on the face of the planet bar none br br this movie isn't scary but is is hilarious i laughed my butt off the whole way through and i recommend this for anyone who likes a good bad movie br br out,1
1548,what starts off fairly well and quite disturbing quickly sinks into an annoying mess br br dee snider of twisted sister infamy apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea and while the idea of a cyber stalking pierce freak has potential they really blow it here on uneven pacing bad dialogue and one of the greatest non endings you'll ever see despite some lifeless performances the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel this really looks like it's going to be a good low budget effort br br no such luck the plot goes all over the map and character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue worse the supporting cast barely registers and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet br br what a waste of a great idea oh and there is a new twisted sister song if you care,0
1549,whoever plays the part of j douglas williamson in the strip poker scene does a wonderful job he apparently received no credits too bad br br all the dead end kids do their jobs beautifully in this 1939 entry it is odd to watch them in a western setting with their brooklyn accents i guess that should be bowery they even show some swimming abilities br br i think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing love crime story my favorite right now is in the fight scene near the end of the film busby berkeley shows his dance movie expertise when john garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move the camera moves up to his face i will not give away why or when but the look on his face at that point probably brought the 1939 audience to its feet in the theaters br br some will think john garfield looks a lot like frank sinatra in many scenes just his face actually frank was not yet making movies so maybe frank looked like john the boxer named smith in the movie looks like a clone of ed begley jr br br now i must tell you something that is not a spoiler but if you watch the movie watch grandma's hands may robson does her part well she seems to have hands that wander a bit in a scene where she and a crowd go into the boxer's john garfield dressing room watch where she touches the reclining john garfield while he is wearing only his trunks br br a great ending lots of wonderful characters br br best line might be at the gas station eight gallons that's a dollar twenty eight tom willett,1
1550,this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched the story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander all the story was about was having sex over and over again there was no need for all of this footage only to create a soft porn film of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes i don't know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie except i assume to get men to watch it i gave it 1 out of 10 only because there was no other rating lower don't waste your money or time it has nothing to do with science fiction but rather a movie for young adolescent boys to watch to see t a the creature was shown only more than half way through the movie and looked like the alien in the movie with weaver poor excuse for entertainment,0
1551,this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age inventing some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be hip in the parlance of that age to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch i was embarrassed br br to make matters worse the music in the disco was not realistic at all it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60's br br mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies' man he just looks grotesque hawn's wide eyed innocence is just too silly the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce painful pitiful mess,0
1552,after i've seen this movie i find it hard to understand why so many people seem to hate this movie i'm not saying it belongs in the top 250 of all times but in it's genre it is a great movie i know not many people find it amusing to see how a legendary story like 'robin is turned into a comedy many people still seem to believe that some things shouldn't be laughed with they are wrong br br mel brooks has done an excellent job with robin hood men in tights i have seen the original robin hood movies as well but i never had such a good time when watching them as i had with this one it's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies winston the godfather br br i recommend everyone who wants to have a good laugh to watch this movie to those who think robin hood shouldn't be messed with you're wrong but you better don't watch it because you'll probably be offended by it i give this movie an 8 10,1
1553,what can i say about the series dubbed the new outer limits hmm only that this was one of the best tv series ever assembled you have actors of all ages the actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot everyone playing their part to exact perfection these shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time if not all the time is very true you can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly not only do these shows have great story lines they also throw you into them get your mind racing and your blood pumping the original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right these shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which i have never seen the new twilight zone with forest whitaker was fun to watch but the new outer limits is where it's at if you have not seen i implore you to please check these episodes out and you will see exactly what i mean long live the new outer limits,1
1554,i liked this show from the first episode i saw which was the rhapsody in blue episode for those that don't know what that is the zan going insane and becoming 10 ep best visuals and special effects i've seen on a television series nothing like it anywhere,1
1555,combine good casting bad writing good orchestral scoring bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream br br just bought the movie for a buck it is worth it but not much more br br good to see mark hamill act again br br there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place br br score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits however the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score br br it is really easy to dog a movie like this after all it is by the producer of and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is and that ain't much br br favorite line we're going to make it ha ha boom,0
1556,a sparkling movie bb is a marvel she's sultry she is a feminist she is still very much in love br br the movie features paris in the 50's it is wonderful to look at the sites the cars ds and br br a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy the music is horrendous it almost on the other hand it is hilarious but it is probably the only thing amiss at least looking at it with 21st century eyes br br the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity it is that sense modern a movie like un elephant se did it in an 80's way but the basic premise stays the the same br br thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity,1
1557,what a waste of time to watch this movie poor picture quality poor sound poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts the deputy's girlfriend did so much overacting as did the sheriff that it was more comedy than horror the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911 problem in 1957 that emergency number was not in existence that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies br br the scary aspect was way underdone just did not come across as horrific br br i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayal br br sorry this one just does not get it,0
1558,we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set under the title the broken skull shot directly onto video with widely varying sound and lighting quality this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness confusion and irritability and not in a good evil dead kind of way br br without going into spoilers what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre while there are some interesting ideas here the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying hunh br br this is a very very gory movie the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze framed to be dis believed the fangoria level of gross out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side br br the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie it features not only ambient noises captured by mikes and not replaced in post but there is a lot of shrieking no no i mean a lot a lot a lot characters scream wail howl and yell and laugh maniacally turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining in particular the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto br br in fact very few of the actors were wooden some of them may have overacted a bit oh just a wee smidgen but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that the two middle aged white women however are two of the most spiteful exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic the brute man just watch them seethe at all the other characters it's fun br br in closing the may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees michael myers or freddy kruger or even the leprechaun but we can definitely say this this was a movie,0
1559,this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least the basic plot is 3 old business associates invite 2 strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with 10 bucks in it the two whom show up fall in love the 3 older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out okay so that may make sense but then we have 3 old guys whom apparently have some bread living together slightly weird here harry carey plays his part way off base you can't tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick i mean really make up my mind i can handle it then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texas hmmmmm he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas this one isn't even close then we take the 3 ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character you can avoid this one,0
1560,my friend i rented this movie and within the first 5 mins we had no idea what was going on it felt like it should have been over within the first 15 mins it was a terrible movie my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the ones in the movie and the plot if you can call it that was full of holes never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy yet anybody i actually like,0
1561,i just don't understand why anytime someone does a show about one of the largest metro areas in the country houston dallas austin san antonio etc they portray the average person as someone who wears wranglers cowboy hat talks with a drawl has zero fashion sense and drives a truck on his way to either the saloon or his next hunting trip rodeo skeet shooting or country music concert i have never even seen a small town cop driving a police truck anywhere in texas br br the funny thing is this is not done for artistic reasons or comedy they are actually serious and i guess believe the average person is too stupid to know the difference the bad scripts and equally bad acting give that away this show makes goofy shows in the past like knightrider look like high brow entertainment at least knightrider had the talking car,0
1562,a very strange disturbing but intriguing film i don't think i ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and i doubt if i'll ever want to see it again that said there is much to be amused by like take on jayne classic walk in the girl can't help it and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store a gritty feel very much like a russ meyer film generally poor acting with the notable exception of divine,1
1563,avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment br br it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school seriously where to they get these people from just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress br br patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder,0
1564,three ten year old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them br br while killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film bloody birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities it a fine line between cheesy and creepy but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot there's some strong murder scenes as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure br br the cast does a fairly good job young stars elizabeth hoy and k c martel deliver some menacing performances while rising star julie brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene veteran star susan strasberg does well as the teacher and jose ferrer has a cameo appearance br br all around this off beat slasher entry isn't bad though it's admittedly not flawless but it is well worth watching for genre fans br br out of,1
1565,this movie tries to say something profound i'm just not sure what it was too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there when the mother finally unveils it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence what was the point of the boy not talking was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power what was the scene with the burnt girl all about another power the boy has or what i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow br br there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained i didn't buy the link very much i also found the teacher getting on addison about not saying here for roll call a bit much the mom seeing the doctor was pointless how did it serve the plot was that to show how desperate the mother was getting or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get was that the dad coming back in the last scene or just some guy so did writing on the wall work what happened to the dog,0
1566,heart of darkness movie review joseph conrad's heart of darkness is pretty dark deep and very profound i would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie the character mr kurtz played by john was totally the wrong actor to do the part he fit the character in of mice and men the movie left out man key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story br br the movie is poorly edited it shows a lot of non important and annoying flashes in the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling in the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader for example when marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie in the novel marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the novel the movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn't make sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him that kind of just ruined everything didn't make any sense to me what so ever so my suggestion to you is don't view the movie just read the book you will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story br br chris c,0
1567,wonderful songs sprightly animation and authentic live action make this a classic adaptation of a classic tale a nice british feel which sets it apart and above from the standard saccharine sweet disney cartoons,1
1568,i loved this film i have been waiting for this film to come out so i could see it i saw it opening night and loved it some people told me that this film wasn't any good and to stay away but i thought it was great the actors did great and it was scary and made me jump paris hilton did a great job for her first film everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role the set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made the two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great the killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them i can't wait until this film comes out to video so i can get it and see it over and over again the over view of my review is go see this film if you like films and you will not be sorry i loved this film i give this film a 10 out of 10 it rocks,1
1569,in thailand the americans connor colin and his girlfriend amanda meredith monroe quarrel in a thai fight and amanda leaves connor alone she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger indeed the mean vampire don hetrakul and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles connor joins to a clan of good vampires leaded by sang stephanie chao trying to save amanda from the claws of br br i expected that vampires the turning were a good movie the locations and the cinematography are beautiful the very heavy music score is excellent stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive but unfortunately the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts the story is very short and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film my vote is four br br title brazil vampiros a vampires the conversion,0
1570,i just watched this short at the movies br br was a very sweet sad little movie about two brothers that are in love there is some great subtle acting from both the male leads often times movies with this subject matter seem to get too caught up in the controversy and shock value of the plot that they forget that there is an actual story luckily writer director james does not do this and instead lets the story play out with honesty the sequences of the two boys first falling in love are very sweet,1
1571,firstly this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive etc the weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of wonder it is somewhat to me personally but the movie really works in that respect and it is to be scary so i give it credit for that yup a few points there for those scalpels and well damned disturbing idea of getting alive br br but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot characterization or real surprises the whole teen flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple predictable way lots of moments creepy guys who are insane and the big question of all is the boyfriend the murderer this movie fits into the category of scream and countless others which have spawned over the 90s well i won't spoil it for you but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer we find out who it is half way through and from there on the movie on trying to fill in some time rather boringly to say the least i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie br br the lead actress is great as usual but the acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane but she is the one who really knows whats going on and the cops ahhh they just laugh and eat donuts very predictable flat disturbing at times and most of all boring and dull it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign hmmm or did they br br,0
1572,overall the dad's army movie is very funny although the humour isn't quite as catchy and sparkly as in the tv and radio series so where does this leave us the viewers if you've never seen dad's army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of walmington o s the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side br br for dad's army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a of the tv series but it's a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the bbc video recordings br br the movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe i can't make up my mind if that's a positive or a negative though,1
1573,despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while i have always loved a piece of the action because it is so much fun i really do have to cast my vote as this episode as being the very best br br the movie interestingly enough is really like a wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after a raid on federation outposts in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain curt jurgens are shown in counter point as they both try to outwit the other and in the process develop a grudging respect for their foe br br interestingly enough only a short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on a planet and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the leader oddly for the die hard trekkers out there they'll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock's father br br the bottom line is this is simply a great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat,1
1574,first what is really great about this movie br br ryan reynolds great acting there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters br br the soundtrack very good music played at the right time br br the idea of a nine lost in his own world incapable of leaving br br still i give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws br br horrible second part it seems that the director was very eager to make something new but despite of the efforts it was really boring br br very annoying character melissa i couldn't stand the scenes with her i e it was constantly annoying she represents everything that is wrong with american woman br br terrible explanation of the numbers the director was so busy with character development that he completely missed the point of a good story excuse me terrible br br this movie had great potential the filming is nicely done the music is really good but nothing more br br see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds or have a lot of time to spare,0
1575,i rented this dvd because i'm a big science fiction fan but this thing i won't call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along i'm still not sure what it was about there's these guys dressed up in some weird s m outfits and i guess they're from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film if it was their first film i'd cut them some slack but i think it's like their 5th film and it's really really bad br br very bad acting not one good actor is this movie this director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this don't waste your time or money on this dvd please people don't it is not even worth the 99 cents i paid to rent the dvd in fact i'm going to tell them the dvd was messed up to get my money back i don't believe in giving anything at all a bad review but i must here my advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship please find another profession to get into how could you make a rotten movie like this i would give this negative stars if possible it's that terrible,0
1576,so boring you'll fall asleep after the 20 first minutes sorry mr i do admire your work all these beautiful films you directed such as sans etc but here the plot is extremely vain except the magnificent photography everything appears dumb and there's no envy to know what will happen at these medium actors moreover the dialogs are the famous question where are the children is repeated so often it looks like a farce believe me it's a pure waste of time concerning the plot and 3 hours is a long long time certainly the real reason of this box office total mess,0
1577,this film isn't a comedy its an expose i've always hated dog shows considering the ridiculous get ups people put their dogs in and the idiotic names they give them hence the reason for my uncontrolled cackling while watching this film i get a kick out of something being taken so seriously even though the gains are small and insignificant it's like miniature golf or jump championships or the need to set some obscure world record the acting was much more refined in this film than waiting for guffman and its mainly due to the more fluidity of the characters who seem more comfortable with their specific acting partners in this film than the previous eugene levy was great as was michael and fred willard however it was the dogs who eventually stole the show but then again who wants to see a bunch of humans in a film about dogs anyway,1
1578,this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more seriously do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured boring although the acting is fine the kid is just plain irritating some scenes are a little strange with very weird close ups i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably there was just nothing to watch and although its a sad tale supposedly its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters,0
1579,i caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen however since it is supposed to be an action movie i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional br br chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film good thing too the sub par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast actually the judge was pretty good but i can't really describe what makes him work you'll have to check it out for yourself br br and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic,0
1580,there are lots of other comments here about how poor this film is what i wanted to point out is how this film took the largest science project in history and made it look small the manhattan project was an incredible achievement and it was huge virtually all silver in the country went into making wire for electromagnetic if there was every a choice between two alternative ways of doing things they just did both the first sustained nuclear reactor was fired up under the stands of the university of chicago football stadium with graduate students wielding axes as a mechanism it's a fascinating story involving hundreds of locations and thousands of people that this film seems to reduce to a small group of eccentrics in new mexico br br the other thing i really disliked was the huge moral debate over if we should continue the project after germany surrenders okay we have thousands of mostly men who worked for years to make a really big boom does anyone think they didn't want to see it work there was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device but it was not that serious clearly not the huge debate this film makes it out to be,0
1581,during ww2 in the japanese soldiers are starving dying growing weak and becoming more and more insane a small group of soldiers trying to stay alive have eventually resorted to cannibalism this film perfectly portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme conditions there are a few humorous parts in this movie but the majority of it is just a very slow moving and realistic film it follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another and eventually to death a very interesting film showing the death and the horror of what may have been the worst war the world has ever seen,1
1582,over 21 the film version of the ruth gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with garson kanin after he'd gone in the service provides irene dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen it's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in america about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first world war and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict br br the play ruth gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for 221 performances in 1944 on broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that gordon and harvey stephens who was the male lead had on a training base if you look on the broadway credits list it says that the production was by george s kaufman as opposed to being directed by him i'm not sure of the distinction but i can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as kaufman's it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night br br when columbia bought the screen rights sidney buchman had to do some considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow the film bears very little trace of its stage origins br br alexander knox plays the husband and charles coburn the employer of both dunne and knox who are writers knox has graduated to not only editor but featured columnist his words and thoughts help sell the paper and coburn is in a bind but knox feels he has to get into the war the seminal event of his time in order to speak authoritatively on the kind of post war world he wants this was not an uncommon theme in those years br br irene dunne has some good comic moments the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite cary grant in fact garson kanin directed both of them in my favorite wife a few years earlier coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart br br over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the allies and i mean all of them could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world still hopefully a new generation will get it right,1
1583,darr was a super hit film which was loved by many peoples it tells the story of shahrukh khans innocent obsession for juhi who loves sunny deol honestly it was a entertaining movie but if you look carefully its not too realistic shahrukh khan keeps phoning juhi and tells her that he loves her too bits he gives an announcement in college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful photos of her unfortunately instead of being flattered that a guy loves her too bits she gets very very scared i personally know 100s of people that get pranked by someone and these people enjoy it cos they play a long yash chopra gives us a good film that does entertain widely because of shah rukh khan's character sunny deol is suppose to be the main actor but darr belongs to shah rukh khan delivering a superb performance shah rukh khan is literally the villain of the movie but i would of been happy if he got the girl because he loves her so dearly sunny deol gives a decent performance but he beats up all those guys on his own and survives a brutal knife attack juhi chawla is cute as ever in a fairly good performance some good songs including tu mere being the best,1
1584,i saw this movie many years ago have tried to locate it but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found it was so esoteric yet one of a handful of movies that remains with you for a long time i am still not sure what the reality of the movie is and perhaps like the uncertainty principle the obscurity is the definite thing acting is superb the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of foreboding an overall permeates yet it is hard not to be absorbed in the story i rented it thinking it was science fiction it was in the sci fi section with some totally misleading blurb but quite clearly it is not or horror or even suspense in fact one feels thankful the director took the courage to make a movie like this for which obviously there is no solid audience i know some people have complained about klaus kinski's short role but i think it is very appropriate his limited exposure is critical to the formation of the mystery of this movie,1
1585,now maybe it had something to do with the fact that i saw this movie at a low point in my life when i was really trying to figure out where i was going and what i needed to make myself happy but this film really spoke to me jane is an although she has so many positive things going for her she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life she is strong and intelligent but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second choice life she seeks out new challenges and happiness seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart weber is an exquisite jane as we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair the torture of her desperation and eventually the strength of her conviction the beautiful is also very well cast and an asset to the production allison is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing i highly recommend this film although it's low budget it has big budget writing and production values ps great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women women will love the story and characters but there's something for the men here too,1
1586,an amazing film i've only just seen it and i already want to see it again i'd never heard of derek jarman before i saw this film but now i am i can't wait to see his others the film takes a whole new perspective of shakespeare's the tempest i'm sure he'd have appreciated it for use of the the play's themes of love magic darkness and atmospheric tension ok ok there may have been a bit of nudity in the film which i hadn't really anticipated but it didn't offend me it just surprised me and made the film more unpredictable one spoiler for those of a nervous disposition fast forward the flashback scene with and ariel as their slave its pretty graphic overall if you are starting to find kenneth branagh's shakespeare performances flaccid and monotonous then you need to see this film fantastic and surreal it'll blow you away but only if you let it have an open mind and then let this film work it's magic on you,1
1587,the prey has an interesting history unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of 1984 you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85 but little else is remembered the plot is your basic killer in the woods again but ironically this was filmed before friday the 13th the prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later but released for about a week at some drive ins yes jim drive in showed this in june of 84 but it has a dated look to it maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984 now on the story it has some kind of back story a forest fire back in the 1940's leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death but one of their children survive our monster so flash forward to present day which would be 1978 we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster the tag line for this picture claims its not human and its got an axe but an axe was only used in these first two killings now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20's camping we all know they are the prey and the monster knocks them of one by one for an 80 minute movie it seems longer we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins overall for being out into an 80 's horror movie it looks way more 70's than ever hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him side note the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the 1990's,0
1588,what's the point of this film it's totally forgettable unless you have a serious bunny fetish look elsewhere so the bunnies had a merit demerit list no chewing gum in front of the customers are we supposed to find that interesting,0
1589,i have searched for this movie for years i have great memories of the first rate acting and singing in this movie i never knew that the reason the movie was unobtainable was because of the actions of the gershwin family shame on them for trying to suppress at american classic i can only hope they will and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the american public br br sammy davis jr is at his absolute best in this film the only other performance of his this is it's equal was in another terrific film that i wish would be released on dvd br br bess contained a first rate all star cast hopefully one day you'll get to see for yourself,1
1590,this movie isn't even good enough for the 1 bin at the grocery store br br i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it guess he couldn't be too about his roles during this time br br the movie in itself was hard to sit through it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline the guys night out had to be the most boring i've ever seen one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry even the arguments were hard to follow most of the acting lacked any depth br br i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark,0
1591,i don't usually like this sort of movie but was working at home and wanted something to halfway watch while i did i got so engrossed i gave up working to just sit and finish watching the last half hour uninterrupted and i sure don't usually shed tears over this sort of show but i was crying at the end a lot of emotional nuance great acting and good southern feel john corbett is one of the most talented actors out there and the guy who played luke was really good too highly recommend,1
1592,i turned this off within the first five minutes it's very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it's skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously it didn't i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched 'eyes without a face' which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which spoilt my night as i couldn't hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentary br br reading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic,0
1593,it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time the historical aspect was great everything else was horrible the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time when there was evidence it would fly by most of it was just people talking about the place the episode of the show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this i haven't watched it since it aired,0
1594,me and a friends form university alberto lopez dave hall celina we graduated from uk in 1997 still get together and watch b movies once a month br br we are consummate experts in the art of bad movie making and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful brilliant movies br br so if you've just got the beers and weed in and need a film to laugh like a drain at droid gunner aka phoenix 2 is the film for you marc singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and milks it for everything he can hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound is that a word as he grunts but i want my 20 thousand pure shlock gold if you liked this also see trancers the dollman and anything by charles band or fred olen ray but be warned some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life,1
1595,why isn't this movie on the bottom 100 raptor is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done br br nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines like in or out you're worse than a cat and your lady friend isn't a very good poker player she's just revealed her hand br br the raptors are a joke even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done it is an insult to the actual velociraptors or any dinosaur for that matter not only that but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier besides the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away br br i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night like i did if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film i would have to quote dr alan grant from the first jurassic park br br just try to show a little respect,0
1596,this is a weak throw together of just about everything refugees croatia slovenia relations globalization sexual orientation a very big clumsy metaphor about slovenia being at the cross roads between its past which is symbolized by everything virgin becoming queen of the household and its future which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having kids br br it plays on a rather recent slovenian legend involving a virgin and a forest king assuming the shape of a goat imagery is also based on that legend but unfortunately the treatment is very incoherent weiss seems to think the end justifies the means she can use all kinds of dream like sequences and then pick and choose which ones true and which ones are imaginary how can the ride in the jeep with the forest king be real for all three girls but the scene outside the tent be real only in imaginary the ending just drags on and on i can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes have i been watching a director's cut without knowing it with the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking afraid and happy at the same time so obvious br br i never thought i could spot bad acting in a movie whose language i don't understand but it didn't take long to see that is over acting most of the time as if she was playing in a silent movie br br it wasn't so bad as i kept thinking the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was all about on film by doing a half experimental movie until i realized that the director was actually 37 years old when making the movie and that her work is probably serious,0
1597,my friends and i watched this movie last night it was pretty incredible by all means this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen at first it was tolerable it stunk of bad improv but it was pretty friggin hilarious despite the scenes being too long drawn out and the terrible quality i read 400 budget above sounds about right of the film itself br br the biggest problem came from the lack of a script with a background in improv i know how hard it can be to keep scenes short efficient what happened in this film was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes and they didn't know when to stop they just kept going for ages on stupid topics at first i thought this was because the movie was short and they needed long useless scenes to flesh it out as the movie progressed i realized it was just a really bad movie br br there were a lot of parts where i could see that the film maker had a really good idea for a shot but not the resources or talent to pull it off effectively a lot of the scenes were taken from a single shot cause you know improv for what felt like a really long time so boring if you can stand to put up with and hour and a half of terrible improv watch it it's really funny at parts but also really stupid and annoying the acting ranges from alright to absolutely terrible it seemed like the only good parts were the parts that really had nothing to do with the main plot the ballsy kid who swore lots the barbershop etc etc br br but yeah painfully bad like i was literally hurting after an hour or so my friends and i just got bored and left,0
1598,this is an oft used line but it really sums up this movie if this is the current state of gay cinema then we're in real trouble i saw this film at because of the high imdb rating 7 6 and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb then this is it just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film br br easy plot boy finds out his high school ex boyfriend is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown still carrying a 10 year old torch to see what happened br br first off i liked latter days the director's last feature despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release i don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans robert foxworth joanna cassidy tori spelling but somehow he managed to the writing was lifetime network quality way back when they were really bad and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch i kept reaching for a non existent remote control to fast forward but ultimately made myself stay to the end hoping for a decent ending ugh no even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats br br to be fair the 2 leads especially in the gratuitous nude scenes were gorgeous there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways and the film looked great good quality and color saturation for an independent film br br how is it that network tv can give week after week of great entertaining weekly episodes like ugly betty housewives etc but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this,0
1599,is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating because this one deserves it while i'm not a big fan of jane austen's books i sat through this one with two women who are well at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is robert hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing though he overdid it as he usually does nearly as bad as william shatner but that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total it's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is really happening and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax the lead actress is too ditsy and weird looking to be a heroine the leading man is too goofy looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter i mean saxophone mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing so in conclusion i suggest you blow the budget and order a dvd of this one as soon as possible especially if you like disappointment,0
1600,all i have to say is that this movie is the bomb you are going to cry when you see this i mean this is a reminder for everyone how hard and easy it is to fall in love it reminds you of the days during your youth when you were carefree and everything that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss even though i am still a teen this is how i live my life when i am with that certain someone everything that was negative in my mind was erased so i give this movie a 10 for it's heartfelt message and touching plot actors josh hartnett and chris klein i also give a 10 for having a cute face,1
1601,this thing takes the horny teenager genre very poorly respected to begin with and completely flushes it down the toilet the only people i would even consider recommending it to are teenage girls for a revealing scene in a boys' locker room and in the end i wouldn't make such a recommendation to do so would be to contribute to the delinquency of a juvenile an absolute piece of garbage with utterly no redeeming qualities,0
1602,this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites br br even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its argento and this may be biased but i'm gonna be giving it a good review anyway br br it does contain a lot of good ideas the subtle voyeuristic element the needles under the eyes the gory and disturbing deaths and the argento cliché flashback br br downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack acting and the ending br br all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end br br a fairly good film from argento but he as done better a lot better,1
1603,i absolutely hated this movie i was 9 when i saw it it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater my mom dad and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life everything about it was ridiculous the entire premise was too warped being 9 i was always easily entertained this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained,0
1604,romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for bellow from average movies and source of frustration for viewers this one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my top ten worst movies br br history is far from creative and jokes are weak i found no reason for a single laugh during all the movie characters are plain and the performance of the actors and just good history develops slowly it's tedious and foreseeable ending is also foreseeable and sugar coated br br this is one that movies you watch in a rainy saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to watch in my humble opinion,0
1605,stanley stupid tom arnold and his wife joan like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows they have two equally challenged children buster and petunia one day mr stupid notices their garbage is gone again there must be someone stealing it from the curb he goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck when he finally gets to the dump he is startled to learn not only that other folks garbage has been stolen too but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill he is determined to defeat the garbage of the world it seems meanwhile petunia and buster visit the police station and a chinese restaurant in search of their parents for joan comes up missing too will they bumble their way through their problems this is just a stupid stupid movie with the culprit being the terrible script the books by and marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from the books ends up in this film arnold is actually quite nice as mr stupid and the other cast members try very very hard to make the film work the production values are very high with the dog and cat belonging to the adding a little oomph to the film but it is all for naught as the plot is wandering and weak perhaps someday someone will take another stab at translating the very funny books to the big screen therefore if you love to laugh rent something else while you await a new production and by all means go get the books too but stay away from being stupid yourself as anyone who watches this movie to the end could hardly be called intelligent,0
1606,this was a decent movie for the first half too many cheap boo moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely the kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens br br then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard the why in the world would he they do that moments overwhelm anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped there was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny br br great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes,0
1607,a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen i was curious because it had developed a bit of a cult status i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot i have to agree with my friend it is a steaming pile of dung i am sorry to the people who love this movie but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film try peter jackson's dead alive aka braindead cemetery man aka or modern vampires,0
1608,remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath sounds like it could be an exciting western but this one is dull dull dull it moves like molasses the action scenes are uninspired the acting is pedestrian the writing is flat even the photography isn't very good eastwood in a very early role plays an ex confederate who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered a very ordinary western actually a very less than ordinary western worth a look if you're a die hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career otherwise don't bother,0
1609,hair is one of my favorite movies of all times even not being part of my generation i already watched this movie 9 times and i can't get enough with the beautiful message of understanding passion beauty and love this movie is against the vietnam war and shows how people should be united independent of the color origins religions and classes i love the characters berger and woof and i think central park of the 70's one of the most beautiful places i already saw in my life br br by the way i still have this music in my mind br br when the moon is in the seventh house and jupiter aligns with mars then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars br br this is the dawning of the age of aquarius the age of aquarius aquarius aquarius br br harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or decisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind's true liberation aquarius aquarius br br ps i am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of amadeus i just love both movies,1
1610,before the wwf became cartoon with hulk leading the way the events of wwf tv broadcasts of the very early 1980s resembled the wild wild west with all kinds of grudges and vicious acts of violence performed by some of the wrestlers that are known today to be the most beloved stars some of these seemingly very real moments stand out a maniacal sgt slaughter whipped then champion bob with a riding crop after showed him up in a fitness test were all over sarge made the iron shiek look like a daycare provider slaughter also issued a challenge to anyone who could break his dreaded cobra clutch hold this led a legendary and bloody alley match with commentator pat patterson hall of fame member blackjack mulligan with freddie came into the wwf with a claw hold that was censored on television he claimed he was the true giant at and challenged andre long before big john in 1984 adrian adonis used his ominously named good night irene sleeper to take out the competition a new yorker clad in black leather he was an ominous figure george the animal steele was far from a crowd pleaser as well even jimmy snuka was a fearsome sight as he set out opponents until ray the stevens delivered a piledriver onto the cement floor leaving snuka a bloody mess all these encounters took place a decade before hardcore wrestling was ever spoken of,1
1611,this slightly ponderous late 50's sci fi horror schlock isn't entirely a loser it's about a manned space rocket that crash lands in a remote area a bunch of scientists go to investigate and discover that the astronaut is in some kind of coma he's being kept alive by alien embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in him anyway the title alien monster soon raises it's head causing general havoc including partial head removal br br the main problem with the film is it's pacing it takes quite a while for the blood beast to appear and he really only comes into his own in the last 20 minutes or so he is undoubtedly a completely ridiculous creation but that's really not a problem as he provides a fair amount of comic relief at the end of the movie where we have the final stand off and this ludicrous creature starts talking with the voice of the doctor he killed earlier you will be doing well not to have a giggle so too in the brilliant x ray scene where we see the alien embryos floating about in the astronaut's body it's just too funny for words br br but unfortunately the fun moments in night of the blood beast come too few and far between if you're a 50's sci fi nut though then it's well worth checking this one out just don't expect too much,0
1612,young elijah wood and joseph are outstanding in this excellent film about two boys who have promised to take care of their mother and how they cope when their new stepfather begins beating the younger boy the supporting cast around the boys is top notch as well the script really gets inside the mind and heart of an imaginative child it's hard to believe wood could grow up to look anything like tom hanks but that's nothing new in hollywood that's honestly my only criticism of the film,1
1613,i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed although i like this film and was engrossed by the story i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat br br the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policewoman the location is a quaint korean village br br this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life in my mind he is a sweet noble loser br br good points excellent acting by the two main leads enjoyable snapshot of village life br br cons flat ending br br overall good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films or is it before sunset and after sunrise,1
1614,i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting a w o l however is a taut little thriller that hearkens back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or mcginley and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to reconcile the previous poster's comments with the film i saw a w o l is quite aptly written by shane black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously winking at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all a w o l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film,1
1615,this is bad movie there is no denying it as much as i'd like to tommy lee jones is about as good as he possible can be with the script they gave him and he had a couple of decent action sequences that felt really out of place due to their acceptable quality br br somewhere along the line someone figured that all of the shortcomings of script could be if they were to hire every single workhorse actor in the business unfortunately even truly deeply talented actors like goodman beatty sarsgaard gammon steenburgen macdonald pruitt taylor vince and lest we forget mr jones himself can't fix the wooden dialogue and plot progression that went absolutely nowhere br br in fact at one point i looked up sure that the movie had been running for the past 2 hours only to find that i was 51 minutes into it br br perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story other than slightly detracting from the confusing business at the end with the picture if you haven't seen this movie disregard this past statement which may seem tantalizing and know that it is not you will not understand it any better after having watched the movie br br the most interesting thing about this movie may be that it is actually a sequel to the movie heaven's prisoners starring alec baldwin in the same role carried by tommy lee jones in this movie i may have to watch it now first to see if it is as bad as in the electric mist and second because i can't seem to no matter how hard i try break my man crush on alec baldwin,0
1616,married to the mob was one of the first vhs tapes that i had along with coming to america and grease i still have fond memories of this film after all these years hell i still have the vhs of this film in good condition br br the story undercover cop mike downey matthew modine is sent to spy on angela de marco michelle pfeiffer the wife of the slain mafia member frank cucumber de marco alec baldwin he later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss tony the tiger russo dean stockwell she also has to deal with his jealous wife connie russo mercedes ruehl br br married to the mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny i like the little jabs it takes at mafia life the jealous mafia wife the mob boss that doesn't realize that he is not a chick magnet etc and you like the characters of angela de marco and mike downey it was the last of the funny phase of johnathan demme before he got serious and gave you gems like philadelphia and silence of the lambs best thriller of all time if you're in the mood for comedy married to the mob is a keeper its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays epic movie date movie meet the spartans disaster movie etc,1
1617,i have to admit i'm not a big fan of satanic horror movies and in fact i seem to like them less and less every time i see a new one and that isn't really surprising when i end up watching films like brotherhood of satan despite its low rating on imdb i was surprised to hear some good things about this film and my expectations went up this turned out to be a big mistake as this is exactly the film that its rating suggests it is namely a very bad one the plot is your basic bunch of satanists causing trouble and we focus on a small town where people have been murdered and kidnapped and it's not really clear why naturally satanists are behind it and this is bad news for a mother father and daughter on a road trip who become trapped in the mysterious town i had a feeling that this film might be along the same lines as the crappy satanist flick 'the devil's rain' and while it's not quite as silly as robert later film it's not much better either the plot seems to be fairly down to earth but it's also rather boring and i can't say that i enjoyed myself at all during this movie brotherhood of satan obviously has its fans but i'm not one of them this is a film that i see no reason to recommend,0
1618,it's a good watch if u have time deals with three friends who get into a needless bar fight and get into serious trouble they find themselves fighting some shadowy people and can't deal with very very disturbing portrayal of japan the arbitrariness of modern life some intense scenes but a bit of a potboiler br br the spoiler was that the plot is not too clear based on english sub titles obviously i don't know japanese br br the only other japanese movies i've seen were kurosawa who is a different and far loftier than this modern genre so can't really compare otherwise it compares better with most hollywood blockbusters for story plot and buildup br br,1
1619,not a box office success no one really knows why it may have failed simply because of its title it looks as though you need a two word tough guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd die hard lethal weapon hard weapon die lethal etc talking about the long kiss goodnight will get you nowhere but for once renny harlin has made a good action movie a large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character samantha earns our affection and interest early on as she becomes charly again we're torn we certainly want charly to thwart the bad guys and all that but we don't want her to lose touch with samantha in order to do so even though we like charly too geena davis all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character samuel l jackson plays second fiddle for a change it turns out he's good at it that was a compliment br br intelligent far superior to anything in the die hard series if i were more cynical i'd add it's not surprising that it didn't do well but i don't really feel that way it is surprising that it didn't do well,1
1620,thought provoking humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war a small but altruistic view of one family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie lessens the glamor of war showing it's effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit br br a lot of today's movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the hero's and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person's memory of those days this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie,1
1621,maybe in its day this movie was special but five decades later it seems quaint just another cinematic relic of the dreadful 1950s stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers who set up shop in a manhattan penthouse in an effort to attract wealthy husbands br br i don't mind the shallow theme but the film's premise is lame and the execution is worse it's a romantic comedy but i found little to laugh at the plot point about an extremely bimbo is about the only clever element of the story overall dialogue is flat and so too is the delivery and the script structure is disconcerting the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies it's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles the result is a plot that seems choppy br br marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played and betty grable with her squeaky voice and awful hairdo was just plain annoying br br color cinematography is conventional but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection contributing to a dated look the visuals are made even worse by costumes that reek of cheesy 1950's glamour they are just awful viewers must endure a fashion show a plot point that amplifies how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad rags br br and then there is that orchestra in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary sounding tune at first i thought i was watching the introduction to coming attractions but no it's actually part of the film and the orchestra plays on and on and on it has nothing absolutely nothing whatever to do with the story what were they thinking br br i enjoyed marilyn monroe with her breathy voice as she bimbos her way through the plot but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles dumped that orchestra enhanced the comedy dialogue and downplayed those gaudy cheesy costumes,0
1622,eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie like a remake of any of the old 'attack of the giant insert animal here ' movies of the 50s 60s and 70s or rather it should have been more like a remake of the instead of what is was so how is a monster movie done in the year 2002 well from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions they mix movies like gremlins jurassic park starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie gremlins is probably the best comparison but eight legged freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie it was way too much at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes br br for a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting and that is just the way it was the story though was extremely thin with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending br br i rate eight legged freaks a 4 10 and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious,0
1623,this movie was so bad it looked like a home movie in one scene the camera very slowly and gradually tilts down then moves back up into place again the sound is and occasionally fades out then in again in another scene the camera man is just visible in a mirror br br then came the scene with instructions how to put down a tent which believe me went on for ages and was completely irrelevant to the plot most scenes dragged on with conversations that were not entirely relevant either in my opinion these were just to fill out the movie and make it longer even with these scenes added it was very short br br the only good thing about it was the severed head which did look quite realistic,0
1624,somebody decided to make a black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes br br somebody decided to make a really really bad black version of airplane that ran out of humor after the first twenty minutes and instead spent all of its time insulting the intelligence of the audience and the cast br br this movie managed to violate the laws of physics by sucking and blowing at the same time if nothing else it deserves to be remembered for that accomplishment br br it's not a black thing it's not a white thing it's just a bad thing a really really bad thing picking it apart point by point would be a waste of time the best thing that can be said about the movie is that there was a purple airplane in it do yourself a favor go buy a picture of a purple airplane and you will have gotten the best of what this movie had to offer br br this one definitely goes under the category of what the were they thinking,0
1625,i was glad that this movie did without all the supposed depth of all too many pseudo serious interracial movies race was one issue yes but so was class and loyalty and honesty etc br br i also loved the idea that the love affair wasn't couched solely in the aspects of either character's appearance aren't our divorce courts on both sides of the atlantic i daresay filled now with enough couples who thought good together ' is all it takes to make a solid marriage in any case the tenderness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would have brought a rainbow to any dreary day in other words a light hearted movie that's by no means a light weight,1
1626,what an utter disappointment forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons peter cook is good as the british pm it lacks the biting satire of the original going instead for lowest common denominator slapstick 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people,0
1627,boogie nights is full of surprises nothing quite prepares one for it its soul yes it does have soul whilst tackling the tackiest of subject matter with both a wry smile and respect cast and wonderful character development the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style br br the plot proved richer than i expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each b grade human being is brought through crisis into perspective br br a dream case study the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self esteem parental love and lack of it attention love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood the desperate need to belong something for everyone here almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal br br the film works on a number of levels the ironic loop is that the milieu portrayed exists only because of the voyeur who happens to be watching the film br br boogie nights is non judgmental of its subject matter and characters a rarity it deserves every accolade it has achieved and more,1
1628,tom and jerry are transporting goods via airplane to africa but being white men they're worried they won't be safe so they put on blackface to fit in once they're wearing it they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters they crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft before reaching land they suffer the advances of an over affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks a swordfish and a whale once on land they're frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into a cave inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface and upon exiting the cave things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals br br plane dumb is an especially sloppy effort from van studios one example a lion unknown to tom and jerry enters the cave before they do but the animators must have forgotten about it because the lion never appears again another example is the ending that's not an ending it's just an arbitrary stop br br according to a youtube poster the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices and caricatures of a popular comedy team known as miller but aubrey died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed and co directors john foster george were forced to rework the animation into a 'tom jerry' story br br they shouldn't have bothered the crude animation and poorly executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end,0
1629,it was very sensitive very deep it's my favorite all the time you can't see movie more deeper than this incredible movie susan sarandon made her role as matured mind actress and she realized her role she deserved the award she convinced me with for being a nun the music was very impressive and sensitive really i liked this deep masterpiece,1
1630,this was such a great series for black folks at the time we loved it so much it was the only show about black middle class families on t v at the time please release this on dvd i know many many people who still talk about the show if it its released i am certain that many black youth will find this enlightening as well as interesting the show addressed many topics from racism race discrimination teen pregnancy sibling rivalry single parenting peer pressure and much more the show ended in such an abrupt way and left it's fans speechless and wondering why it was taken off the air since then we have only seen a few of the actors and actresses please release it on dvd asap,1
1631,we screened this movie in a club as an example of how classic literature can become twisted into some of the most awful movies of all time just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be set in the techno futile future should have been enough of a hint i think that word describes the movie itself because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie the effort was completely futile not to mention that our club advisor told us that it allegedly couldn't get a distributor for two years br br this cinematic failure is littered with cheesy cliche dialogue that's worse than angsty teen poetry beowulf's character changes halfway through in a way that is in no way credible and whenever he's in an action scene he's constantly flipping like a hyper gymnast there is even as they say a token black guy whose attempts at humor are completely out of place and of course the daughter of the leader of the outpost grendel is terrorizing is a total vixen a vixen whose breasts are exposed throughout the entire movie a vixen who wants to fight the creature yet she never puts on armor and her weapon of choice is a little carving knife and despite their dire situation she still dresses up for dinner in a dress with a see through skirt that exposes her short shorts underwear there are a couple scenes that could pass as soft core pornography and in the second scene they even reuse footage from the first i thought the portrayal of grendel was bad enough but then came the end of the film which featured a display of cgi that might be decent for the 80s but is totally ridiculous for a late 90s venture i could go on but you all should watch this film for the fully laughable effect yourselves br br the other club members and i did manage to have fun watching this by taking a cue from mst 3k and mocking it the whole way through i'm still reeling from an extra's weapon a perpetually spinning pizza cutter on a pole,0
1632,yet another gay film ruined by asinine politics final speech just about sent me running out of the theatre with its bumper sticker epigrams read the comic book it was based on for a much more entertaining experience,0
1633,according to me a movie can be best rated by the number of 'best scenes' there are there are probably at least 80 90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as 'best' by somebody or the other br br this movie is a masterpiece period i know many who have called it ahead of its time probably because it bombed at box office however i think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out br br i am personally glad that is part of the movie too his role isn't that however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest hindi movie ever,1
1634,with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made it's very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time br br i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the 'black' in jokes the up' look and the it's so incredible 'over the top' and so bad that is even past the 'so bad it's funny again' mark and have plummeted right into 'totally embarrassing for anyone br br i'm very very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one i want my time back br br save yourself the agony do not watch this the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn't an option,0
1635,the english translation of the title on the dvd version of this film is graveyard of horrors but i think that must be an error it should have been called graveyard of horrible acting horrible editing horrible story and horrible music all make this a horrible film best left in a horrible graveyard br br horrible,0
1636,wagons east is widely known as john candy's last movie as he died on the set that's just what makes it so sad not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie seriously i don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has no redeeming qualities it's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it no wonder john candy didn't want to make the movie maybe his contractual participation was what did him in br br anyway the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career to be certain he had already completed michael moore's canadian bacon in which the united states declares war on canada just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career honorably as for richard lewis who previous had co starred with candy in eugene absurd but hilarious once upon a crime he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on countdown with keith in later years,0
1637,jamie foxx leads a brilliant cast in this powerful voyage through the life of the blind emotionally troubled african american genius of pop jazz mr ray charles though the entire cast performs wonderfully mr foxx earned more than simply an oscar if it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years i would consider doing so for mr foxx foxx doesn't just play charles he re creates him cj sanders and sharon warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of ray's mother the inspiration of his life and young ray these two provided the strongest support in the film br br the dramas of charles' struggles with guilt the death of his younger brother and mother blindness discrimination addiction and success are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music the music is beautiful the script is as far as i can tell perfect and the acting is nothing short of legendary br br the directorial method of the film warrants discussion taylor a director i am generally ambivalent about had to choose what aspects of the larger than life and complex life story of mr charles would tell his story most honestly dramatically and understandably though some disagree seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic i believe he selected his themes admirably a big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in charles' life his profound love and respect for his mother his need to be loved and accepted his addiction and guilt complex his musical genius and his deep seated fear of responsibility for others charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons i learned more than i could have imagined about one of the men i used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his on sunday nights while football games were on the tv and nothing was sugar coated in ray the themes are carried forward with power and human dignity these themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life the power of these themes the strong script and directing the music and the acting make this one of the most enjoyable and evocative biographical films i have seen br br recommended for everyone,1
1638,in the 60's cleveland television audiences could watch a episode of flash gordon as part of the show 11 30pm friday this was the best material any of us in junior high had ever seen we would have regular sleepovers although we did not call them that just to get in on the fun of watching this stuff with a group of friends then the next week we would quote our favorite cornball lines from the latest episode br br watching it today provokes much the same reaction but if you can stop laughing at the dialogue the lame creatures the silly costumes and the horrible spaceships long enough there are some good things i did not appreciate the first time through the production designers built some excellent sets both the rooms and the laboratory devices charles ming the merciless character was the all time best screen villain certainly up to that time and arguable better than anyone since jean rogers is staggeringly beautiful br br then again what do i know i'm only a child,1
1639,i watched this film during a special advanced preview in reading br br the two main characters michael and rory strike up a friendship when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides michael is amazed to find someone who can finally understand him as until now his palsey made people think that he couldn't communicate br br rory introduces michael to the life that he's missing rory is a feisty character who doesn't let his condition muscular dystrophy get to him br br they bond and apply for independent living and find a lovely flat and assistant and have all the fun that they could ever dream of br br don't go to see this film if you are after some entertainment do go see this film if you're willing to see something a little different br br the storyline is strong the actors are fantastic and despite the sadness that comes with the film the mood is uplifting br br i thoroughly recommend it though if you are anything like me and prone to crying take tissues as you'll need them,1
1640,this was pretty bad pedestrian work or worse i don't think it was homophobic just really bad if anything it was really amateurish like when you're 14 and first discover curse words and skin mags br br the main point of this movie the romance falls really flat i can't help but wonder if the writers ever had any serious relationships before this movie br br plotting and pacing are horrible going nowhere at all one minute we're watching these guys catch cheaters then we're at a gay club then we're at a date out of nowhere the girl apparently likes comics and then they sleep together none of this feels real like an elementary school production of shakespeare if hamlet was written by a frat boy br br the ending was some kind of creepy over the top revenge fantasy by a loser who got dumped by a girl unnecessary and actually kind of disturbing br br still you have to watch it why br br as others noted the director's commentary actually is hilarious what kind of of professional talks about banging or hooking up with the actresses dialogue sucked relationships lacked chemistry you will be on the floor laughing at this pretentious jackass,0

1642,the plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind the violent clash between adolf hitler's germany and soviet russia from 1941 '45 br br with the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated and 20 to 30 million russian people killed the vibes of this conflict can be felt in russia up to the present day let alone back in 1957 when memories were still very fresh and painful br br this very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of beautiful shots its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war bravery love patriotism weakness cowardice and corruption all beautifully tied together by a toy squirrel br br add to this the truly magnificent acting and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous really one of the very best ever made br br,1
1643,for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family all of us hated it with a passion it's a nice enough kids' movie maybe in the year it came out however think about it an outdated kids' movie what's the point kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all br br some kids' movies like mary poppins or wizard of oz can be enjoyed even now but time bandits is totally outdated for your reference and i think applicable in this case i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all so if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies you might like time bandits br br there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys' think of the two stupid 'bad in the pirates of the c movies except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny br br anyway i warned you that's all i can do people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago if you have not seen it before then don't bother watching it now,0
1644,for an independent film it scores well with reasonably high production values and a great cast the acting is uneven but the plot is compelling we could have used a bit more development of wes ramsey's character but hey the guy's fun to look at nonetheless mary kay place and jacqueline bisset are like icing on the cake br br it's not surprising that it was controversial on its release it presents a less than flattering portrayal of the morman church and its relationship with gays while like brokeback mountain it's about tolerance and accepting one's own life i found it to be more successful in conveying a positive message it was more moving too,1
1645,saw this last night at the 7th annual nyc home film festival a rather tumultuous venue that quieted down for this sweet and touching two woman film br br the relationship between the two one older and blind the other a twenty something who helps her with her mail is established deftly and its depth is readily apparent br br there are no car chases explosions or mind boggling special effects just the sometimes difficult but rewarding task of humans reaching out toward each other to help and be helped br br see if it you can,1
1646,at the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the us are honestly bad this junk however portrays a heart warming side to a clothes horse acting laughably learnt with glances and phrases delivered in the i'm so important and thin and beautiful fashion in the episode i just sat through someone's job was at risk simply because a colleague had placed a phone call her capabilities off really this is the lowest of the low what kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses seeing only glitzy glam puss people parading around working utterly sick making when the titles rolled i thought oh well it provided jobs for the boys you know who you are,0
1647,this is by far probably the worst film al pacino could have starred in the movie had no real plot it kind of careens into 24 different directions it seems that the target audience for this film are people from anonymous mat mcconaughey's character is not believable enough to be pacino's so he won a few bets for some degenerate clients as a sideline to a shitty job recording on a 900 service does that automatically supposed to convince an audience of his skills it was just plain stupid to think of the trailer did promise to show us how he makes his sure shot picks but after going through the whole film i have yet to see what skill if any he ever had if you want skill try looking at robert de niro's character in casino now that is showmanship at some point in the film character picks his winning bets at a flip of a coin anybody could do that al pacino seems to talk a lot and i mean blabber mouth in your face dialog i think that style started with scent of a woman and worked for him because he finally won an oscar but now i think its just irritating he seems to be always sermonizing he does do a mean act of portraying a man having unstable that's an impending heart attack its typically reminiscent of his acting in part 3 which he plays the aging diabetic mafia don corleone but other than that pacino's talent is wasted on this film rene russo is just plain eye candy for this film she's kept in shape and shows it off in the tight clothes she wears throughout this film is plain crap do not waste your money on it it is much worse than the gambling picks of mats character in the film,0
1648,this is a fantastic film the acting is some of the best i've seen is obviously very beautiful and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting the the cinematography was extremely ahead of its time watching it i could see parallels of cinematography used today this is truly a groundbreaking film because of the cinematography and acting the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes it's a very touching and powerful piece my friend told me it was must see and i definitely agree with her this is one of those films that you watch and never forget everyone should see this intensely moving film this should be put on everyone's movies to see before whatever list,1
1649,it starts really interesting the story develops around the main character who runs a cleaning business specialized in cleaning up crime scenes as a former cop he runs into some strange situation when one job does suddenly vanish furthermore he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption his columbo feeling is justified the deeper he gets into the background of the story the good actors jackson ed harris eva mendes play in an suspenseful story with some twists but only up to the last 25 minutes up to here 7 of 10 stars spoiler suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot out involving the 14 year old daughter a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development why not having giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship or having the daughter discovering some facts or many possible much better story finishes are imaginable a truly wasted ending,0
1650,a march 1947 new york times article described crossfire as one of the first hollywood films of the 1940s to face questions of racial and religious prejudice with more forthright courage than audiences have been accustomed to expect while rko was producing crossfire twentieth century fox was making gentleman's agreement another story about rko raced to beat the much ballyhooed fox picture to the theaters releasing crossfire several months before gentleman's agreement in july 1947 rko screened crossfire for representatives of various los angeles religious groups in addition several surveys which were designed to gauge the audience's prejudices were conducted before and after screenings of the film crossfire received both praise and criticism for its depiction of in america and was the subject of many crossfire received an academy award nomination for best picture but lost to gentleman's agreement it was also nominated for best supporting actor robert ryan best supporting actress gloria grahame best director and best screenplay adaptation in september 1947 crossfire was named best social film at cannes in december 1947 ebony magazine an african american publication gave the film its annual award for improving interracial understanding loved this movie if you get the chance to watch it see it,1
1651,i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re released on dvd before you purchase them that way you could save yourself some time money and a certain degree of when you feel so utterly let down br br the buddy holly story is such a movie br br i do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching it br br i had recorded it on the old beta machine back in the early 1980s and liked it so much that it became a regularly played favourite the best part to my mind was gary busey's performance as the young buddy and his near perfect vocals and guitar playing br br i looked forward to the day when i could have it in stereo and that is where the disappointment comes in br br this dvd version is supposedly re mastered in both audio and video according to the shell information but i'm afraid it left me sadly let down and glancing at my watch wishing for it to end br br the sound is murky bordering on the unintelligible and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal clarity vocals of my old beta tape br br despite what you think of the images or the plot or the characters the real draw card here is the music and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the or the backing harmonies or other then there's not much left is there br br i'm going to convert my old beta version to mono dvd for subsequent viewings and put this one where it belongs out with the rubbish br br extinction is the rule survival is the exception,0
1652,aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence this painful film is most notable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours br br it starts with an interminably long intro where the family is introduced including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister completely clichéd pa and ma and incredibly annoying grandpa played by charles chic sales while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of gunfire and rushes to the window in time to see two men gunned down by mobsters in the street the mobsters flee through the family's house leaving them as witnesses to the crime br br the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the crusading da occasionally interrupting long anti crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob it all winds up in a predictable manner br br good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a truly nasty beating nat pendleton as one of the mobsters and the gorgeous sue blane in a small role as the daughter br br if you want to watch huston play his early trademark crusading lawman try 1932's beast of the city avoid this one if at all possible,0
1653,the true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known led the game of football out of the stone age with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts but he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches along the way he brought fame and glory to a tiny little unknown catholic school in indiana pat o'brien is incomparable in his role as terrific cast that includes ronald reagan who gives a great performance as notre first true superstar george br br for football aficionados this is the greatest football movie ever made do yourself a favor and rent the black and white version some versions have deleted scenes for some reason if you got the good version look for a brief cameo by the immortal jim as he sticks his head in the locker room telling and the team they only have a few minutes left before the 2nd half begins,1
1654,two years after ' took off jim abrahams jerry and david zucker cast one of its stars leslie nielsen in this hilarious television series a glorious take off of old u s detective shows such as nielsen played frank america's answer to it had the same style of humour as ' clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as johnny the shoe shine boy who seems to know everything about everything guest stars including william shatner were killed off in the opening credits 'police was the first u s sitcom since 'batman' to lack a laugh track many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but i think it was about right the concept could never have sustained a full 24 episode run five years later 'police made a successful transfer to the big screen when the first of the 'naked gun' trilogy was released jim jerry david and leslie had the last laugh,1
1655,this is one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire b movies br br calvin klein underwear model oh i mean stefan the good vampire returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty but manicure impaired and eternally drooling half brother has other plans having killed their father the vampire king now sets his sights on stefan stefan's new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends and the all powerful br br okay the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot on location in fricken for gosh sakes the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker but who cares there's only one reason to watch this movie and his name is he's a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film as slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning slobbering face for the world to see i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother but maybe i'm just a sicko questionable taste in men aside i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts it's original it's fun and is one of the best vampires i've seen in a long time much more fun than the stiff tragic whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days enjoys his sadism and never apologizes he's what a vampire should be,1
1656,this movie is a shameful result of what happens when br br a it is written directed and produced by an idiot and or b it was rushed in production to satiate the poker stu ungar craze br br the story from beginning is uneven spends too much time on childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales such as counting cards his blackjack escapades the roll of money as id he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese etc the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end br br if you want a more complete and accurate account read the book one of a kind if you thought the movie was good read the book and change your mind,0
1657,i've been strangely attracted to this film since i saw it on showtime sometime in the early 80's i say strangely because it is rather a ludicrous bit of soft core fluff a genre i'm not particularly interested in the dialogue is and philosophical making sense no doubt only to it's franco italian producers and the plot completely extraneous what it does achieve is a wonderfully hypnotic and thoroughly pleasant mood the scenery the beautiful philippines soft focus nudity and wonderful score all contribute to a strange and extremely watchable exercise in a sort of film making seldom seen today it is truly one of my great guilty pleasures i was fortunate enough to find it on an old laserdisc and have watched it more times than i think is healthy a worthwhile,1
1658,this is quite possibly the worst sequel ever made the script is unfunny and the acting stinks the exact opposite of the original,0
1659,a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by wolf blood into a meek quiet but very large gardener in order to prove an hypothesis so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature island of dr moreau frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated goofy morality play br br though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best this film is not too poorly made and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time like most mad scientist films this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway the acting is passable as is the cinematography and the film moves along at an entertaining clip some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous but hey it's just a movie and a b minus one at that there are also a few nice shots of a wolf and a smattering of humor tossed in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously always a plus for this genre,0
1660,some friends recommended this but as a film it's really lacking in originality i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning however if you like traditional english appalachian ballads it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie with professional musicians filling in for the actors,0
1661,what's fun about barker's is that it's the story of a human on a rampage a deadly threat to monsters everywhere in this one the monsters the night breed of the title are the good guys it shares its sense of celebrating the different the twisted and the dark with the first addams family movie and much of tim burton's work it also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by barker br br especially fun is the performance by cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the as happens in most classic monster movies the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks only this time the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic weapons with guns and bombs and this time the sympathy you felt when you saw frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie br br this isn't a masterpiece and even barker has done more interesting and certainly more chilling work but it's pure fun it looks great and remains light without mocking itself worth a look,1
1662,quality entertainment all around the spectacle of kermit on his bicycle is one thats as memorable as any in cinema history there's just not a bad thing to be said tons of muppets great cameos slapstick puns whatever you want its here the lovers the dreamers and me indeed,1
1663,did you ever see the film marathon man the part with the dentist i would rather have that happen to me than to sit through random hearts again it wasn't simply uninteresting or uneventful it was horribly painfully and agonizingly boring at one point i momentarily lost conciousness to the average layman i may have appeared to be sleeping but the other movie patrons knowingly realized i actually blacked out from the i thought i was going to die when the film finally ended i think it was twelve hours long but i'm not sure i let out an thank you jesus it's over to which all other movie goers cheered if i had to listen to harrison ford drone on one more second in that monotoned whine i would have been forced to search for something sharp to jam in my eye to divert my attention this is 136 minutes of my life i will never get back,0
1664,okay i'll admit right up front that the cartoons made by loony tunes are pretty offensive and i can understand why warner brothers has pulled them off the market seen today the huge lipped and very stereotypical is not politically correct however the cartoons were well made and it's a shame they aren't released with some sort of explanatory prologue such as the one with leonard maltin they included with some recent politically incorrect donald duck cartoons that were recently released on dvd in other words throwing out the cartoons completely is to forget our history plus little black and other racist cartoons are out there especially on the internet br br this cartoon has our little hero out hunting at first he's chasing a cute little caterpillar but later accidentally happens upon a lion a lion that is more than happy to make his dinner however through all this a weird appears again and again and eventually you'll see why this bird is so important to the story br br cute well made and clever i like the cartoons plus i take pleasure in showing them to extremely thin skinned liberal friends just to watch them have apoplectic fits or even heart attacks loads of fun folks,1
1665,every time i've seen this movie i get the same impression some parts of it are so amazingly stupid bad that they crack me up they aren't intentional and there are a lot of them the rest is just plain bad stupid and or irrelevant a movie like evil dead gets credit for being bad at it's own expense because it's the intended result it' stupid and cheesy because sam raimi succeeded at what he was trying to do this movie doesn't have that excuse it's stupid and cheesy because the filmmakers failed so miserably the crap result gets heaped on top of the crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can be given is one for ' watching this movie has the same effect as listening to a billy madison essay everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i should be able to give this movie something around a 5,0
1666,i just caught wild rebels on one of the mystery science theatre 3000 archive compilations and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn't make it entertaining there are some mst3k targets that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn't possibly have been good movies like the green slime and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn't them in the execution wild rebels is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier when don siegel directed his remake of the killers at universal both films are about a failed racing driver who's seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman's boyfriend only in the killers the driver was john cassavetes the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was ronald reagan steve bobbie byers and willie are quite a comedown but what really makes wild rebels an awful movie is the direction by william note the accent over the final e present in his on screen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point it's only a pity that someone didn't do a mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between steve hairdo and rod would have been irresistible,0
1667,this movie i watched back in 1981 when it came out although i missed the first part of the movie what i did see was great this movie is hard to find but if found you must see the acting is great very believable sad movie if i ever find me a copy i definitely will buy me a copy to treasure,1
1668,i'm slowly ploughing through as many hong kong action films as i can get my hands on and came across this gem mainly due to ching wan lau who is one of my favourite actors br br its a great action film although not as ott as the title might suggest it moves along at a great pace and is truly enjoyable br br the biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack it would appear that rob the guy who did the to death' song which was popular in 'the matrix' has lifted the soundtrack from big bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his angels' album the tune in question is called 'im not driving anymore' and is also the opening tune for the tv series 'law and order' and the opening track on the reloaded' dvd menu teaser that really surprised me due to the sheer,1

1670,well for a start i must say that here in russia a saga of of is known and loved a gifted writer or maybe even genius of some sort created one of the most realistic honest cynical and god d mn well written fantasy worlds in a history of literature and when such amazing material gets in a right hands well see rpg game and you will understand what i am talking about br br is an excellent example of the opposite outcome br br lack of budget lack of directing lack of good script br br these three whales of disgusting movie making sunken this movie ate it alive acting is good sometimes even more than good but for god sake it can not save this project br br i still have some faith though i still hope that someday a new movies will be created and entire world will see magnitude and breathtaking splendor of books p s but before that a uwe boll must be eliminated just in case you know,0
1671,if you watched the series and love the league as i do then prepare to be disappointed i went to the cinema with a group of die hard league fans and we were all in agreement that this film wasn't as funny or dark as the three series before in my personal opinion it was a money spinner the writing was contrived and the plot confused no not confusing just confused with what it was trying to do it was self indulgence of the worst kind from writers who are far more talented than my pitiful criticisms i hope the league at least can be honest enough with themselves and acknowledge this film as being inferior to the superb three series i will not be buying it despite owning most of the league memorabilia,0
1672,oh my god it just doesn't get any worse than this i always love silly little sci fi b movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released what were these people thinking they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do the acting and the not so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b movies and what is with the men dressed up as women could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing no probably not br br i would give this a 0 if possible it does not even deserve a 1 for awful do not waste your time and especially not your money on this horrible loser of a non film,0
1673,i was hoping this would be of the calibre of das boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed german director leni riefenstahl in her documentaries sadly i was monumentally disappointed the story line is implausible and defies credulity an raf airman is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in dresden anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the airman and they make love the next evening at a lavish engagement party the airman turns up disguised as a german officer and dances with anna although well directed and acted to me it is soap opera of the lowest order,0
1674,it's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore thought this movie was a good thriller br br could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists i had real reservations before seeing this movie because of the cover i was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory i was wrong br br although there is a lot of scary parts there is a lot of suspense and drama too br br the acting in dead line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick the characters were believable br br the movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll br br because of its production values the sound is not very good for example 8 10,1

1676,brainy cross dressing little boy finds success on the spelling bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing shirley maclaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long time actors getting their chance at directing a film the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with here the only person well cast in bruno is maclaine the child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness and squishy hearted maclaine holds their close ups for excruciatingly long periods nothing about these cherubs seems natural not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other as the boy's disgruntled father poor gary sinise hovers around the edges in mock shame always with a pained look on his face towards the end of the film maclaine turns the whole thing into a of hugging scenes and even concludes with the kid hugging the pope in rome another ungodly treatise from a talented actress turned director who much like sally field and her film beautiful cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childhood innocence as a punchline the children in this cast roll their eyes crack wise with mature comments use big words but when one mealy mouthed boy calls our pint sized hero gay maclaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out in front the media how's that for progression from,0
1677,a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments but does very little else a perfunctory thriller plot which is there merely to string the club sequences together variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script all stop sorted from being the showcase that director obviously intended br br however although is sometimes over indulgent especially when using the often ill fitting dance music he does show potential and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing overall however the film is a wasted opportunity and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere watchable nevertheless,0
1678,if all movies had to be destroyed and only one could be spared death in venice would have to be it it is a monument in movie history much criticized for being slow boring and too obvious in stating it's point an old man discovers beauty in a young boy and is tragically destroyed first mentally then physically we should appreciate this movie for what it is a was shot over 30 years ago and it portrays a period even further back at the beginning of the twentieth century br br life was slow then compared to now people were supposed to behave in a certain way hiding their true emotions even from themselves director visconti and dirk bogarde the leading actor admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer von discovers his romantic interest in a young boy for a man like von in his time this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with we see his inner struggle mostly on the face of bogarde against the beautiful backdrop of venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music composed by gustav br br this movie is slow there is no denying it no special effects car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats no perverted sex scenes either the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile br br so basically nothing much happens in this movie not if you want your senses to be hit like a base drum if you want them to be played like the strings of a violin in a romantic concerto this is the movie to do it,1
1679,interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno's replacing carson as host of the tonight show film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o'brien and jay leno br br the film does a good job of sparking viewers' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the particularly of the nbc executives the portrayal of was particularly compelling and interesting i thought br br still many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon and some of the acting seemed perfunctory nevertheless an interesting story,0
1680,undercurrent features a top notch cast of wonderful actors who might've been assembled for the perfect drawing room comedy alas they are pretty much wasted on a view' potboiler and a paper thin one at that katharine hepburn is indeed radiant as a tomboy old maid who finally marries but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring dark family secrets director vincente minnelli has absolutely no idea how to mount this outlandish plot concocted by edward from a story by thelma and the friendly first rate cast including robert taylor robert mitchum and edmund gwenn is left treading in murky waters from,0
1681,very poor script and acting i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new all is in the cliché of the mentor and the talented immature pupil the characters even interesting nor sympathetic artistically it is as empty and insignificant the colours are very impersonal and light only the poster may be appealing al pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate but i can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time,0
1682,i've seen three of the animatrix episodes and this is my favorite of all of them the second renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe program was a stylistically impressive number it just felt kind of silly i guess what gives this one it's special touch is the direction from watanabe director of the incredibly popular and for good reason series cowboy bebop it has some of the best elements of bebop slick sci fi adventure a no nonsense slightly apathetic hero working for hire a bounty head more or less and a chase scene all wrapped up in an excellent film noir packaging watanabe's tarantino style slickness comes through here full throttle,1
1683,you have to see this movie it's a big footnote in the history of film when this film was made american film industry reached the bottom of sucking see this movie laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life it's the worst acting i've seen and even worse directing the villains laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did scary movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake called black scorpion iii the threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide,0
1684,keys to the vip an original series by the canadian comedy network ca scored big with this entertaining yet inspirational gameshow this show is hosted by four funny good looking guys who judge others on their ability to pick up women each episode features two guys who go head to head in various pick up games there are three different sections and the winner scores a night as a vip in an exclusive toronto night club br br being a guy i naturally find this show hilarious we all know that it's hard to confront women and watching these guys do it naturally sparks the curiosity of men the guys who compete on this show might even give you a few pointers if you pay attention,1
1685,this is one of the films that killed the spaghetti western it not only loses something in the translation it is a total chaotic mess of editing as well either chunks of it have been edited out and or re edited for an english language version in any case it makes little or no sense period it makes the trinity and the eastwood man with no name films look like john ford john wayne by comparison nothing in this film is original somewhere in there is a beginning a middle and finally an end except for the end not everything is exactly in that order robert wood seems personable enough the rest of the cast especially the women should have made better career choices,0
1686,everybody seems to compare this to the matrix and the 13th floor and when i first saw it i would have agreed i was expecting the matrix and was a little disappointed but upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely br br the thing to keep in mind is that the matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in the 13th floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo thrown in is not an action movie at all and is not as many seem to believe about reality or any such deep concept it's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial both in its origin and in its behavior world of make believe br br the most chilling moment in the movie is when geller repeats her scripted line it's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story this is made even more frightening at the end when d'arcy nader or rather his player comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game i sympathize completely with the realist philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence living in the game is not living at all but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth as comments about the real world there's nothing going on here might as well jack into someone else's imagination and pretend to be doing something interesting although i have to ask whether cronenberg considers this a self indictment considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets br br upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie i thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended but having seen it a couple more times thank you scifi channel i've realized how much deeper it goes seriously if you've only seen it once it deserves another viewing,1
1687,for a movie shot in 18 days and a budget less than 2 million this little movie that could deserves a 'best we award interesting premise aside from the usual meteor stuff with solid by a cast of familiar faces 2 thumbs up advice to the other reviewer don't be afraid to say you liked something,1
1688,pretty lousy made for tv sequel to the roman polanski classic rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie after eliminating rosemary here played by patty duke a coven of witches again led by minnie roman preps satan's son for world domination it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor instead writer anthony wilson and director sam o'steen opt for a satan worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting plenty of candles and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time gordon's the sole from the original george replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman subbing for the late sidney newcomer mchattie is the film's only real saving grace he's very off kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy but so over used it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective o'steen who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever,0
1689,it is playing on showtime right now but is going to be released as a movie called three or has been released for 2006 mess ups include a supposed nude body comes out of the waves with her bottoms on you can have fun finding the others it was a decent stranded hungry cold crazy person video but that is about it and of course what would a movie be without sex the lady has a nice body and the men are pretty but the story is the same as swept away or a savage is loose type with some blood wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as three billy zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely juan di pace is awesome and there is a couple good sex scenes there is a voodoo woman that loves the character di pace plays and in real life her name is di pace too not aware of any connection but probably kin or married,0
1690,the debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured if limited stab at the con game and obsession filmed for zero money nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of london to ply his trade given the lack of funds this short 67 min is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom though the initial set up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept the muddy cinematography he often used natural lighting due to budget can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization though the limitations do show at times br br one can easily see nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in memento and insomnia not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and nolan fans,1
1691,this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people two of whom join the movement and blah blah it is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the peasants and and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop literally as we don't hear the villagers say a word never mind learn anyone's name thus they occupy the same 'role' as the in old hollywood films the movie is also dull and the story does not actually get us anywhere except to various bedrooms we are apparently supposed to admire the of it all which merely means no good song and dance routine which would not have saved the film of course but might have at least the boredom br br my friend was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing,0
1692,an rko short subject br br a group of rowdy little bullies are given a lesson in tolerance by crooner frank sinatra who compares america to the house i live in br br this little film delivers a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice bias sinatra is an absolute natural in front of the camera intense sincere he is the perfect spokesperson for the values espoused here br br sinatra sings the house i live in ' by lewis allan earl robinson this fine tune with a solid pro american message is being given something of a comeback since the horrendous events of september 11 2001 br br after pearl harbor hollywood went to war totally against the axis not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service but the output of the studios was largely turned to the war effort the newsreels of course brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week the features showcased battle stories or war related themes even the short subjects cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading allied propaganda the boosting of morale or information dissemination together uncle sam the american people hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination,1
1693,when i first saw that this movie was going to be playing on tv i only new of pauly shore as this joke of a comedian who wore really weird outfits back in the day i still decided to watch it and i was impressed shore brings a fresh breath of air to the screen in this movie he plays crawl a college adviser that probably needs his own adviser as well carla in an underrated role plays a midwestern farm girl with a simple family and a movie cliché boyfriend travis when she heads off to ucla she meets crawl and he quickly turns her into a bubbly blonde californian girl she decides to bring crawl home for the thanksgiving break when travis decides to propose needs a distraction crawl then decides to make everyone believe that him and are engaged already this leads to crawl spicing up the romance between parents befriending her brother and even getting the dancers at the local bar to get a little loose i'm not going to reveal the end but i liked it anyway don't rent it if you want a poignant performance rent it if you want to laugh your butt of and enjoy an often missed part of 90's humor,1
1694,it is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed the dialogue was so bad it was sickening the train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students lou diamond phillips must have hidden under his seat when this this movie was shown at a private screening he most likely left by the back door the only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast they had to bite the bullet to get through this one i couldn't stand to watch all of it it was so predictable that it was funny who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy,0
1695,another 'good overcoming evil' story but with a difference this includes learning self discipline when julie goes with her teacher to a zen monastery she learns about herself she also her karate skills br br when the zen monks visit the city some awkward and comical moments ensue not uproarious but entertaining nonetheless br br next karate kid has much to say about looking within and improving what is there as well as using what you have,1
1696,in my work with the only nationwide non profit organization security on campus inc dedicated exclusively to the issue of college campus crime prevention and student awareness i see all too often the type of campus violence and cover up' through secret campus courts portrayed in the movie silencing mary ' in fact we receive numerous calls and requests for information every month from campus reporters such as mary' who are facing similar situations br br its depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by mary ' the victim's roommate and a student journalist played exceedingly well by melissa joan hart for justice was very well done and accurately researched br br this was the first television movie that i have ever seen that i felt truly reflected and encompassed all of the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses although it would not be possible to address all of these issues in depth in 2 hours this movie comes closer than any others i've seen,1
1697,alright i'm 12 so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre teen's point of view i've also commented on magnolia and man both great movies if you want to check it out alright here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images very pleasing to the eye the writer i don't know who it was check imdb either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love poetry and drama i cried 4 times throughout this movie once for over 30 minutes it was really sad really beautiful really meaningful it's a great movie for anyone say 11 and up who isn't a romantic comedy freak yeah it's romantic yeah it's comedic but in my opinion it's better than she's all that or whatever it takes i never cry it's a tender story go rent it and tape it,1
1698,you've seen the same tired worn out clichéd sit com stories characters stories 1000's of times this excels at sucking more than others first and foremost there isn't a single character in this show that's even remotely likable in particular michael dave gold is by far one of the biggest asses ever to grace a television screen ever repugnant comes to mind if in real life a father was this unlikable cruel and just generally unfit to parent would be your only option to call the remaining characters stereotypes would be too complementary if these characters ended up on life support the line to pull the plug would be light years long how this show finished one complete season much less 2 is a mystery fox cancels arrested development and keeps this on the air you tell me the terrorists aren't winning,0
1699,i've seen lonesome dove dead man's walk and the streets of and now the return to lonesome dove if you are hungry for more after watching lonesome dove this'll fill yer belly great cast great story most definitely a close second to lonesome dove i will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection this is the best or at least my favorite performance by jon voight he is captain call lou gossett jr playing pickett is not somebody i'd mess with he is a bad ass with perspective william peterson does a great job as well rick schroder is back as newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on nypd blue my only problem with this film and it's really picking nits is that i had the impression that call wanted to be the first man to cattle in montana and it's obvious that had already been there a while a little inconsistent but easily overlooked as you lose yourself in the fantastic tale i especially love the apparent character growth of jasper and july johnson i've watched this movie several times and am ready for another sequel,1
1700,i've heard a lot about porno holocaust and its twin film erotic nights of the living dead both films are interchangeable and were filmed at the same time on the same location with the same actors changing clothes for each film and taking them off if you are expecting the d'amato genius displayed in films like omega or death smiles on murder you won't find it here nonetheless this film has a charm that exploitation fans will not be able to resist where else will you see hardcore sex mixed with a zombie monster and his enormous penis that strangles and chokes women to death only from d'amato there is some amount of gore in which many of the men are bludgeoned to death the film is set on a beautiful tropical island as far as i know there is no subtitled version so if you don't speak italian you wont know what is going on but who cares right in all honesty gore fans will probably fast forward through the hardcore sex and if anyone is actually watching this for the sex only will for sure be offended instantly i can just imagine modern day porn fans tracing back through d'amato's output and coming across this atrocity out of the two i find erotic nights of the living dead far superior but don't bother watching either if they are cut porno holocaust is extremely low budget as expected even the monster looks no where as good as george eastman's character in anthropophagus the film is worth watching for laughs and to complete your d'amato film quest,1
1701,of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera wellman could break your heart quicker than anyone even ford but this is one of his worst even he seemed to know it probably from its jejune treatment not much above a bonanza or big valley br br yet there is one moment typical wellman that comes out of nowhere to shatter you the death of the indian wife of gable she has gone to give her baby some water and wham is killed by an arrow instantly no warning nada br br one of the most shocking unprepared for deaths in all cinema particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy western of course the treatment of her afterwards is laden with total indifference apparently to the film even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best,0
1702,i've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world it took me 3 efforts to watch this movie the first time i fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom possibly because i was already tired as it was late at night the second effort i managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again i found myself asleep i can go on and on like this but i think you're getting the point nothing happens ever in this movie a complete waste of time and money this movie really sucks watch it and you will know what i am talking about if you can get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all then you are indeed a masochist the only reason i gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option i just thought the world needed to be warned before either hiring or worse yet buying this trash later,0
1703,i like 50s sci fi movies a lot i like the really good ones such as the day the earth stood still when worlds collide invasion of the body snatchers and many others and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends such as plan 9 from outer space however when a sci fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun it really should be avoided this movie is just such a film the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she beast is attacking mankind whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting a woman is married to a womanizer she is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it also many of the special effects really stink especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby,0
1704,it's as if the editor and screenwriter only had 40 minutes of real running time this is supposed to be a remake of a chinese film which is obviously far superior to this trash it's clear that some brainless hollywood suit or writer decided that this movie would be mano a mano man against man instead of just letting the story play out with the personalities of the characters that were built in the first 40 minutes at this point in the film the characters just don't act like regular people and not even like their own personalities it makes little sense it's quite clear why this film flopped it's just not believable at all and that's too bad it started out with promise don't be fooled,0
1705,doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before on about its supposed revelations ask yourself a question is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb shelter mentality of com before you waste your time with this screed br br these sorts of mother earth people's republic of berkeley that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one pathetic br br don't be a sap take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more 'end of the world' hysteria from it takes a village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own mi moore rather his unthinking followers have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one sided political trash passed off as a cough documentary but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever gullible public if it's on a movie screen it must be true br br god gave you a brain act like you know what you're supposed to do with it,0
1706,this feeble attempt at veering your typically bland japanese horror movie more towards a creepy cult hit did not have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved throughout translated to vortex is about just that an irrational and tribute to the strange downward spiral into nothingness that has seemingly captivated a whole small town into dementia obsessed lunatics while this certainly makes for a pleasurable b movie on the surface the traditionally tiresome acting direction and script will have all but asian horror buffs shaking their heads in dismay what could have roughly translated into japanese equivalent of an early david lynch piece instead wares out it's spiraled gimmickry before it even has a chance to explain itself which of course it does not aside from a few clever techniques employed the movie rarely connects the dizzying thematics with the dull script ultimately coming across as a cheap exploitation into the cult genre substituting hollow imagery for genuine substance when the movie had ended there was hardly anything that was gained from any of the interactions save a tiny few scenes or images that rose above the one note film i do applaud the makers for at least trying to take the genre into more supernatural metaphysical realms and understand the rough losses lost in translation but with zero substance to back any of it's up this will likely be relegated to obscure fanboy's bong ridden basements,0
1707,i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless but don't get me wrong delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for law kidman and zellweger even though portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film the locations are beautiful and has an eye for a good shot br br however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to and his adaptation the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally invest or hadn't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable overall the cold mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all i remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters,1
1708,unbelievable great cast fair acting interesting plot br br but this movie has such graphic cruelties that are not tense or giving thrills just pure disturbing br br spoiler br br everyone could see coming the freak returns to his habits and that robert englund was acting was he like an idiot forbidding your daughter to sleep with a football player but him trying to kill an idiot and liking is alright br br the policeman who's daughter was kidnapped anyone felt he was a cop and not an actor not me this movie drags on and on with an ending that we see in other horror movies if the returns were alright a part 2 could be made bad really bad stuff might give creeps some inspiration,0
1709,this film offers one of the greatest experiences available to movie goers it is by no means a pleasant film but offers realities and emotions the human mind may never have meant to touch upon it opens pathways in how an individual thinks and afterwards will change the person forever br br the first time i saw this film was in class and immediately after seeing it i had to skip my next class and walk around campus in order to reset my body and mind i felt devastated and somehow unreal as if i didn't exist it was only a few months later that i was telling one of my friends about shame and she asked oh is that when you were messed up after seeing it and ran into me talking all strange about it i didn't even remember running into or talking to anyone at all while outside that day i was astonished br br in plot terms it is the simple tale of a couple torn apart by war there suffering is greater than that of the dead and by the end there are no words to complete the image that bergman creates its like a horrible dream which causes you to wake altering your own reality forever this film must be seen,1
1710,i'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy i've been waiting for it on dvd i've got it on vhs and got so fed up waiting for a release and worrying that my vhs copy would ruin i got the equipment to get it onto dvd the picture and sound are excellent to my utter surprise if anyone else want's a copy drop me a line at br br stone stew yahoo co uk br br and for £7 00 i'll put it onto a dvd print the dvd and get it in the post to you £7 00 just covers my costs recorded delivery etc with maybe a little over so i'm not after making money out of it i'd just like the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy i recently saw a copy of ebay got for over amazing how can they not release this classic email me for payment details like cheque or paypal etc etc,1
1711,the basic idea for this movie was good but there was no real character development and the pacing was slow maybe because i saw it in a sloppily edited pan scanned video version it went straight to video in france,0
1712,1 stephen baldwin doesn't care about his involvement in stephen baldwin vehicles br br 2 the acting in any stephen baldwin vehicle ranges from horrible to mildly passable br br 3 writers don't write stephen baldwin vehicles children do br br 4 most of the stephen baldwin vehicles revolve around one genre the actionless action genre it basically consists of crappy action sequences made with little to no effort whatsoever br br 5 the director doesn't care about stephen baldwin vehicles he passes his job to an orangutan from time to time br br and now you know,0
1713,i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election cbs's last shot at throwing a dig at bush this movie was just awful yet i'm still watching it minor spoiler i think cbs got the same people who provided the to do the semi cut in half sequence what is with the bad boyfriend storyline can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a ed wood movie who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing if you want to see decent b grade disaster movies then see earthquake flood etc avoid this mess of a movie hint to cbs avoid showing us this crap give us re runs of csi instead better acting and more believable,0
1714,this movie was not very good in my opinion while not a complete waste of an hour and a half luckily i didn't have to pay for it it just wasn't very scary there were parts where i jumped and a few minimally violent gory scenes but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scary br br the overall writing and acting were very weak the characters never evolved or grew as people even at the end the lead guy whatever his name was didn't man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute the plot also had inconsistencies the police officer who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game the girl october mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape the malcolm in the middle kid died in the game but didn't die in real life also making the game play by itself was very weak writing it would have been okay for the brother's death just to get them playing again but you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again why do you even need the game if you like movies like the ring and thing its scary and fun watch this movie if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at do it if you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free do it otherwise stay far far away,0
1715,i remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of suspense and twists it grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie i have thought about this movie for the past several years and have checked in video stores to see if it's available but was never able to find it or anyone who had even heard of it i think this type of movie is timeless and i know it would be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie watchers i hope this gets on video soon as it would be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did back in the early 70's br br it's very rare that a tv movie can make that much of an impression but this was did and still does after so many years,1
1716,i think my summary says it all this mtv ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x or is that gen y type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations example kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his wedding kennedy is the bride done up in a full bridal gown and long wig the joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces problem is this schtick goes on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking do i look fat i recognize the show was not made for me it was made for 12 year old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show was short lived,0
1717,i am sure i'm in the minority i know i am among my friends but i found this movie long boring and gratuitous the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character the only other time i liked him at all was in a bug's life speaks volumes rene russo's character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical to say he was two dimensional may be a little generous no the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real br br with the exception of two wonderful scenes both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf,0
1718,a group of evil businessmen need to knock down a building to build a huge complex but they can't remove the tenants the tenants and businessmen with their hired thugs clash until the film ends with one of the funniest fights ever the guy with the ginger hair who goes every time he throws a punch and the other guy who poses with a knife in his mouth instead of fighting only to be beaten off camera make this essential viewing if you like to laugh at films rather than with them,1
1719,richard a very wealthy man has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral included in the funeral party is youngest sister cora while none of the family has seen cora in at least 20 years they all agree that cora was always a bit different so when cora says something about having been murdered most laugh it off as one of eccentricities but someone is obviously taking cora seriously the next day cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently is there a connection between the two deaths it's up to hercule poirot to find a killer br br after the funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire poirot series i've always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to christie's source material as any of the poirot installments the mystery is top notch with plenty of clues suspects and red herrings and as i've written before i always enjoy an christie story where hercule poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal it might be old fashioned but that's the way i like it getting beyond the plot technically and artistically after the funeral is a winner sets editing direction and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies the acting is equally impressive i've come to expect an enjoyable performance from david suchet as poirot and he doesn't disappoint here the rest of the cast is just as strong with monica dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced i've got no real complaints it's a good show all the way around,1
1720,they made me a criminal is a remake of an earlier warner brothers film the life of jimmy dolan which starred douglas fairbanks jr as the prizefighter on the lam br br even with the restrictions now upon production by the hays office this remake actually turns out to be better than the original douglas fairbanks jr is horribly miscast as a pugilist john garfield with his background and style steps into a part he was born to play br br they made me a criminal was directed by busby berkeley who jack warner believed in keeping busy in between musicals berkeley in fact would soon be leaving warner brothers for mgm br br berkeley does do a fine job here keeping the action flowing at a good pace i particularly like the scene where four of the dead end kids and garfield are swimming in a water tank and get stranded there when the water level goes down they get it out of it quite narrowly and with some good ingenuity br br other performances besides garfield and the kids to remember are may robson who runs the summer camp for the kids and claude rains as the obsessed detective on garfield's trail,1
1721,this is my favourite indian movie of all time it is comic genius salman khan is hilarious but amir khan steals the show with his witty dialogue karisma kapoor's outfits tell a story of their own makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier at one point she looks like she's wearing a nappy is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end there is not one dull moment every scene is hilarious even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter i especially loved the scene in which amar amir khan his i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a a a it is not a replicate of a hollywood movie thank god overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi urdu and loves good comedy br br watch it you'll love it,1
1722,another day this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it i thoroughly enjoy watching and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian mcmahon and appeared together following the roles they played in charmed i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film even the directing but the plot what happened i am at a loss for words because i am still confused i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot madness i would still watch it over and over again,0
1723,i bought this a while back during a massive martial arts movie phase although this certainly ain't the best i do love this kind of film making and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one leung kar yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars i always appreciate the fact that whilst he lacked formal martial arts training he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance he also has a good beard this movie has him in a good heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies he still acquits himself well early appearances from cherie chung and chow yun fat are also nice too see especially for the fact that chow yun fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play he may not be a great fighter but he does ok eddy ko is as great a bad guy as ever he performs the same as in many of his other films and does it great as per usual the fellow who plays bu is good too i don't recall his name but he's in magnificent butcher too although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era the postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance there are some very nifty scenes good characters and a good eclectic mixture of hong kong talents all coming together to decent effect all in all i would recommend this to kung fu and general hong kong action fans it may not be a stylised classic like the shaw brothers films or as crowd pleasing as jackie chan or bruce lee but it is rock solid entertainment,1
1724,the animation quality here is decidedly below par imo regardless of the age of the oav the plot itself makes sense but the characters don't br br this might sound picky but considering that the city of olympus is almost exclusively populated by living machines would you feel comfortable there as a human would any machine ever emulate human arrogance short sightedness and greed quite so effectively i doubt it there are some pointers towards this in the movie but only when the team can be bothered to put them in by and large the or whatever they are are interchangeable with human characters seems sloppy to me br br the main characters seem to have some kind of emotional entanglement though no light is shed on this little light is shed on the backstory at all a great pity the short length of the film coupled with the focus on mecha and the crime means that we don't see any character depth the all down yet we're left with no finished product a cropped version of this oav would have made a great tv episode once some character sub plots had been established br br the highlights of this short film are the mecha designs and the action espionage br br the flaws really start to show through once you've had a chance to digest all the goings on so i couldn't recommend this for owning but it's certainly worth a watch or two whilst this review is mostly negative i really do think it's worth your time to watch this but it's not something to rush out and buy br br in a nutshell a watchable wasted opportunity,1
1725,i thought that this movie might be a good spoof or at least a good independent comedy like friday instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad many great films have been made on a low budget it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp case in point for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope put on their makeup and then answer a phone call you keep waiting for something to get story moving but it never comes the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying which wasn't interesting anyways if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers,0
1726,i feel very strongly that this film was just like waiting to exhale with white females in the 1950's as in waiting to exhale all of the female characters got mixed up with men who were either married or no good the only difference besides the obvious was that there wasn't much humor in this film i would even say that it was tragic only one of the male characters seemed to be kind and sincere hope lange's guy but even then there was conflict in this relationship br br the story was about three young women who shared an apartment together and who had hopes and dreams of success unfortunately for them romance didn't seem to come easy although they were young intelligent and attractive this movie could be called a tearjerker with the saddest part involving suzy parker's character whose obsession of an ex boyfriend leads to tragedy br br this is a must see,1
1727,let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place i had to watch it one day and i figured that i guess i can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is and it might turn out to be entertaining what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen bar none first of all there was nothing humorous in the least bit the creators expected humor to be laughable passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of mouth and use scene after scene of bland played out aspects to charm the audiences light hearted side while still making them ooh and ah for more with boring action scenes and insipid lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it the acting was dull the humor was tedious and the characters plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it which even though that's what age range it was aimed at that does not excuse it for being so poorly daft and causing me to feel so parents spend your money on up wall e the chronicles the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best recent family kids flicks or even alvin and the chipmunks is better than this filth,0
1728,i believe that this is one of elizabeth montgomery's best performances in a movie and i have seen most of her movies i saw this for the first time on television when i was around fourteen and i was so scared i watch this movie every now and then and i still enjoy it very much i know that these days that this movie would probably not scare people too much that just goes to show that the public movie and television audience has seen too much graphic violence in the last thirty years or so i love movies that do not show the graphic details you let your imagination do the work for you the cast in this movie was top notch jess walton who played the sister in the story was very good even though her part was rather small she also played in a terrific made for television thriller around the same time called you'll never see me again with david hartman i got the biggest kick out of eileen performance as the housekeeper eileen was so good as a lady with a very bad disposition george who played the husband was quite effective this story obviously had a lot of so called mistakes in the plot but i love the movie anyway i highly recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphic violence i gave this movie a vote of seven,1
1729,the gilmore girls is about a mother who had a daughter when she was 16 now the daughter is 16 in season 1 and they live like sisters sharing everything trusting each other completely br br i like the gilmore girls but i am not sure why the mother named lauren graham and the daughter named rory short for played by alexis are both very beautiful women they are both funny and they are charming in their own ways there are some funny supporting characters such as luke scott patterson he and like each may be even love each other but neither of them really acts on it they have their little moments there are some other supporting characters most of them very funny and with their won touching moments br br what i like the most i think is to see the relationship between the young mother and the daughter who is becoming an adult the dialogue between them is quick sharp funny and sometimes touching as well the band they have is beautiful the gilmore girls makes you feel good so try it,1
1730,rendered in beautiful water colors at the cliff is definitely a sight to behold vaguely remembering the trailer witch i didn't find that impressive i was surprised at how beautiful and detailed it was this film just washed over me with its purity br br at the center is a young boy that comes into contact with a sea creature and its their relationship that carries the movie miyazaki is a master both at creating memorable imagery and showing young ones interacting in a believable way with their little quirks intact br br there are a few parts that didn't sit well with me it would be an understatement to say that the music during a particular scene resembled ride of the its a shame because such a precious film as this cant afford to take liberties and it hurt a otherwise truly great scene the antagonist and its back story never interested me either but i guess it served more as a background then anything else br br anyway great film the boat trip scenario with all its imagery and sea creatures stood out me thinks pure and magical and yes artwork is more intimate then computer animated i'm really pumped for princes and the frog now,1
1731,i suffered the watching of this movie at festival last month if there would be a possibility of a movie to avoid its existence this should be the first in the list maría isn't a director she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout action makes her a professional film maker what a mistake the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera his character don't have specific weight in the movie the same thing can tell about joss ackland vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida it's a shame the way rade serbedzija's character has been written warning spoilers br br he spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way now i'm doing this now i'm low of bats i'll search in my bag now i'm turning left now i'm turning right only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions it's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director end of spoilers br br the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it zero,0
1732,if you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this ain't it if you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you there are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy let's start with the opening titles that say jack o and then add the word lantern as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie after that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense jack o is everywhere he's in people's houses in the woods and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything he does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish jack o would take out his rage on you the viewer other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line the acting in this film is among the worst i've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie watching the boy who is the lead in the film the director's son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actors actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bug eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers but having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie what i also found amusing is that the makers of the dvd saw fit to release a 10th anniversary version of this movie as if the original wasn't good enough and someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition i'm not sure why i'll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10,0
1733,a fantastic film featuring great aussie talent director mark dealt with the potentially sob inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing definitely the highlight of the 2000 brisbane international film festival australian film veteran sam neill was as always fabulous in the role of frank's uni professor and new talent matt newton gave a performance which will have people saying you know bert newton matt's dad get out and see this movie,1
1734,this adorable dog called various names during the film is seemingly loved by the whole town but he's alone he is friends with two children cindy and paul played astonishingly bad but their father won't let them have a dog then benji meets tiffany another adorable dog they instantly fall in love and it leads to a hysterical montage of the two of them frolicking in the grass drinking from a fountain in slow motion no less also benji lives in the cleanest abandoned house i've ever seen then the two kids are kidnapped by the most inept unfunniest kidnappers i've ever seen and wouldn't you know it they hide the brats in the exact house benji lives in br br wow was this bad a huge hit for some reason in 1974 which led to many sequels which i will not see the film is just terribly acted with humor so unfunny and badly done that you just stare at the tv in amazement the film also has a song that is played nonstop during the movie so much that you want to scream it was inexplicably nominated for best song at the oscars it didn't win yeah the dogs are adorable and much better than the human actors but i need more than cute dogs to keep me interested br br you might think i'm being a little hard on a kids film but i saw it with my 5 year old nephew within 20 minutes he was bored silly and basically stopped watching i kept watching in hope that it would get better it didn't really lousy but very patient kids or dog lovers might like it br br note to parents it's g rated but a dog is viciously kicked a few times you don't see it you just hear it and the dog survives but this might bother real young kids,0
1735,this is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the 1920s the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring non laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie they are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film compared to shorts by chaplin keaton arbuckle and lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds i ended up turning off the sound due to the of the music to set the proper mood but despite this they are still worth seeing br br i've gotta be honest about this short it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts so it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4 but certainly if this is the case no better than a 5 the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there,0
1736,the 1994 film production of heart of darkness was in no way capable of living up to the outstanding book the film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than aiding them in understanding what was going on the director was obviously not experienced and if he is then he didn't show it on top of that scenes from the book were left out or changed scenes that were rather important the movie left me feeling rather bored and was a complete waste of my time the characters acted as though they had no idea what was going on and the actors did not portray the emotions that marlow and the rest revealed in the book overall the movie was terrible and completely lacked the suspense that was otherwise necessary to make it even remotely interesting,0
1737,the real life case of an innocent first nations chief the indian by an winnipeg city officer the cowboy is the basis of this tv movie the actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in canada a small scale martin luther king thing the of first nations people is becoming a staple in the canadian cinema diet what makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions the father played by gordon demands forgiveness and the brother played by eric demands justice the stars gordon and adam beach have minor almost cameo appearances soon to be star eric makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance an honourable mention goes to veteran actor gary chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit his portrayal of the troubled soul inspector was worthy of a award the canadian emmy along with eric the special effects jump cuts dream sequences are occasional and not overbearing couple this with some beautiful northern canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and first nations people like the neil case and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience,1
1738,the deadly mantis certainly won't scare any one but as sci fi programmers go it is better than most a volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole military men go missing dr ned william hopper hopper's son and best known as paul drake on television's perry mason is called in to i d the creature but by this time the creature has eaten up several eskimo and is en route to the washington monument br br about a third or more of the film consists of stock footage old government educational films military men in radar rooms air planes and would you believe eskimos putting out to sea which explains of course why a tribe of eskimo is attacked in the movie hey guys think we can work this in mix in some negligible special effects some clunky dialogue and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go not as original as the monster that challenged the world but fans of 1950s big bug schlock will enjoy it and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer,0
1739,after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies particularly mysteries and dramas but not female oriented movies this probably makes a huge difference so take my review with a large grain of salt i thought the acting was a bit over the top but that is very common in movies of this era june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments i hate writing negative reviews but the movie left me very cold it has always been my intention to read the book but after this that seem unlikely the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience again there are others who love this movie i'm just not one of them,0
1740,this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women the universe the better life the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who all links with everyone including his three years old child which may seem irresponsible to some actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie br br the scene with the father who left home when i was a child has been told and told and told of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life and when you see the hero's wife's attitude you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib br br the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson tom waits or bonnie raitt but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work,0
1741,br br this is the best mock documentary of a dog show that i have seen in a long time a very long time well lets face it ever isn't that part of the charm the idea of actually going to the trouble to make a movie mocking a documentary about an event that most people would find odd in the first place even if there were no big laughs one would still be smirking at the thought any movie that attempts something new scores highly in my proverbial book i loved the dogs too,1
1742,first off i'm in the u s br br when i first saw this i thought it was an obvious and loathsome rip off of the office uk i would have thus awarded it zero stars but lo and behold it came out long before the ricky gervais series br br still it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic including the american office without comparison it just isn't even close to being the same thing br br i will give it some credit for being original and ahead of its time i'll also say that it and the u s office and larry sanders are actual satires the uk office is something grander and more transcendent as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened however unlike this or the shrill christopher guest mockumentaries it isn't really a satire while the definitely is br br be that as it may the still isn't very funny it's aloof and self aware but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods it's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders commendable but ultimately not recommended br br and what's with the lack of an anamorphic dvd i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels cbc get with the programme,0
1743,owen david and chloe denise richards are a youngish couple living in manhattan owen is a moderately successful magazine writer while chloe is an aspiring actress happily for her chloe gets big role on a sitcom and temporarily moves to hollywood missing her owen books a flight to lala land as a surprise when he arrives at her set trailer however the house is shaking as chloe and her hunky co star are having a little romantic tryst the writer and the actress are through hurt and mad as a hatter owen goes back to nyc sympathetic friends decide to set him up on a blind date with nadine milla jovovich to get him out of his sulky funk but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen's huge shoulder chip yet over the next few months astonishingly nadine and owen become pals who confide in each other and hang out can it turn into something more well who the heck cares this film is so stupid that most folks will yank it out of the dvd player after the first ten minutes the script is pathetic dismal and oh stupid too then again gives a very obnoxious and offensive performance as well jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines she has to spout william baldwin too reaches a career low with his crude and sex crazy role as owen's brother the only cast member who is any good is richards but she must cringe when she looks back at this one okay the costumes and production values are adequate then too there is one clever element in that occasionally the characters will speak their lines but cartoon bubbles will appear above their heads with the words of what they are truly thinking that doesn't save the film from bomb status don't be stupid dear film and romcom lovers do not rent buy or borrow this gigantic turkey i am the stupidest person on earth today for watching this thing until the bitter end,0
1744,that's how i'd sum it up there were other who said naked gun meets james bond i think mine is more accurate but i'm not neutral on that point o br br this movie is kind of a blast from the past it reminds you of the old movies from the '50s '60s and that's not only because it plays in that time period 1955 to be exact with the flashback exception but it's the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen the main actor here who is as i've been told very popular in his homeland france is perfect in his role here he's the spy with the number 117 attached to him there is one character who sums him up in the movie by asking a question about if he's good or not you'll see when you watch the movie br br very funny indeed this is and if you like your spies mixed with comedy with old school flair but not taking itself or anything else for that matter seriously than you need to watch this o,1
1745,alexander nevsky marked director sergei eisenstein's return to film making after a period of exile and what he produced is a bald faced propaganda film proclaiming russia's superiority over germany br br there's very little plot russians unite to battle germans russia wins the film is really an extended montage of mostly battle scenes mixed in with some moments of german brutality like a rather shocking scene that shows german soldiers throwing russian children onto a raging fire this was eisenstein's first sound film and it's clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium indeed this film really looks more like a silent film with some sound added there are some dialogue scenes but they sit rather lifelessly on the screen and the pacing is all off as if the actors weren't actually on the set together at the same time when they were filming them eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to overlay a rousing score over the proceedings and indeed that's one of the film's biggest assets br br say what you will about eisenstein's ability or lack of to direct actors or tell his film in a more narrative format he certainly knows how to edit images and music together for maximum effect and alexander nevsky over all shines through its deficiencies br br grade a,1
1746,ok at the time of writing 65 people voted for this movie bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating my guess is that only the film crew voted so i'm here to bring some justice to it all br br never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one given i laughed out loud quite a bit but the movie story absolutely didn't want me to br br i've seen a lot of bad movies a lot but man this one blows them all away br br speaking '96 computers ridiculous acting and wheelchair chases and we have young who can't get their ideas financed yup life's a cruel joke,0
1747,the most irritating thing about dies august days is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon unless mentioning name a few times constitutes an homage this pretense is an utter fraud you will learn virtually nothing about in this film nor about the spanish civil war 1936 1939 nor about the special role of catalunya in that war you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco br br the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful of course but dies does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue the large number of stills shown not very illuminating images of the forest floor for example is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema on the contrary one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced out middle aged hippies don't waste your time read a good book about the spanish civil war instead i recommend felix scathingly anti stalinist revolution and counter revolution in spain which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising br br barry freed,0
1748,what you need in the run up to 'what you need' every episode since 'the had been a winner to some extent this episode is the first major failure since the serling script is again based on someone else's a short story by lewis as with 'and when the sky was serling altered the content significantly removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler br br 'what you need' works best when it is being sweet the opening half in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted sadly the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes the minute steve performance as a two bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw his exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false ernest is good as the peddler bringing a magical mysterious but warm edge to the character but he's not good enough to help the floundering script br br to make matters worse the weak script is also full of inconsistencies for instance we learn that the power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses that seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power also for a man who can see the future the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat there are many more holes that can be picked in 'what you need' but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway,0
1749,i´m from germany so please excuse my style of writing as i´ve seen chucky 4 for the first time i was a bit surprised i knew chucky as a usual 80s but bride of chucky was very different from the old ones first there is the artwork of the very good director ronny yu who we still have in mind from a chinese ghost story his visual style is in a wired kinda way comparable to francis ford coppola also the voices of chucky an tiff are very impressive i´ve also liked the screenplay very much especially the scene in which tiff throws the in the br br i give it a 9 0 vote for funny gory and progressive entertainment if you have any comments on my opinion just send me an e mail,1
1750,what a crap that movie is the script is simply non existent the movie at times seems like a music video but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match pathetic way of combining action and rap one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick here it fails miserably dialogues in this flick just killed me the scene when harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful generally speaking recent seagals films are hardly watchable what the hell happened to the guy i know he's old but can't he get hollywood to drop him a decent script or something is he running out of dough for his escapades to india that he takes on anything they serve him,0
1751,what an embarassment this doesnt do justice to the original with awful acting from everyone in this movie hitchcock must be spinning in his grave the where marion gets killed in the shower is just so uneffective and unoriginal the only good bit is that they used the same music and its so obvious who kills her in the shower i rate this movie 3 10,0
1752,i was not old enough to really appreciate the original mod squad but i knew everyone thought it was cool i have some of the books that were written based on the series in my screen to print collection and they're pretty light duty so i didn't expect much from the movie that's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long leash br br i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit the movie audience though has gained sophistication in 30 years at least i think so i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept with now old car chases now considered poor camera work tinny sounding soundtrack and poor script and all on the big screen in the 1960s we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough it was that another thrilling episode of ironsides or password br br rating this episode against usual theatre releases the story was well i'm not sure i should even say because i'm not sure there was one drugs are bad whatever the script was silly when the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like i overheard him say so on the phone and i think i got a plan we really are in trouble no wonder the acting was dreadful no one knew how to say such idiotic lines br br if i were claire danes i'd be going after my agent with a flame thrower right now actually i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution br br and where was the mod in that squad i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall but no one had a velvet suit mod only meant young and integrated what happened to white go go boots perhaps the costume department was going for gritty but all they got was dirty and dingy br br since the movie was completely true to the original series and required special behavior from the actors cameramen stunt men etc we should appreciate it more unfortunately i still don't like it if i wanted to watch 60's crime drama i'd buy dvds no thanks,0
1753,beware my lovely came on tv on bbc2 recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i did br br a man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar he then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happened br br i can see why beware my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too br br the cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boy br br this is certainly robert ryan's most chilling performance i've seen a must see br br rating 4 stars out of 5,1
1754,i had this dvd to watch thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter goya but the movie was about everything but goya this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy inquisition allegedly because she practiced jewish rituals only because the poor girl did not like eating pork the rest of the movie is about torture humiliation driven by a poor script can't believe it is by jc carrière as i could not believe this cr is directed by mr milos forman centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all br br ah and there is goya i forgot playing a completely peripheral role that could be the role of john paul peter manuel joaquim jose or anyone very disappointing one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever if it has not had happened yet rent the name of the rose if you want a movie about the holy inquisition and i don't know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter goya maybe a director of a good caliber not forman still needs to make it ps the spanish painter goya the title role who is lost in the plot is portrayed by a scandinavian actor something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously maybe next time we should send javier to play the biopic of norwegian painter munch,0
1755,while the david lynch version of dune is choppy awkward and unfaithful to the novel it is visually well designed and well acted the best one can say about the sci fi channel's attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious actually that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer the actors with few exceptions seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible and the least appropriate accents the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering br br in part this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort however it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale i e the guild navigation sequence and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film a for effort d for virtually everything else,0
1756,any movie should have an idea simple or more complex it needs one the problem with fragata it's once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasons they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind it's boring and sad to see them appearing and vanishing like cards being discarded in a game fragata always seem to have talent in advertising is own work and that leads you to see what he did but in the end there's always a big disappointment it's not enough having a movie full of the hot pink magazine stars especially when half of them can't act they only pretend to be funny here my only good point goes to the actor mendes one of the few non stars' he makes the effort to establish some credibility and in such a messy movie without any direction of any kind i give him the credit for trying hard but this movie its worth to check out as a manual of how to not do a movie and if previous works where bad this one it's a masterpiece in achieving the title of awful in few words just check it out it will make you good and if you homemade your family movies and always feel bad with your work so just spend 30 minutes looking to this so called professional work your home made stuff will look like powerful hollywood flicks compare to sorte nula,0
1757,i'm from australia and have watched with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding rugby union in new zealand i can totally appreciate the comments made by in relation to this movie it was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport br br whoever was involved in the making of this atrocious movie should be made to formally apologize to anyone who had the misfortune of watching it note people do not kneel down and cry while slowly reciting the what a pitiful scene this was br br are we supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed his girlfriend who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain then apparently saw the light what a thoroughly dislikable character with the visits to children's hospitals doing nothing to redeem his despicable personality br br and why are people even making a movie about americans playing rugby they barely even feature in the sport on the world stage not so much as to even warrant an attempt at making a movie about it yes a 'world' sport unlike gridiron and baseball,0
1758,i was wondering if there was a place or a link that someone can send me or post for me so i can watch this show it seems to be a missing show i have been looking for years now its about oz and a girl who has to help save it it was really good but i found a good oz type thing on the web but i cant find it again or seem to remember a lot of it due to being years and was thinking that this one maybe it and from reading all this it sounds good and maybe the missing show that i really liked please someone help me thanks so much so please anyone that can help me or give me a link that would be so helpful again thank you so much or if anyone has an oz based good videos please post as well,0
1759,john leguizamo's one man show is both funnier and more involving than most movies you'll see a number of devices such as slide projectors are used to enhance the story but this is essentially good old fashioned performance art in particular check out his hilarious rendition of i will survive highly recommended,1
1760,i recently waisted 8 by going and see this movie in the cinema it was a waste of time and the only feeling you get going out of the theater is a slightly nauseous of all the disgusting social pornography br br it could have been interesting if it had a quite absurd twist but it hadn't so it was just plain awful with maybe one or two scenes which could have been taken out and made to very nice short movies br br another thing i thought about is the way the director uses all the finish stereotypes as characters it is quite extraordinary how you as a finish director can make a movie with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality it was sad to sit and and hear the audience sitting and laughing at things that they thought was typical finish but in general just is making fun of people,0
1761,regardless of what anyone says its a b movie and the effects are poorly done if you're a vampire fanatic i suppose it would be ok not 10 out of 10 you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as a movie not read it as a book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story the story are good but it doesn't carry the film no wonder it has a low rating over all i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb but got severely disappointed don't get me wrong i thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters aren't close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you don't care about acting or make up this is better as a book 3 out of 10 for an ok story,0
1762,if you love movies about fruity dudes who prance around with a top hats and while spouting off random line of poetry while stabbing their victims then this is the movie for you br br if you like movies where it looks like the whole thing was shot with a camcorder and when people get disemboweled their internal organs are made out of baked ziti an sauce this movie is even more for you br br and if you simply love movies where the acting and dialogue sucks so much that it makes you feel dead inside then for god's sake run to the video store right now and buy this movie right now hurry go before it sells out,0
1763,cant believe it after all these years finally tracked this down it was meant to be named 'the great at production stage i was living in oz at time and through a friend was looking after one of the house locations through filming it was me that showed these guys how to speak scottish and after all this time i only realise now one was russell crowe it has taken me all these years to track this down was even unsure if it ever went to screen as i left oz the following month after wrap up party at that time russell crowe was not the demanded actor he is now and i had no idea it was him until i saw the previous comment then thought back to the days during filming amazing truly delighted with myself now,1
1764,this movie was quite a pleasant surprise i had anticipated it for a long time and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations br br it exceeded them br br i adored this movie br br hilarious from start to finish stay until after the end credits it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent witty and engaging br br with it's obvious matte paintings the movie's future earth recalls the planet of the apes series and other sci fi movies of that era br br in fact this movie is essentially planet of the apes but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes br br it moves at a fairly brisk pace and luke wilson carries the movie quite well with a character that recalls the one he played in bottle rocket there's even a not so subtle nod to bottle rocket in an early scene br br maya is also surprisingly good as a former painter who was frozen as well br br despite all its strengths idiocracy has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director editor before it could be fine tuned br br i cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings no trailers no marketing whatsoever br br it's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away br br or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail br br whatever the case it is a shame because mike judge and this film in particular deserve better br br i predict this movie will have real legs on dvd and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves br br perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in the characters were confused and thought it was a documentary,1
1765,let me start out by saying i love horror movies big budget low budget big name actors no name actors it doesn't matter and when it comes to judging movies i am very forgiving this movie however is pretty bad br br the actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines and the acting is worse than many lower budget horror flicks i've seen as the actors get killed off you could care less there is very little gore i have no idea what film other reviewers watched when they say there is good gore in this one because there isn't and the special effects are substandard at best they steal so much from so many better horror movies jeepers creepers friday the 13th leprachaun and it still doesn't help br br luckily i saw this on showtime and didn't have to actually pay any extra money to see it or waste a spot in my netflix queue on it there are so many better horror movies out there and i recommend you see those instead of this big letdown,0
1766,i must first mention that as a group of mates we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value hence our rental of camp blood br br camp blood was the first film which we'd rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder and was so rubbish it wans't even funny br br the dvd was returned and a refund was demanded with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stocked br br don't do what i did and let the curiosity get the better of you it's so bad it's not even funny,0
1767,as embarrassing as it is to admit i was listed as production manager on this film my very first as a matter of fact it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated watch carefully and you even get to see me in one of the opening scenes as a soon to be murdered asylum attendant named my own last name br br originally titled hostages this picture was changed to another son of sam by the producer director who wanted to cash in on the serial killer in the news at the time nothing could have helped i don't even think this picture was good enough to be shown on mst 3k br br the film was shot primarily with a collection of old mitchell cameras and early hand held cameras matter of fact the shot of the helicopter during the hostage siege was filmed with my own wwii era the picture was filmed entirely in charlotte and belmont north carolina in the mid seventies most of the stars were local tv newscasters and the rest of the crew were just inexperienced enough or gullible enough to believe former stuntman and producer director dave a adams' delusions of br br if you enjoy watching this kind of picture you might love the work of another north the legendary earl br br,0
1768,i have never seen a movie so bad it's not even entertaining enough to be a drinking game br br it's so bad i don't even want to talk about it and that's the whole point of this isn't it please don't bother to see this movie said,0
1769,i've seen just after i've seen all roger moore films and i must say that it felt so good to see connery again he proves for all times that he is the one and only bond br br the film itself isn't really a masterpiece but it is really worth watching the jokes sit much better here the effects are funny and interesting connery is connery and brandauer is really a good villain but von sydow is just wasted and the score is not often good and there are a few scenes that seem pretty unnecessary br br 7 10 2 5 4 3 1 6,1
1770,there is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for airport 77 you can even make out jack lemmon and christopher lee in some of the shots a total rip off well almost by definition there may be more stock footage in this film than in plan 9 from outer space br br all the new material actors sitting around in an airplane set talking is bland and terrible on every level dennis weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie though that's true for everyone other than this films director fred olen ray who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working br br there is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all because ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school tv fashion that this film like most of his films is totally devoid of life the worst kind of hack work the worst kind of film boring br br this type of film is a waste of money an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared participated in this rip off there are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time br br his commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really fred ray as he isn't credited on the film itself that tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you,0
1771,i used to work in a video store i saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free rental one night br br this movie was truly awful there is no redeeming quality about it because it actually takes a well respected sub genre of film and just goes about destroying it if the first film wasn't low budget enough then this film truly takes the biscuit being housed mostly indoors and at night therefore avoiding the scenic cost setting of the first film in the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically runs over an attractive student rather than be mortified the lecturer half heartedly apologises and the girl mentions that despite being thrown across the cars bonnet he sped up as he approached her that there is nothing to worry about after which he attacks her with a crowbar and kills her if this isn't strange enough he wants to perform an experiment upon her bringing her back from the dead and so feels the need to remove her clothing to do so br br soft core female nudity and pubic hair is rampant throughout the film and is to be honest the only real thing to hold the average male viewers interest like the swimming scene in the first film but even having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad character acting crappy dialogue and absurd plot turns why introduce a pivotal character who has survived 29 days from zombie attack only to kill them within 10 minutes its just a very very bad film,0
1772,it was sad that committed lasted only two weeks in dallas theaters i thought this movie had a lot going for it the script was funny full of subtle emotional shifts and it had a good message the acting was great everyone did a superb job especially with the script's subtleties heather graham not only has beautiful eyes she has expressive eyes for that matter all the actors were attractive why it didn't do well in its theatrical release i don't know other than the studio didn't seem to have much of a push behind it but it deserved to do better and i hope it does well on video it's certainly one of my favorites for the first half of 2000,1
1773,it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence in fact violence both disturbing and cartoonish is the last of oldboy 's deep flaws the characters are unidimensional underdeveloped primitive the intensity an obsession and a goal in itself with this director is served up with the cheapest of means let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth by the end of the movie it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of horror to continue to shock an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap opera revelations already served up in big bunches it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice cream for the same money be smart homer go for the ice cream,0
1774,to put in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by pathetic the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot but but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall br br it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull directed by a debutant and acted by high school students movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not so great indian movie her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery br br overall i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch then try watching it at home when some tv channel airs it believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors br br and better carry a aspirin u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel p s i have no clue if the other reviewers even watched the movie i did and wasted my 10 on the ticket,0
1775,just saw this movie 2 days ago a very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine i have no special interest in wine and yet i found this very enlightening the director gave me the impression that he has the ability to show people as they are while he exposes a lot of things that are below the surface he manages not to take a stand and leave that for the viewer he shows a lot of compassion to people and dogs and sympathy and let people tell their story and in the same time exposes what they don't want to tell br br the movie shows us where our world is going to what are the benefits and what is the heavy price we pay it is a movie about the love of wine and the love of making it big personal and global character and formula br br the real stars of the people for me are the older wine makers with their disillusioned look at the world and themselves br br it takes some time to get use to the hectic camera moves and editing but it's worth it br br highly recommended,1
1776,it's difficult to express how bad this movie is even in the 1950s when intellectual searching for the meaning of life was fashionable and beatnik rejection of physical comforts clean clothes haircuts etc was a common reaction to the smug middle class mores of both the usa and western europe this movie would have been a stinker the plot is a mishmash of several dei ex machina if that's the correct latin grammar the acting consists of deadpan stares broken by occasional hysterics by the male lead as well as the females the gratuitous view of catherine deneuve's or somebody's breasts are worthy of a budweiser commercial the repeated orchestra rehearsal in the abandoned building is i'm sure heavy with meaning in the director's mind but to me is just one more stupid symbol thrown into this meaningless movie i'm ranting because my time has been wasted watching this scam excuse for an art flic the scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot but underneath his clothes this king has no substance,0
1777,this movie was not very well directed they almost totally disregarded the book i guess they were trying 2 save time the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played was cute some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary also i was surprised not pleasantly by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters leper was poorly interpreted and portrayed he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book over all disappointing,0
1778,i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes i was not just disappointed but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen and i've seen thousands of movies the plot was very confusing had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover prior to renting it i would have been totally lost throughout this film i would not have thought that tim robbins after having made such good films as shawshank redemption would have agreed to appear in this film,0
1779,john candy was very much a hit or miss comic actor his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but wagons east in which he plays a bumbling who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west is even sadder i don't understand why it was even released the story is pointless and weak and the jokes aren't there it saddens me even further that candy's last film would be his all time worst movie so let's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck br br 0 out of 5,0
1780,as a big fan of most modern fantasy movies i was really looking forward to this i was not familiar with the character although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie i thought i was in for a real treat br br from the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced husky voice i could tell straight away that i was not going to enjoy this movie i found the story weak and predictable the acting poor the effects were very good for a small budget film but did nothing for the overall plot br br maybe as a fan of the comics you may get something more from this otherwise i would suggest that you skip it and not waste you cinema fare on this boring adventure,0
1781,heh i'm surprised this movie still exists in any form let alone it being available for rent br br this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the t a and the cheap laughs the story line crosses a bit of texas chainsaw massacre with a screwy centred back story reminiscent of psycho and a bit of the good old women in chains tough as nail ex con broads tossed in for good measure in other words complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of quebec pass off as southern u s bayou land is sad i tell ya br br funny thing for me is i was actually at the premier of this flick as at the time i was pals with the film's star it was painful to watch on as jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings br br i'm happy to see that after this sham of a first flick has grown into one hell of an actor he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama blue murder has appeared on csi not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film unforgiven we forgive ya jeremy it was a rocky start but you done good man br br t paul,0
1782,when i was a child this was the movie i watched i think it is a great movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to be afraid of any violence or obscene images rainbow is a cheerful young girl and she is trying to make the winter go away she finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it for themselves i love this movie and i think that even adults can enjoy this movie,1
1783,laughed my ass off but probably because i was stoned that aside this is in no way a horror movie there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average iq person would think it was stupid on top of that i am living in denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that denmark is way too small a country that you need and maps to find your way back if you got lost i would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot secondly i don't think any part of the movie apart from two shots from copenhagen where none of the actors were in were actually taped in denmark the bog woman is talking swedish not danish the helmet on the first bog body is brand new the girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in denmark this is just stupid,0
1784,i don't mind some adult humor but this feature was just downright dirty the first 10 minutes consisted of pryor swearing at some guy taking pictures followed my even more profanities i don't know what happened between that time the the last 5 minutes because i walked out after seeing this i never looked at richard pryor the same way again and to think that he actually went on to host a childrens' show br br if profanity and tasteless unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh then you'll probably enjoy this but if you're an old fashioned type then don't bother,0
1785,simply one of the best movies ever if you won't get it sorry for you i believe that someday people will include this one in their all time top 10's not now but in the far future,1
1786,as with many sequels this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats this one just doesn't cut it the first film had a magical good time feeling about it that is totally missing from this film we became enamored of all these characters minus richard dreyfuss in an age of innocence now a few years later they have changed so much that they are largely different people while this is what happens in real life we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters the film doesn't have the humor that the original had and we were expecting to laugh what little humor is there is dark the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever while this one is good but not even close to the original's this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel i gave it a 4,0
1787,the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of 1958 in vienna and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years despite the political problems which influenced the movie's success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and yul brynner their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major and diana another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george tabori the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didn't know if diana and the other travelers could leave hungary because the communist major discovers that diana's friend paul is hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go but after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including paul while is shot several times by some hungarians so he dies yul brynner is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an english lady yul and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction anatole litvak is in my opinion at his best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who restore and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible,1
1788,the plot seemed to be interesting but this film is a great dissapointment bad actors a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur if there was c movies this would be a perfect example a plus for a nice dvd cover though and a great looking female actor,0
1789,i have long tried to understand why people like shakespeare so much and every few years i give him another go i was hoping that this play film my 6th different shakespeare play would unlock the lucky casket and marry me to the riches of this literary demigod bah i clearly chose the wrong key br br once the phrase pound of flesh had been uttered 10 minutes into the film the main parts of the plot were transparent which grinds along with a languid script and lifeless acting at every step the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance the concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is incredulous it is no surprise who wins the matrimonial jackpot because a main protagonist in the play and he's the third man to try and there are three caskets to choose from and his friend risks his life to pay the dowry the only genuine surprise that i had watching this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case however as soon as the ring treachery began it was immediately apparent what would transpire br br ok so i know that millions of you love shakespeare not for the surprise in the well known stories but for the depth and passion of the characters but i felt nothing for the characters rather than gripped with suspense and admiration during the court scene i sat there hoping that it would be over soon please br br one day i might just find a shakespeare play that does something other than bore me,0
1790,three young college women and pia go on an adventure canoing down the river dividing their slovenia from neighboring croatia in this 2002 slovenian film by maya weiss what could have been an eastern european version of the well known and exciting 1972 deliverance turned out for me to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the characters br br and are not convincing as students at all though expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life even less scholarly is a self absorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women i had some sympathy with relatively innocent conservative and starry eyed the very idea of these three traveling together just doesn't work for me the disdain that and show toward makes no sense why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudes br br the three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes undeterred by a news story of a woman's disappearance along the river things become more somber with the mysterious appearance sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician jonas br br i did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit it may be because of a lack of cultural understanding but the film didn't move me otherwise i was surprised to see that the film has won some awards,0
1791,although i have definitely read this particular agatha christie book at some point i didn't remember anything about it except the name which is a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer genius of agatha christie the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness in addition to her stories the excellent production values beautiful locations wonderful music top notch acting elegant directing etc are the reasons for this series' success and timelessness and all those virtues are present in after the funeral a word of advice be alert right from the start there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence there are some quite unnerving moments as well in contrast to the peaceful looking english countryside locations and some small touches of humor a must see for mystery buffs and just a very good film in general,1
1792,really really what pleases audience american one in this so called show is totally beyond me what can we learn from these series br br 1 each casino there is spending about 2 3 billion bucks every year to rent a satellite and enormous quantity of hi tech high resolution cameras for their security team let fbi bites the dust of them br br 2 every security employee must have voluptuous breasts of course natural ones the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job br br 3 if the employee happens to be a male he needs to get breasts implanted then go to step 2 br br 4 only in hollywood one can blatantly rip off other show's ideas then implement them as their own and call all this crap original and art br br 5 every security with tits bigger than is considered immortal and cannot die br br i really would like to have the opportunity to vote with minus values 10 10 for this one,0
1793,i initially tuned in to paranormal state because i more or less find the paranormal search genre to be interesting tv if nothing else br br i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy british women with paris hilton day glo eyes fainting from fear demonic presences all shot in lovely night vision green br br paranormal state has none of this appeal it feels like it was cobbled together from leads that ghost hunters rejected the episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves to an interview with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room the monster goes we are told all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems the whole show is about ryan and his partner his enormous ego he leads his troupe of doe eyed coeds around except when a case is deemed too extreme and orders them to remain at the hotel hahaha better leave it to the pros ie himself br br the unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are ryan spins his tales of being hunted followed etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church recruited him to assist on a case sorry but the catholic church has people who can do that they don't need the day shift manager at to chip in his 2 cents br br this show is awful shame on a e for bankrolling this silliness trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themed shows it's almost unintentionally funny except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn't worth the trouble,0
1794,one of the worst movies i've ever seen completely ridiculous the story is bad the animations are completely childish and displaced the physics of the holograms are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong omg i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it yuck the actresses are somewhat beautiful but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one final remark bad film don't bother to watch it if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other alternatives like monster inc or an enchanted story on theaters seriously,0
1795,i am not sure who is having more fun the people that wrote the reviews or the director of the movie i could not go any longer reading this comments or watching this movie i had to say something br br i can see a low budget western film that is done with passion and interest on the detail but using a garage with art deco lettering pastel colors actors that seem to be falling sleep because the script is so boring and the boom getting on the way of the camera every two scenes that is definitely not my definition of one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium br br please if any of you guys had friends in the movie just say it,0
1796,oddly i have very little to say about the box so this will be pretty brief i have never read the richard matheson novella button button from which the film is based but considering what i saw in this adaptation there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work the box is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it frank langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button the only is that it will automatically kill someone somewhere spoiler they push it end of spoilers that whole concept was interesting on its own but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted stargate knock off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message while i'm trying to be as as possible i still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely i guess its from the same director as donnie darko which i remember liking when i saw it years ago the box would've worked well as a short film but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way i can't come close to recommending it,0
1797,watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish the story is always entertaining the tension never loosing up the whole cast is wonderful the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine  it's sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry for me it added to the pleasure it's the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation he's very good in a small role as pimp even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold i can highly recommend this movie,1
1798,this movie was awesome if you want a movie with non stop puns and laughter then this is right for you this movie was great because it took the serious robin hood and made it something the whole family can enjoy and get a good laugh at i first viewed this movie when i was around 10 and got most of it this movie is also great because it makes fun of everything involved by order of the kings financial secretary h and r blockhead br br everyone needs a little cary elwes robin hood in life whether or not its liar liar with the claw or saw br br this movie is worth watching,1
1799,although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni as di i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting the young director paolo had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren requiem for a dream they both used the same mtv style filming combined with modern alternative techno music making the film  le stand apart from the other crime mafia movies in its genre even though the movie may start of very slow paced almost sec compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity marvellous character portray and splendid ending definitely a must see for people who enjoy the european italian cinema ps toni keep on acting like this we need an encore,1
1800,just about every commentator has mentioned the way that some of the interview footage is over the concert footage in places this is true and is the biggest flaw of this film however it isn't so often or so bad that one shouldn't see this video if you are a black sabbath fan you have to see this aside from having seen black sabbath in the and early eighties i saw them in 2005 or 2006 when they also headlined just like in this video the concert was amazing and very much like this which was why i rented this in the first place it's just about the best geezer rock out there check it out,1
1801,anybody who goes to the manhattan hospital center is taking his life in his hands that includes the staff of the hospital br br i had never seen the hospital before and i was intrigued at how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other paddy masterpiece network there are elements in george c scott's character that have both al schumacher's and howard br br he's the administrator of the hospital and he's mad as hell and not going to take it any more he's completely estranged from his wife and kids it takes a faye dunaway type character in the person of diana rigg to make him snap out of it one roll in the hay with her and he's shocked back to reality and the fact he still can contribute in the world br br but first he's got a real problem someone is out killing hospital staff four of them in a 48 hour period and the nice part is their deaths can be attributed to in large part to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy that's where the comedy comes in br br there is an actual howard beale type character in the person of barnard hughes diana rigg's father his end is not quite as dramatic as though br br back in my working days it was part of my job to pay medical suppliers some of them could be as big creeps as you'll find portrayed in the hospital the black comedy satire had some real bite to it for me br br george c scott was nominated for best actor but having won and refused to accept the previous year's oscar for patton he wasn't about to get a second chance he lost to gene hackman for the french connection still his handling of the role is unforgettable br br try viewing the hospital back to back with network and see how many similarities you spot,1
1802,i own this movie on dvd and i have watched it about 10 times and it's still funny the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them the premise is that richard and eddie of bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in britain next to a nuclear power plant they are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in br br to watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour some would say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it but overall it's a great movie,1
1803,after a few misfires we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify but will launch a new trend not this time doug headline can't be accused of not being in the genre he is editor of a high class fantasy imprint has worked for legendary magazine but why a scenario that uses every cliché in the book except maybe the odious comic relief why make it so predictable even the nods towards argento fails flat it's not even an euro teen movie like the german anatomy much better just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes the whole celtic aspect is barely touched and after a painfully predictable the screenplay offers us a boring endless chase in a subterranean which seems bigger than parisian catacombs i really wanted to love this film really but even a mother would not oh and writer was supposed to have a cameo but i vainly looked for him,0
1804,this movie just stunk i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good just doesn't get it i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire but this is utter dreck the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does he is as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be or weird i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them milla is of course beautiful pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it milla rating 10 movie rating 0,0
1805,that's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film i just saw this baby at the munich film festival and it rocked the house director doug pray is never seen in this documentary nor i think he is even heard but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the mixer he has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about i was never big into scratching but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little and infusing in jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area mix master mike from the beastie boys is in this film but it wasn't until after the film that i could name several heavy hitters in the industry dj shadow q bert etc the extreme fascination for by these talented and quirky djs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them the film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys and one woman to be classified as musicians pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re energized by hardly ever music if nothing else this film will increase your slang vocabulary i have to get back to digging so i'll end this review see it it will be of interest good stuff man good stuff,1
1806,sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very very wrong as far as horror movies go and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun with br br however the writer decided to make a very straight very boring very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget abbot graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into beasts br br the five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left his 'punishment' being that he is unable to join his friends and thus 'be alone' what a load of rubbish br br the 'actors' are really poor this film has no comedy and it could have been so funny no gore and it could have been so gory no action and no horror and it could have had so much of both br br the director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch his experience in soft core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had as all the shots are the same with very few edits and little movement the quality overall is poor br br i'm not usually swayed by nudity in movies but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts,0
1807,at the time that this movie was made most housewives knew exactly who barbara stanwick was parodying today only some women over 50 probably remember gladys whose column wisdom ran in family circle magazine from before world war ii until the 1970's she lived on farm in and her columns were collected into a number of books seasons etc the lines that barbara stanwick recites as she types them for her column are quite typical of the ones that began a typical gladys column besides cooking and country living she got rather nostalgic and philosophical at times she talked a lot about her favorite dogs mostly cocker you might say that martha stewart is the gladys of today br br christmas is connecticut may not be any cinematic masterpiece but it is pleasant lighthearted entertainment soothing to the stressed out mind and that is good enough,1
1808,the preposterous premise of this flick has to do with argentina reclaiming the falkland islands having failed through force in 1982 by impregnating the european women inhabitants with argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored argentina yeah right the reconnaissance is done by our hero villan and cad fabian who his fish eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman camilla an unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip yada yada yada the film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as fabian and camilla their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed f is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak no frills austerity of dogme indies,0
1809,minor spoilers br br if there's something in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me it is that charley chase never got his well deserved break through in the movies oh well maybe it isn't that strange really inasmuch as he never starred in any full length features but when i think of it such an explanation makes it all only more mysterious because why the heck didn't chase get any offers to play the leading lead in features one explanation is that his character no matter how amusing was simply too realistic to suit a longer story without the burlesque elements that chaplin keaton lloyd langdon and other comedians possessed it can be assumed that the comedy he made and which worked so well for twenty minutes would get repetitive after a few more reels i don't quite buy this though as chase's gag construction is magnificent and could i believe at its best maintain the interest of viewers alone for a longer period at least i am tempted to think so when mighty like a moose runs the show br br mr moose isn't extraordinary handsome and mrs moose is hardly a classic beauty he possesses the truly biggest front teeth of any human being on the planet and she has a remarkably large nose both of them takes plastic surgery without the other's knowledge and when they meet by accident just a little later he doesn't recognize his wife and she doesn't recognize her husband a number of hilarious misunderstandings begin with many clever gags all the way through i don't think i'll reveal anything further to make the viewing more enjoyable for you because if you're a fan of silent comedies or even if you aren't mighty like a moose offers so many memorable moments within such a short time that i would look upon it as a downright shame not to see it silly indeed but no less extremely funny,1
1810,a less than redemptive junk that is mercifully free from the ravages of competence some northern idiots come to the deep south looking for some confederate rifles stashed on the legendary whiskey mountain they are menaced by scary hillbillies in a wide nod to 'deliverance' but it turns out that the hicks are for a northern marijuana trafficking badass this is brought to light so early that it doesn't even qualify as a twist the women are locked up and raped into catatonia rather than rescuing them the guys run down to town to get the sheriff who is lazy and doesn't believe them i think if my girlfriend were being raped i'd kind of take the shortest route to the hideout anyway it's ok though because as soon as they show up to the baddies the girls get all cheery and hop around if only trauma were like this in real life also featuring a backwoods guy with a beard who cackles a lot not exactly bursting at the seams with ideas,0
1811,the greatest tragedy man faces is that capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal from this fact does so much great tragedy emerge death in venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head on it confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms self denial and decay undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema its refined look echoey sound mixture of languages and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director the central performance at once rigid aroused and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights bogarde as if not the best british actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous able to hold on to sympathy as his desires take him over and interesting despite the endless close ups and score playing above him not one for a friday night with your girlfriend but certainly ok if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation,1
1812,comedy is a hard beast to conquer fails on all accounts as a writer and director some things like making movies that are funny just need to be left to the professionals 1 out of 10 awful it wasn't funny i tried to laugh but it just wasn't funny i wasn't the only one no one else at the chicago festival was laughing either at least at the showing i saw simply very bad sorry,0
1813,i find it hard to believe this could happen at all we do not know if justin and richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past the movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble so the first crime they commit is murder just to play and jostle with the cops how do they pick up any girl and just say you are it also richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle hmmm this whole concept is really hard to believe that said let's move on i found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then as for cassie who was a victim of carl hudson has a horrible time trying to survive the memory of having been stabbed 17 times by carl leaves her in an emotional mess sandra does a superb acting job she sure made me believe she was one angry cop as for solving the crime i thought it was great this movie kept me planted in my chair loved the acting of all but sam he had no get up and go the one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should i say the rape scene,1
1814,this film is a mediocre low budget flick i've seen much worse on mst3k let me assure you but this is still a pretty crappy film br br the film is about a top secret government facility in which clones are used to give organs to politicians it's an almost orwellian society actually almost but not quite effective br br the film starts to roll downhill when the head clone tim connely of fame falls in love with a female clone breen who appeared in this and at most four other films and this was not her first film they begin to suspect something after finding a beer can in the nearby river the plot starts to unravel the clone receives no answers from either the head scientist dick sargent from or the a computer which supposedly knows everything so he breaks into the main building and in a scene hilariously destroyed by mike and the bots finds out the truth including a clone video which eerily shows the exact same method that was used to clone dolly five years ago and this film was made over twenty years ago about he breaks free pursued by two guards he has one hell of a time breaking through the two foot high fences though he has a considerably harder time climbing up some boulders from there it continues to slide also appearing are peter graves beginning of the end' it conquered the world' as the presidential candidate and keenan wynn dr once upon a time in the west' and tuttle ma barker's killer psycho' as the elderly couple who help after he escapes br br the mst3k version was priceless one of the best episodes ever br br four stars for the film 10 for the mst3k version,0
1815,not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart especially women do not your man's dreams honor them that's why you loved him in the first place those who plan for death will live in the grave those who diem will awaken those who live in fear even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master take a risk get out of the boat and you will walk on water life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls,1
1816,c'mon let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest it isn't funny i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations and i'm not referring to the obvious black white commentary in the movie but to the slams towards other ethnicities such as betty white's characterizations of the hispanics should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash or is it the fault of the writers how about the third assistant makeup person nope the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap in the guise of comedy that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter we're all different let's celebrate that diversity not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness,0
1817,what a fine film unfortunately being 1947 the movie script couldn't have followed the book from which it was adapted but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era br br i thought all of the performances were outstanding as well as the script direction brilliant black and white cinematography music and film noir atmosphere br br i do understand that in 1947 the film couldn't portray racism against blacks or prejudice against homosexuals robert young's account of prejudice against his grandfather who was irish and who endured this racism 100 years ago was pretty lame but the times dictated that the film avoid a further examination of racism br br i do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer 1 did you notice that robert young didn't aim his gun when he shot and killed robert ryan who was running fast in the dark and young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming 2 if robert young's grandfather was killed 100 years ago in 1847 the film was made in 1947 and young was 40 years old the time line would not be logical if the grandfather had been killed 50 years ago then the time frame would be realistic,1
1818,it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of all this is a true story so you cant say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid personally i think this was the best love story i've ever seen and i am very pro gay i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay straight or bi unlike so many other shows maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things br br if you want something funny with one of englands best lesley sharp and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you i know i love it,1
1819,guy pearce almost looks like flynn and this resemblance is the only one this film can claim nowhere in flynn's autobiography is the klaus reicher character mention the homosexual encounter is speculative fiction and the movie's claims that flynn treated native labor badly are groundless director frank howson hasn't made any memorable films and i find it lame for him to slander flynn to further his unremarkable career br br,0
1820,so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see it's up there with crossbones and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years why does the camera make old school kung fu noises when it zooms why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die what is this highlander dracula mccloud who cares just laugh at it this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really ron hall's range of emotions are always off he looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag the special short bus kinda special effects are randomly placed and never needed most scenes are lit with a desk lamp if they are lit at all mel novak has the audacity to look off camera for his line and it's not even edited out they just keep on filming in fact half of this movie isn't even on film at all it's 1 2 film 1 2 sony hand cam for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain but oh do i love it thank you ron hall for this cinematic abomination i went out and bought it cause it's just so damn funny 1 99 on amazon and i had it rush delivered br br i have weapons i have weapons i have weapons,0
1821,this is a really obnoxious show it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' got in style tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste is a house show the place for sex appeal apparently some males like the show because they find tanya attractive the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone most of them like the 'crew' need to be taught manners i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste br br what happened to the arts and entertainment channel when it started out and for some years afterward it was filled with treats now it's one big trash machine,0
1822,after seeing this movie i have no choice but to write a review in the hopes that there are others like me out there who were blown away by the rocket fueled ninja action and white hot sexual titillation that is ninja iii the domination br br we all know that sho kosugi rocks that is a given but how about jordan bennett's ultra macho interpretation of his character police officer billy bravo mr bennett bravo you prove early on while trying to seduce the buxom christie played to perfection by one miss lucinda dickey of breakin' fame that you are not afraid to take chances on your craft i particularly enjoyed how you do not feel the need to step in and attempt to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym oh you could have helped sure but by standing there and watching you let her know who was boss will wear the pants in this relationship i also enjoyed how mr bennett was not afraid to repeatedly take off his shirt or wear the wife beater tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back back and shoulder hair are hot and knows it and how about lucinda dickey all i can say is i see a sex bomb getting ready to explode she's got all the right moves as both a temptress and a martial arts whiz the chemistry behind dickey and bennett is what makes this movie tick you'd think she would hate him because he's kind of a cheesy jerk but no my friends the animal magnetism is too strong to resist and they bond like crazy glue sho kasugi is not as prominent as you might think though still a main character which is fine by me because all i wanted was more bennett and dickey he does seem to wear a lot of eye makeup which was nice to see the special effects wow that is all i can say i will not give away the ending but let's just say it will not disappoint i love ninja iii the domination and can only hope that there is a ninja 4 i give it a 5 out of 5 throwing stars disappoint,1
1823,propaganda pro american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to enlist ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war overall though it's a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments the best of which tend to come here when they ad lib,0
1824,a good entertainment but nothing more in this western we are between the classics and the spaghetti ones this provides us a good a conventional story but it's always a pleasure to see robert mitchum with his legendary although he isn't as fit as in the forties or the fifties and don't forget david carradine is the son of john carradine,1
1825,my husband received dvd of for christmas and it was the best gift we received we watch it every time we need to laugh and so far we have viewed it 12 times the scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is outstanding we also purchased the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever we need a pick me up and that too is daily if anyone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers this movie is it the characters are hilarious charming and their facial expressions are too funny to describe i have always been a fan of george clooney but now i am also a fan of tim blake nelson delmar and john turturro pete and am now looking for them in other movies you gotta see this movie,1
1826,wow that james purefoy looks exactly like thomas jane br br that's the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather underwhelming george and the dragon for a fantasy comedy the story was very dull and the effects unspectacular br br the problem wasn't the acting james purefoy makes a good knight and his various side kicks are not bad characters i even thought patrick swayze in this role was a pretty good idea too flat chested piper perabo also had some nice potential i even liked the kid br br but the story and everything that happens and the way it happens was just eh not interesting compared to another recent fantasy comedy ella enchanted which was actually funny this movie comes up terribly short i'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn inducing br br 4 out of 10,0
1827,i caught this movie late night on tv and was expecting a low budget campy masterpiece i was surprised with a pretty decent movie angelina jolie's unique acting capabilities or should i say lack thereof make her perfect as an android and the other actors while terribly average are at least not terrible br br there is a plot a fairly intricate plot at that involving conspiracies and the lengths a couple one human one android will go to pursue their illegal romance with a big brother type figure and android assassin thrown in the mix the production and sets also were much better than i expected i haven't seen the original cyborg so i can't really compare it to much else granted this film is no blade runner but as a late night futuristic guilty pleasure its worth a watch,1
1828,turd pie br br take x2 franchises par boil for 5 mins stir in mixed cardboard characters non actors work best add 2 tons of clichés then bake in your plot hole microwave until bored serve with a sprinkling of dawson's crack not a typo br br voila money spinning brain rot for the emo world of generation br br looking for the keys in drain was the best bit br br aside from the first 5 mins its one of the worst films ever made br br utter utter nonsense,0
1829,what can i say not much to this one at all pretty dull and uninteresting br br the actors performances are just ok the only one that shines in any way is simmons but he only has maybe 3 scenes i understand that by keeping his screen time to a minimum he retains the mysterious psychic aura he has but i can't help but feel his talent was wasted no one else rose above mediocre br br the story itself seems like it may be intriguing at the beginning but then just doesn't go anywhere there wasn't a single scene in the movie that impressed me or made me feel like i had just seen something special the cinematography was fairly bland i mean desert in a washed out sort of sepia not very inspiring br br the story of his childhood pal back outta prison seemed only partially thought out and didn't really add anything to the story other than making an average 'twilight zone' script into a full length feature br br drab,0
1830,i will give it this it tried it did try to make it good and even got luke wilson involved luke wilson is good but he can only do so much he can't make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped br br the running gag with the bully was asinine he was never funny and i got tired of the gag really fast and the kid bit was kind of weak too he to florida yeah ok br br the movie felt like an average kiddie film at times with this underlining mantra adults stupid kids smart and that bit gets tiresome br br but the only moments that were funny was the police cart wilson drove around when he lost his squad car i loved that little cart especially when wilson turned on the sirens but other than that nothing else was worth my time d,0
1831,i really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by stephen king that i didn't finish i was truly disappointed it was the worst crap i've ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have a quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didn't have anything br br it's got this strange crazy science man with einstein hair the classic thing not real at all and a man keep getting younger all the time it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy too long movie with nothing exciting at all br br i give this movie 1 awful if they had like 5 i would probably take that instead it was a total waste of time,0
1832,on this site i've often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy but while they've never produced anything of the quality of towers' or 'the fall and rise of reginald they have also never to my knowledge made anything as bad as this the nadir of british comedy br br on my richter scale of comic awfulness it rates only behind the truly execrable 'are you being as the worst comedy show in the english language with bad acting annoying characters and humour that i'd grown out of before i left primary school unfortunately it was part of a large crop of shows back then along with 'dad's army' 'it ain't half hot mum' and 'allo that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catch phrases to keep audiences amused br br michael crawford proved later on that he's a talented performer but personally i'd rather be sentenced to a month of watching than endure a single episode of this drivel which makes me ashamed to be british,0
1833,the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w bush would do well to see this movie which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9 11 socio political landscape maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a they deserve it's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again they've clearly shown they have no sense of character br br what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism execution and murder self defense and patriotism his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create sound like any belligerent retarded yale cheerleaders you know of br br blows the slovenly off the screen as sympathetic as plight is it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine,0
1834,this looks so good on paper matt damon lawrence fishbourne jean reno nice right and a heist with 42 million sounds like a kick ass crime movie br br big disappointment i reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy br br but more than that it the pseudo reservoir dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong it's very much made for tv stuff br br all in all hugely disappointing it score points for being what it is but loses them massively for being bluntly not very interesting at all,0
1835,this is one of the great movies of all time the story is fascinating and the actors are convincing your really identify with the characters william wyler proofs with this movie that he is a great director his craftsmanship is unsurpassed,1
1836,well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that's even more boring than somersault the story is implausible the characters with the exception of and characters are unlikeable and wooden tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions happy and not happy and the sex scenes which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic would have been at home in a low budget porno flick br br this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema going that has had me on the edge of my seat ready to get up and leave br br the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster,0
1837,i liked this movie not because tom selleck was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semi over dramatized view of some of the issues that a baseball player coming to the end of their time in major league sports must face i also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in american and japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differently br br overall it is a good movie to watch on cable tv or rent on a cold winter's night and watch about the dog day's of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away a good movie for a baseball fan as well as a good date movie  trust me on that one wink,1
1838,i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater despite its local provenance and its relation to a hometown tragedy namely the beating death of eddie in 1994 i really have to come down hard on this movie the director for reasons best known to himself decided to shoot the entire film guerilla style with nonstop handheld cameras and cuts such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material which makes up the majority of the film a stroll down the sidewalk a brother to brother discussion on a sofa hell even a kiss on a first date are all shot style distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics besides the birth of mob violence we get anorexia alcoholism divorce racism parental abuse did i miss anything no doubt a better cast and a better focused direction would have knit these threads together as martin surely intended to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make just a sprawling mess martin i know you're from my town and i'm down with you man i really am just do a better job next time like you did in two plus one,0
1839,this is how i interpreted the movie first things first there was not a single scene in the movie where u see the bad guy taylor torturing or nailing ben's hands to the wall however the same cannot be told of the gals in the end too u see taylor disappear as he walks looks like the message there was there was no taylor and the whole movie was a figment of imagination of ben also there was no scene during the torturing moments wherein any of the gals confront or are in the same frame as ben it was taylor all the time but in real taylor was ben if they were two different people then why was there no scene showing both of them in one frame during the horrific times but of course before that u do see both of them together and that just be ben's imagination at work also when ben was out of jail the text on screen clearly says that ben's story was unrealistic and there was no such place as he had explained read mine cars etc even after liz hunter leaves kristy and comes back to find ben she doesn't find him why because ben taylor was out looking for the gals instead kristy has all the time in the world to check out taylor's ben web cam photos etc br br somehow everything sums up to just one fact that kristy and liz both of them knew that taylor was ben so my conclusion is that ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and taylor in one frame was nothing but figments of his imagination otherwise if there really was a taylor then they should have found him out given all the detailed explanation coming from ben,1
1840,when i first heard about greek i figured i would watch it because it sounded ridiculous another of abc family's so bad they're almost good shows but tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected br br as a member of a greek society i can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus and are also very fun to play with just on are own let alone to watch on a tv screen the opening scene to an only slightly dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there br br this isn't a show for over sensitive greeks if you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't so great about greek life then you'll spend the entire first episode and probably many other cringing and yelling but everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it it's nothing new but when it comes to college nothing ever is,1

1842,don't worry when looking at the cover of the dvd sandra bullock only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic the entertainment value here is very high br br to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to br br the doubled evil voices of the chief bad guys the special gun cam the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers the showy ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground the abundance of bottom up shots the spacey scene in which bullock falls unconscious on the street the over cliché italian mob guy moe the cheap synthesizer background music the mesmerizing overdone gun fetishism br br and last but not least the super corny fist fight scenes wish there would have been more of those br br extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud,0
1843,i'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story but from an unbiased stand point it's not very well done the film revolves around atypical angst ridden teenagers each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager we get to see a bit of each teenager's lifestyle but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind or the black and white interviews with the students there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie and nothing i needed to see yes it deals with some strong subject material and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well but the entire project seems unnecessary especially when it seems almost an exact replica to van sant's elephant one dealing with suicide the other with a school shooting as i said some people will probably enjoy this and the director writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it but i feel it's incredibly ineffective and when dealing with material that can be so easily clichéd to do something original with it i would not recommend this movie,0
1844,i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system but it doesn't even present a positive solution i guess i didn't feel really for the kids i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of if this comes on tv don't waste your time watch short circuit again for the time,0
1845,sings david in this movie but it is it's all about america so don't be ashamed to watch it just think if you can to prevent more damage you know you're just the same regular guy next door so be careful one of the best critics of common mind and friendship still don't care go for it for the music it's worth a try just close your eyes and pat and david bowie will touch you so deep you'll start to scream and while watching if you'll dare to open your eyes please don't do the popcorn stuff you're gonna miss quite a lot you may think that it's not worth but think twice and don't look at your neighbours lawn you never know what to find there is it worth try it just don't die or over it,1
1846,logan lerman dean collins iii of jack bobby fame provide a nice touch of familiarity as friends in this even if not maybe as close as they may be on jack bobby but the expressions of young students taking their stand for a good cause is very well expressed in this movie logan lerman may be seemingly typecast in roles of being different as thusly seen from here as is seen in this as well as in jack and bobby the movie also opens up with a very nice tune coined as a lost 45 and i'm wondering where the lions are a song which i'd always heard on the speaker my old job of and got it played on my local radio show of the hosted by barry scott but the last time of which i suggested this with this movie as it's dedication but the dedication was left out environmentalist demonstration is well expressed in this movie too for the protection of the ground owls as seen in this movie too what a hoot too this movie is hoot a hoot in the tradition of the owl commercials of the 1970s too truthfully stephen steve g baer a k a ste,1
1847,my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself br br 1 plants eating people have been done hundreds of times it's been used by nintendo in everything from mario to zelda to metroid prime it's been used in plenty of low budget 50's movies on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk i've known no one who walked out but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie i was one of them doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap br br 2 the characters easily could have been copy pasted from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck yet it's called characterizing when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clichés that hundreds of characters before have had don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs br br 3 this was not gory a guy cuts his skin off oh my not a guy gets his legs broken oh my gasp not i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick and she said i've seen pg movies worse than that why was it rated r so why was it rated r br br 4 here's the only plot the movie book has collage kids drink have sex get naked cruse bleed and eventually die this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap thoughtless horror movie yet people call this mature what the br br 5 i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind br br haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre easily the most diverse genre out there would do something well diverse something truly original br br i just wish more horror movies would have actual horror not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around br br 1 10,0
1848,it's not really about wine no real targets are those who would streamline and assimilate the peculiarities of local wine production for business purposes to this end he has made an excellent objective film spirited bumptious emotional and flawed independent wine producers are juxtaposed with media and auld europeans the art of wine making against market driven product manufacture it's an open show that doesn't lead conclusion br br film is occasionally infuriating to watch cameras are neither concealed nor steadicam by any means there are also plenty of captions as well as subtitles to wade through often too short a time on screen br br however it does outdo michael moore at the game moore can't play anyway the characters speak for and therefore condemn themselves well worth a viewing 7 10,1
1849,x is a beautiful adaption of herman melville's or the the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion the story is of downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epic br br i can't stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with 1 000 thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling i know i'm gushing here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film it's the best i've seen all year,1
1850,this is the worst movie in the world the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a is this for real sort of way it was so cheesy and low budget they should not have even bothered there was nudity and violence for the pure sake of having nudity and violence and the effects were just so so bad you would not believe it think ketchup as blood and cabbages for severed heads do not rent this,0

1852,what a self indulgent mess duncan roy's film is apparently autobiographical however it's impossible to find any glimmer of emotional truth in this chaotic badly acted and woefully amateurish fiasco br br in a way you have to admire the balls of a man who through grim determination and a very generous benefactor manages to make a film about his own rise and fall from abused working class lad to criminal english lord however the tone is either so self pitying or so arch that it's impossible to engage with either characters or plot the raw material is potentially great stuff however roy seems unable to tease out the kind of tale that should grab you by the throat then move you to tears and it's a complete mystery why it was ever made to be screened as a triptych of images presumably because a single image would have been too tedious to watch br br it's also interesting to see so many otherwise good actors bill nighy diana quick lindsay coulson giving career worst performances,0
1853,no lifeforce is not a great movie br br it's not a good movie br br it is however an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline and of course mathilda may it may actually be one of my favorite sf horror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires how often do you see that not even in alien the sf horror flick of all time does science come into the story at all in lifeforce they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable world br br now do i think it's successful no i think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one 'villian' and there are one too many road trips br br to be honest the movie is eye candy and fun to watch but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what hooper was trying to do and really create a strong scary sf horror movie br br if the remake does happen however i demand that mathilda may have a cameo,1
1854,i found this robin williams vehicle mildly amusing at best i guess you would call it a political satire of sorts it's about a political talk show host comedian who decides to run for president and unexpectedly wins i found most of the humour dry myself and robin williams is much more restrained and sedate than usual i would say the movie is more of a drama than a comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense i think the dramatic parts worked better than the comedy parts and the mystery and suspense aspect though that's a small part of the movie worked the best still i wouldn't rate this movie very high for me it was an ok waste of 2 hours but nothing special my best advice would be to catch it on tv cable or rent it cheap first before making a decision on whether to purchase my vote for man of the year is a 4 10,0
1855,basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way this movie is way more of a b movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons br br this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late and the budget for this one obviously went down again to save even more costs the movie got shot back to back with part 4 which i imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one br br it's just a typical b genre movie that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment it makes critters 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either the movie just falls flat as a science fiction horror comedy br br also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one they are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one br br the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby faced like he still does now i like watching this well known actors in their early roles it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days br br really a too silly and lame movie br br 4 10,0
1856,i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap but this is just sad i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur i was blown away it was the same damn movie with just some corbin spliced in it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word ninja written on their if you haven't seen them check out ninja terminator the thundering ninja black dragon and ninja warriors thanks roger corman you just made me waste a dollar,0
1857,i have not seen it since 1998 and yet i still can't get it out of my head or stop recommending people to find it so that shows what an impression it made br br just a wonderful story br br i just hope to see the stair at least once in person br br i didn't know much about mr petersen before this movie as i hadn't seen any of his previous works but his subtle acting in this impressed me and i think his portrayal of grissom on csi just shows more of the same he knows enough to let the character shine through instead of the actor shining through which makes him just that much better of an actor br br i can't remember enough about the poor accents to comment but i must say i have always enjoyed barbara hershey in all of her roles as well and i thought she also did a phenomenal job in this movie,1
1858,well let's be fair following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film i was actually shocked they got will patton to jump on board johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious turning down his partner brunette bombshell crystal in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double no such luck the cover of the dvd is hilarious they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film costar ellen actually puts in a decent performance as well but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment even one of the old bouncers or two or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice take this film out of your queue immediately,0
1859,betty is as an in a production of verdi's macbeth who is asked to go on when the diva is hurt in a car accident however in the grand tradition of the scottish play the production seems cursed with problems not least of which is some madman slicing up the crew unfortunately for betty the killer seems to have special plans for her br br this is one of several must see argento mad slasher flicks in this instance primarily for the extraordinary photography by the great british cameraman ronnie taylor i haven't measured it but i reckon around two thirds of the shots in this film involve either pans tracking or cranes the sheer amount of camera movement is just astonishing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller the imagery is wild and dizzying closeups of the heroine's eyes forced open with nails a swooping glide around an opera house from a point of view shots of the killer's brain squirming a bullet fired through a peephole a swallowed chain dug out of a victim's trachea conceptually it's just amazing and could only be realised by this director the movie isn't without some shortcomings though the cast are variable at best and are both a bit shaky and his dubbing in the english version is appalling even by italian standards although argento regular is fun and charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role that is more than a little autobiographical a horror director much maligned for his remoteness and reliance on technique the material is a nice three way mix of the phantom of the opera shakespeare and slasher flick scripted by argento and his usual collaborator franco with shifty suspects galore and the usual disdain for boring expository scenes to explain what's actually going on full of all sorts of different music brian claudio bill wyman and of course verdi the scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the in for some bizarre reason the uk print of this movie has the alternative title terror at the opera,1
1860,that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie not waste as in a waste of time any time spent with these characters is never wasted but waste as in a waste of opportunities br br when i see this movie i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose the setup was like an average television episode while the finish felt like the climax if you can call it that of the first movie br br nimoy in directing ii iv focused on the character of spock how he faced the kobayashi outside of the classroom and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh shatner could have done the same with kirk here but he didn't we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before again one of the novels would have been better try my enemy my ally for a very interesting character study of our friend james t the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits and the scotty uhura subplot seems way out of left field particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu uhura br br even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here sorry but it's true,0
1861,if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love was daft wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race a driven by julie by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in rides again' the movie is overlong and threadbare although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance a few funny bits and the cast's frantic mugging,0
1862,enchanted april was one of harry last movies he only directed a few more after this one he had made the maisie movies in the 1930s and 1940s in the opening credits it says from the novel by elizabeth and completely leaves off the author's last name rather odd but since it was von armin they may not have wanted the german association at the time sad to hear it was a flop when it was released with those fun names like frank morgan the wizard and jessie ralph who played w c fields' disapproving mother in law in bank dick two gals in london ann harding katharine alexander decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends but things don't go the way they planned reginald owen plays the husband with multiple personalities aside from a few funny moments it does move pretty slow ralph is the only bright spot here as the overbearing take charge type and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film the views of italy are all obvious backdrops the only saving grace here is that the turner classic version is only 66 minutes long too bad they didn't give frank morgan a larger role this was remade in 1992 by the bbc as a british film,0
1863,if you see the title a sex odyssey in the video store beware the cover has tori wells and three other 80's porn stars and has a copyright of 1986 if you're like me and i hope you're not you'll think 80's porn tori wells alright trickery it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars there's nothing inherently wrong with 70's german porn but it's not my cup of tea and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket i watched it anyway it's a bad bad movie sorry i guess i didn't really get past the rage,0
1864,what a waste of energy and money what a waste of what talent there was br br emilio estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout jon lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless harry dean stanton why bother and was it just me or can kari wuhrer barely act in this one br br the story was pretty non existent and really disjointed one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired like the surf dudes giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half how about that you never saw them surf once the set up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay off to make us give a damn nothing in this movie felt really true or genuine br br the only good things i can say is some very little of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting don't see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there,0
1865,while the movie has its flaws it brings to light some of the problems that come with living in a country that has no democracy it makes you empathize with the people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives their struggles and a potential leader san it makes one wonder why our government will interfere places we are not wanted yet ignore those who ask our help,1
1866,i can't believe i bought this movie on dvd i don't even remember it being shown on tv last year why in the world couldn't they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made damn and randy quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as jerry lewis i didn't know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated boy did i make a mistake if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation well at least i didn't pay more then 10 bucks for it maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records then again maybe not ps i still haven't watched it yet my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie the chronicles of riddick unrated director's cut woo freaking hoo,0
1867,i bought this film at blockbuster for 3 00 because it sounded interesting a bit ranma esque with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge i was 100 wrong br br having watched it i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly i don't usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort even the anti religious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightest it would be better just to listen to ray stevens' would jesus wear a rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg 13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this as if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream but they insist that zack and reba is worse br br it is but not in that way br br in a way this worries me the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides it's teenagers if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect then i have little chance of turning a story i've been writing into a pg 13 movie the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers i think it's number 2 so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it br br just say no to this movie though 2 10,0
1868,without a doubt one of tobe best epic great special effects and the vamp me baby,1
1869,as horror films go rest stop could have been better in many levels director writer john shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the backers several endings have been included in the dvd but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best br br the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop things get out of hand poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way br br it was clear when one started to hear amazing grace in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives br br watch it at your own risk there's a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre,0
1870,this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that have done br br it looks like a commercial from beginning to end the the whole time on a tripod it doesn't have pace rhythm it's illogical what a mess you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes and the ending wow br br spoiler br br jesus christ how the hell got shot are you serious worst scene of someone getting shot ever br br end of spoiler br br bad directing bad script bad acting really bad overall i wouldn't recommend this movie at all it's a waste of money and time,0
1871,first of all i'm not one to go all sappy over movies i saw friends in the 70's when it was first released i was about 17 years old at the time even now at age 50 i still can remember some of the scenes the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it the story is about innocence the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own i'm not surprised the movie and elton john's soundtrack are almost unknown today the music is beautiful it was unforgettable,1
1872,i have really enjoyed several movies by gérard depardieu and expected i'd like this movie a lot more than i did the biggest reason was that i just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny so it didn't hold my interest also although he does not sleep with his headstrong daughter the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky yes i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny in addition i really didn't like this little brat very much apart from her lies she seemed very sassy and self involved i would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her come uppance and somehow been punished as i just didn't like her,0
1873,utopia made in 1950 in france was the last film laurel and hardy produced with the bad reputation the duo have for their post 1930's productions i was expecting this film to be awful although admittedly it isn't up to the standard of their vintage comedies i was pleasantly surprised it's watchable and in parts genuinely funny and certainly the plot is of the same standard as you'd expect some gags are derivative from their earlier work but when you consider this film was their first for five years after their last hollywood produced film the bullfighters the routines are executed confidently as you'd expect from these professionals some scenes are not up to much but the value of this film is that some scenes are funny and as such absolutely priceless i particularly enjoyed the bedtime scene br br i felt sad at the end of the film our heros are left on their own desert island it's such a metaphor for the real life truth hollywood and audiences of the time had consigned the stars to a desert island of memories and that was to become last image they portrayed in film ollie died seven years later and stan died fifteen years later stan turned down an offer to appear in it's a mad mad mad mad world in 1963 what a shame that was a colour film only two years before he passed however his health probably wasn't up to much br br these boys are probably the greatest comedy performers of all time and although the movie is far from their true potential it's still an honour to watch them appear in film for the last time and touching on the echos of their towering talent,1
1874,this has to be my guilty pleasure i am a huge fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended anyone this move has no meat not substance no deep thought provoking scenes just plain old college kids having fun and if a few breasts have to be shown then so be it this movie is for when you just want to relax and not think viva la nudity,1
1875,shivering shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the our gang talkie era by now hal roach studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures and shakespeare is the happy result br br the gang is appearing in a version of quo vadis produced by kennedy the cop's wife the kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines among the funniest bits are kennedy the cop as the giant who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume and the terrible dancing girl played by director bob mcgowan's daughter br br several filmographies mention that shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie this may be true seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight buster keaton's brother harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies very funny and an early gang talkie classic 9 out of 10,1
1876,i saw this film on at the cambridge film festival br br the beagle's only in a couple of short flashbacks the whole thing is about darwin's life from to 1859 when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family 200 pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book br br the script is based on book annie's box annie charles's daughter died when she was 10 it is mostly a family drama but does include sex scenes however the participants are married both on and off screen not too exciting not much science but a well made film that's pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons a bit of a romantic weepie actually i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free thinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father br br some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he killed god but the viewer is able to doubt that what is beyond doubt given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadow bank well known before darwin and completely and the failure of darwin's prayers is that the idea of a kind god who loves his creatures is untenable br br i really cannot see many americans to it very much some may have problems with the title which is probably the most controversial thing about the film or with the fact that bettany does not have horns a tail and a pitchfork,1
1877,i hate football i hate football fans i hate cars but this film was the funniest thing i have seen in quite some time br br i was given the great opportunity to see this film at the weekend and all i have to say is i laughed till i cried and when is it going to be available in the uk and denmark girls this is one football film you will need to see its hilarious br br the fact that this film started out as some crazy commercial for a telephone company is just amazing the guys may not be well known actors but this is good down to earth real humour with real people and i for one applaud them for taking this to the screen br br well done,1
1878,this short was in part four of the short cinema journal a film i rented from netflix but which appears to have originally been a monthly film series for people who like mediocre modern short films and love to have the dvd chock full of commercials i have so far tried two of the dvds and felt enraged at the horrible way that a viewer needs to navigate the disk in order to see the films talk about an over produced and overly complicated way of doing this while i have and will continue to see as many shorts as i can i really doubt if i'll bother with the journals because of these factors br br now it could be that because i disliked the disk so much that i was not favorably disposed towards this portuguese animated short this is definitely possible however even if this is the case i feel that the other reviews were way too positive about this simple little film some of the artwork was indeed nice i liked how the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3 d environments as the camera went from a dull distant shot and dove into the city below this was lovely and took some work but as for the story about a cat who wants to go to the moon it just did nothing for me br br important update i saw this film again on a dvd entitled cartoon noir on 5 09 it was a pretty unappealing collection of art films however this time i saw the story of the cat and the moon with an entirely different audio track and boy did it make a difference instead of portuguese with subtitles it had a french accented narrator who spoke english in a film noir style while i usually hate dubbing this time it really made the film the narration of the portuguese version leaves a lot to be desired if you don't know the language or understand the subtleties unless you speak the language try looking for the other version provided you understand english,1
1879,if this is film noir then noir must be french for glacially slow take a cast of completely unlikeable characters give them nothing to say punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultra violence and you've got the formula for an aggravated dash could be subtitled sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown rip off bruce dern's one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick by the way i didn't like the film,0
1880,okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor joseph cotten whoring himself out for a buck mr cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead i know mr andrews was in the throes of alcoholism but why did cotten do this mess br br as for the plot it's a reworking of the frankenstein plot the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story then inexplicably they introduced a daughter this wasn't a bad thing until then out of the blue they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft core pornographic flick the change was dramatic and bizarre it was almost as if they said okay mr cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home now ladies strip br br the problem is that on every level the film is just awful except for the monster's makeup while not great it is still pretty cool to see but bad writing acting and a budget of 17 46 conspired to make this a drab and awful flick one so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there shouldn't be enough to entice anyone to see it,0
1881,this movie looked like it was shot with a video phone it had very little plot and unnecessary nudity the movie never really came together or made much sense and for a movie like this of course there were some unnecessary boob shots the director was obviously trying to make the movie subjective and different but it just never gave enough information on what was even really going on even in the end i was left with a mixture of anger and confusion confusion from the lack of plot and anger because i wanted my two dollars back from blockbuster and an 1 5 hours of my life back they should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie,0
1882,snowball express from the disney studios isn't quite as dated as some of their output from this era there are no hippies or hot rodders just dull as dishwater dean jones inheriting a ramshackle hotel ski resort from a deceased relative when jones and family pull into a sleepy colorado town the folks who give them directions looking like extras from deliverance are curiously vague about the hotel we expect it to look like a one room shanty but actually the accommodations are very nice jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face throughout which doesn't prevent one of the local yahoos from leering at her and of course clumsy pop dean jones is a regular on the slopes leading to a lot of pratfalls in the slush perhaps this square scenario might've benefited from some magical whimsy for this script is a frozen stiff from,0
1883,greetings from lithuania br br this is the first question that comes to head after watching this movie br br you know i saw a lot of bad movies in my life but after watching this one i only had two questions 1 is this was just a parody spoof br br 2 how could people create such a thing br br if you never saw this film than you really don't know what is a really bad film i mean bad the script are you kidding my acting is so horrible that i thing the actors where just having fun in this movie i know this is b movie but come on is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage br br oh and what an ending a must miss ending just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw wait until the ending because that kind of ending you have never saw before and i hope you will never see br br this movie at any cost and don't say i didn't warn you,0
1884,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i didn't go in with high expectations but as soon as it started i thought it might be o k it wasn't jim carrey seemed to try but he spoke all his lines as though he were some diabolic cartoon character the other actors all seem to try their best but are kind of wooden the plot has a good basis but the melodramatic lines make it dull and kind of stupid i was laughing during the whole second half of the movie and after five minutes of that i got tired of that most plot 'twists' you could see from several miles off it's just not worth watching i really wish i hadn't wasted my time with it,0
1885,sometimes i wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared if so then there's a sad future for horror movies dee snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified this movie does exactly this but not in a good way now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that snyder is saving this film from falling into a hole but let's be frank this movie didn't fall into a hole it was already in a hole and makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it when you finish watching this movie you are left sick depressed dirty and insane i have a feeling that was the intention of this movie what is lower than dirt,0
1886,when a friend once lambasted me for my first movie a pretty bad videotaped affair i argued that i could grow orson welles' first movie indeed was even worse he challenged me that it couldn't be so i pulled out the criterion laserdisc of i think citizen kane and played hearts of age my friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point br br there is a little humor in this short but it's basically as pretentious as and perhaps a collegiate answer to blood of a poet and other avant garde films of the time it is what it is a succession of images with a vague theme and unless you really enjoy any footage of welles in heavy makeup to boot this isn't really even worth tracking down,0
1887,i first saw this movie at a premiere party in mr hometown there between directors musicians and other norwegian celebrities i laughed and laughed i just couldn't stop if you like a comedy with black humor sharp lines and excellent acting this is one flick you have to see it's like mixing true romance with the wedding singer and add a dash of mad about you br br 10 points,1
1888,this is an entertaining surreal road movie it was written by joseph minion who also wrote after hours martin scorsese's excellent surreal film the film follows the adventures of a ten year old kid named gus who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like a tribute to luis film perhaps essex south lyndon in search of eight elusive game cards from various chimera company gas stations the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual like the money for instance which is like blank paper with numbers on br br most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip they tattoo him punch him but this doesn't stop the kid on his relentless quest some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance meat loaf flea also make appearances jack nance plays a motel owner who when he first meets gus tells him if you see any squirrels give them to me this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus 100 and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely if you're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies you'll like this an odd little gem of a movie,1
1889,there were but two reasons for me to see this film first of all stellan and marisa tomei were in it who are both good actors and i had nothing better to do while seeing the film though i immediately thought of something better to do sleep this film is a complete waste of time it is a standard ex cop flick the ex copper is the best there ever was but he was fired he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day all big surprises not go to sleep or if you have insomnia try this one br br 4 out of 10,0
1890,jumpin' this movie stinks it's a dull and listless drag that never lets up it's a wonder anyone even bothered to make groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his italian accent br br only harpo provides a grin or two and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co comic in frank albertson and the road gets even br br a real misfire,0
1891,abysmal indonesian action film from legendary triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as tom selick powerful at least the action is mindless and non stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and or meth addicts with no concept of reality one poor extra gets ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as i would rather trust a rattlesnake are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third rate voice actors random highlight some crazy dude eating live lizards movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls 2 10,0
1892,i'm a big fan of thomas harris i read all his novels at least 5 times and the book i really love the most therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both even if i hadn't read the book i'd still consider the movie as absolute average and i'd give it a five the creepy mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie when i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleep why was margot verger a very important character totally omitted why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money and most of all why was the psychological process starling went through in the end caused by the drugs lecter applied to her descended not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted too and totally changed well the reasons why jodie foster refused to play starling again are well known and i accepted it although like surely many others i'm very disappointed 'cause i identified starling with her for stories like red dragon the silence of the lambs or hannibal that possess such psychological depth it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen but as the germans say that's snow of yesterday ridley scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name jonathan demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the lambs he should have done hannibal too my only comfort is that i've seen the movie only two times it's long ago and thank god for that reason i'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone,0
1893,occasionally funny but generally boring i did recognize robert from welcome back carter aka epstein as the ex celebrity criminal there is a knee slapping gut busting scene with the french lady having a bad reaction to american food s baio s kellerman and tom arnold are billed but have only minor roles you never get to know the characters and it's hard to care what happens to them not recommended,0
1894,i disagree with the imdb com synopsis that this is about a bisexual guy preparing to get married it's more about all the crap we go through self induced and because of our parents that we have to get over when we grow up like the linda poem says childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in this movie is much more like a narrative poem it's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we inflict and experience over the years and how in the end it's all about love i'm not trying to be hyper sensitive or and finding and being with one special person,1
1895,sweeping drama with great sets costumes and performances  though some folks are channeling rhett scarlett melanie and even lady macbeth patrick swayze and james read are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location splendid villains  you'll want them all to come to a very bad end lots of strong female characters in this one  both good and bad secondary story lines also are well developed several cameos by major stars of past eras good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics br br curl up on a rainy day with your dvd or vhs player and drink of choice with this one a lap rug and a cat would be optional,1
1896,i saw this only because my 10 yr old was bored he and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies this is the first time i've strongly disagreed with ebert in many years there is not a single thing to recommend this film willis is good as always but the story stinks is unbelievable there is no real story no action no interesting cinematic sequences no surprises and worst of all the child star is a thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid by all means stay away and spare your child unless you want to punish him or her there is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer accordingly,0
1897,this is a gem of a film slapstick violence a plenty simon pegg and green spew br br a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this br br if you haven't seen this i can highly recommend it maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short br br if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film br br i didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts br br feeb 1 boiled egg,1
1898,this is an excellent documentary about rodrigues i enjoyed it very much it's very well put together and very informative if you want to know who is rodrigues i highly recommend you see this film the art of rodrigues br br,1
1899,the falcon the snowman offers some of the best acting from its two leads hutton in a brilliantly understated role calmly portrays the confusion and angst of a man who seemingly turns traitor for no other reason than as rebellion against his father penn as the co conspirator basically just along for the ride and drug money explosively turns in one of the strongest performances of his multi talented career,1
1900,if you like who dun its you will like this film considered the best italian detective story giallo fulci has done br br it's not mickey spillane for sure there are scenes designed to disturb anyone br br many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12 year old boy she was joking but she was naked nonetheless and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones she also tries to tempt the local priest br br young boys are turning up missing and there are several interesting suspects you have to watch carefully to discover the killer can you don't jump on the first guy it's way too early and he is too obvious br br anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer who died a violent death at the end what crazy reasoning he had,1
1901,dead man walking absolutely brilliant in tears by the end you can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises how can you justify killing whether it be murder or the death penalty and to what point is forgiveness possible not just in a spiritual way don't watch this film when your down but watch it,1
1902,pretty funny stuff charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this rather daring short about soldiers in the trenches of world war one daring because after all the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business br br the gags are amusing without being either hilarious or tear jerking one successful scene follows another as chaplin and his comrades try to sleep in a bunker that is knee deep in water that's where we got the term trench foot from probably the most ludicrous episode has chaplin disguised as a tree and foiling any number of german soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier caught behind the lines edna chaplin's main squeeze at the time is a woman who with the americans and is saved from execution too br br chaplin would go on to do funnier and more ambitious things but this is better than most of his shorts during this early period,1
1903,turkish culture is complete with lots of different cultures different cultures have different styles of music istanbul is like the mixture of turkey it has mostly the same language but different dialects this documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments you can watch with singers and groups their performances their daily life and learn their thoughts of music the movie includes not only the music of istanbul but the life in istanbul how people communicate and what they eat and drink the surprising part is although i live in istanbul i learned lots of things from this movie,1
1904,i had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on broadway with kathy bates in the lead i only saw one other play in the 1970's 1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did i really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when i learned that kathy bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film she wasn't well known off broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power i suppose and cast sissy spacek instead sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to kathy bates in any way i love anne bancroft but she seemed too young for this role the movie plot was true to the play anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind,0
1905,from the acting direction scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention br br dr suess is rolling in his grave right now what with the dirty ho s h i t and fake erection scenes etc etc etc its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t a greed greed and more greed br br compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into these guys should stick to making mtv videos how on earth this movie got 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me unless its the directors family,0
1906,i'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to season from the b grade to the hollywood but this movie was something different i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasn't to good compared to the shockers performance in hot boyz quite good and ice t in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt ice t kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice t and the other dude this kills the jamaican however ice t is unharmed very similar to ice's other movie urban menace which stars both of these actors were snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon when mj gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh with out blood and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide was a good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing a helmet and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was ok tho but me being from poverty i love hood films however if u don't love em like i do don't watch it only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genre br br nathaniel,0
1907,legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star conrad splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by ferdy mayne dies of a heart attack a bunch of drama school students steal corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for his grave writer director norman thaddeus vane concocts a fresh original and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise offers a neat evocation of the glitzy hollywood milieu and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga atmosphere the kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods with a gal being set on fire a juicy decapitation the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar b flick faces mayne has a deliciously eye rolling ball with his flashy role leon contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed up director wolfgang talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium mrs rohmer plus there are nice turns by luca as jerky drama student ringleader saint jennifer starrett as the sweet meg jeffrey combs as the geeky stu and scott thomson as the nerdy bobo popping up in cool bits are chuck porky mitchell as a detective patrick wright in one of his customary policeman parts and cochrane as a corpse joel king's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look the moody score by jerry mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot a fun little fright flick,1
1908,as much as i hate to disagree with the original poster i found asterix and the vikings quite good and a huge step above previous attempts at animating everyone's favorite br br for someone not familiar with the famous comic series the show would be hard to follow but for those of us in the know it's a pleasure to watch br br first and foremost the animation is far superior to earlier comic adaptations you can tell they took the time and effort to really recapture the look and feel of the comics this time around br br as mentioned there are elements of other asterix titles in the movie and i can see how fans of those titles might feel confused or a bit let down but i was so caught up in actually seeing one of my favorite childhood comics faithfully represented on the screen any qualms i had were minor by comparison minor spoilers follow br br asterix and his faithful friend travel north to rescue the nephew of their village chief who has been captured by the vikings the vikings think that by the boy teaching them about fear they will be able to fly thanks to some poorly worded advice from their village druid in the process the boy meets the viking chief's daughter abba and they fall in love etc etc etc if my explanation sounds convoluted don't worry the plot is easy to follow definitely a great buy you can purchase this dvd through amazon france but be warned your dvd player probably won't be able to play it i had to change the region setting on my computer to view it,1
1909,has a very unique story and i will never look at spirals the same way again not really spine tingling horror this film has a dark morose acid trip feel to it during certain parts was it just me or did you see vortex visuals the camera shots are interesting and the movie lets your imagination run wild the bizarre supernatural feel of this film draws you in just as the title suggests acting is done well and the town setting itself seems wrong with to begin with br br this may take a few viewings for it to sink in a great trippy film,1
1910,this movie wasn't good i thought it'd be a cute disney movie just like the original wrong it was awkward for christina ricci whom i expect so much more than this you could just tell by watching i think doug e doug did the best he could sit 5 year olds in front of the this any older and they might start to fall asleep,0
1911,couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door if they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die do they push the button br br this is an odd film based on a richard matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair the trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director richard kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones at times it seems like it with talk of moral choices damnation and the afterlife is it a science fiction film possibly there are lots of questions about that mars project and what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy is this invasion of the body snatchers or a demonic take over film don't know maybe and that's the problem there are lots of questions most of them intriguing but there are too many little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude even in an open ended way i'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer kelly fills his script with simply too many that director kelly can't handle or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit it made me crazy i won't get into the two leads cameron diaz and james marsden who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting br br it's a heady mix that doesn't work there are ultimately too many holes i got to the end and suddenly realized i had no idea what i just saw i really didn't like it but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather i'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything,0
1912,this film does not have the outstanding visuals that american beauty or the ice storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of american beauty br br the story has some similarities with the ice storm in particular as well as sigourney weaver without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much at times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs here the writing cannot measure with that of american beauty but that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like said music score and expectable given the cast effective performances of note is emile hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding into the wild br br overall i can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must sees which would be topped by 1 american beauty 2 the ice storm 3 little children br br after you've seen and liked those check out this one,1
1913,this is a ravishing yet spare adaption of thomas mann's novelette of the same title dirk bogarde gives his finest screen performance he himself believed so the dialogue is minimal so his face must register the nuances of his anguished character a composer a writer in the novelette the only major alteration who travels to venice in 1910 visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty it's passing and the whiff of decay beneath trained as an opera director visconti blends music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since the leopard another stunning film which greatly influenced coppola's sicily in the godfather,1
1914,i must in light of the of praise for this flick from viewers assume once again the role of the turd in the punchbowl as lowell used to say i am scratching my head at the sheer number of laudatory comments the african queen this ain't the period flavor is wonderful yes the acting is fine but no actor no matter how great can bring life to the seemingly endless stream of perfectly tedious and insignificant party and dinner table conversation here and i care not how much of it is taken from joyce's text imagine spending an hour and a half as a fly on the wall at a christmas dinner of a not particularly interesting group of people it's not clear to me that it's a family as one person suggested having to listen to their mundane table talk and you have the essential experience of this movie absolutely nothing happens and nothing important is said but it is said at interminable length as i said the popularity of this movie is a mystery to me speaking of mysteries watch a good one rather than this,0
1915,this is one of the best horror suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes a lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for you i have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax i myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way,1
1916,this version of mansfield park while being extremely accurate to the novel lacked the compassion i felt for fanny which is crucial and central to this jane austen story this was due to the total lack of acting ability by the actress le she had no appeal and at times appeared to be either lost in space or out of her depth the scene she has with her uncle where she breaks down in hysterics was hysterical she badly overplayed that crucial scene and i actually felt sorry that henry crawford ever cared for her br br the polar opposite is the portrayal of mary crawford by jackie smith wood what a wonderful actress in a very difficult part to make that character witty and self centered selfish yet vulnerable to love br br i have always loved fanny she is mild mannered but with an implacable sense of what is right and who she thinks is worthy of respect and admiration the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series as much as i wanted to like this fanny i just could not br br i suggest skipping this version of mansfield park for the real thing the novel fanny will not disappoint you will love her,0
1917,br br this movie sucked the first one was way better no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better killjoy in the woods come on give me a break i'm suprised friend the blair witch didn't show up to make a cameo bad acting bad story and just plain out silly and boring don't waste your time,0
1918,i am a big fan of british films in general but especially gangster movies unfortunately this film was shockingly bad i think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews the idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable i have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been glorified with over the top violence etc the only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the range rover murders where some overblown bouncers got rubbed out for messing with people they could not handle this film is a disgrace to british cinema it has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent gritty and realistic as some people like to put it the sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence,0
1919,george barry is a genius death bed the bed that eats is a prototype for much of the fiction and camp surrealism that is so chic now truly innovative maverick and just effing brilliant hyper strange acting subtly nightmarish atmosphere i recommend reading stephen book nightmare usa there is a chapter devoted to barry and death bed the bed that eats available from fab press on a related note death bed the bed that eats and beyond dream's door make a perfect double bill furthermore it's trite and tired and ultimately stupidly ironic to criticize a low budget cult film for being made' or inept ' the b movie aesthetic is part of these films' charm no amount of cgi could duplicate the cumulative effect death bed the bed that eats has on the viewer with an advanced palate,1
1920,if you're a fan of jackass viva la bam or the videos then you already know what you're in for but this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original and man does this movie pack a mean low blow but i mean that in a good way it's the same type of death defying gut wrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from bam knoxville and co but this time with even more laughs than ever before with johnny insane tolerance for pain bam love for harassing his friends family and steve gross out factor you have one hell of a funny film the bar for the stunts skits and general mayhem of the jackass crew has been raised jackass 3 doubtful because it's nearly impossible to improve on perfection,1
1921,as with so many modern us films there has to be a supernatural element to the plot but if you just let that go this is a tale with heaps of charm and a kindly heart cased in a crab shell br br we are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressed area struggling to find anything to be happy about beau bridges' character is really up against it with a family on the increase a nil bank balance and a brother in law who's sold out to a big business chain which he secretly hates but in which he is willing to rub nose d'onofrio finds his rather surface bubba lifestyle cramped by having to look after his baby brother joey and is itching to escape the shackles of this dead hick town their boss's business is closing down much against his will because of a lack of new customers and he is haunted by memories of his father as he builds up the tension towards his own attempt at self destruction br br joey who had seemed to personify the curse on their lives is lost at sea believed drowned in a freak accident his miraculous restoration to them by the portuguese whose boat they had just built and launched perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew is the sign they've been waiting for and they all decide to give life one last throw of the dice br br there is a beautiful brooding mood throughout this work which excelled in holding our attention as brilliantly as 'the shipping news' there are other parallels with the later work too which lead one to suspect a touch of a remake i like of life' for its simpler less contrived story and star performances from actors working at their craft rather than to be noticed as stars,1
1922,this film simply has no redeeming features the story is incomprehensible and the script is gross sadistic and stupid the sex scenes are a joke as is the inevitable car chase the music is awful the acting is limited largely to growling and smirking a half star dud shame on directv for putting it on pay per view in a theater people might well have thrown soda at the screen,0
1923,i think this is one of the best movies of all time i just think it shows realistically what romance and especially black romance is all about would love to know what others think as well the acting was just out done where is tate anyway it has been awhile since i have seen him in anything however i think he has out did his acting performance in this movie,1
1924,the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is a car chase in here and a dandy it is aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him it is rare that a second or third tier actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries a film usually such a role is given to an a list actor with box office draw which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as we're used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb and or meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type soundtracks a villain that hams it up and repeatedly a cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25 this is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release 1 2 of 4 stars,1
1925,having read all of sarah waters books i was eagerly looking forward to a bbc adaptation of especially since tipping the velvet had been done so well by old familiar andrew davies br br i was not disappointed with the results in fact i think this might be on a par with both romantic and entertaining and not as so many ignorant people would have you believe a pointless lesbian romp having been a fan of elaine cassidy's since seeing her guileless turn in journey i thought she embodied both hard deception and a growing fragility as maud her transformation was believable and impressive to watch i recognised sally hawkins as zena blake from tipping the velvet a small role primarily so i didn't have as many expectations but she was astounding in the role of sue trinder her eyes were mesmerising conveying everything from rage to absolute despair the two of them acting together combining these talents made this drama unmissable of course imelda staunton was amazing as usual she is unmistakably a national treasure and the supporting cast were all of a high standard even the direction from the fairly unknown aisling walsh used contrasting yet beautiful shades of blue for briar and brown for london br br however as much praise must be given to the script writer to turn a 600 page book where every line is of the highest quality into a three hour extravaganza is a huge feat he illuminated the main revelations at a steady pace whilst giving us plenty of back story and character development at the same time he has my full admiration br br in conclusion a brilliant adaptation where all involved gave 100 and making this one of the best bbc dramas i've seen,1
1926,this film is terrible honestly the acting is terrible the script made me cringe the effects are completely lousy which i usually don't mind for older films but this was made just two years ago and everything about it just annoys me a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son of course before that it has the cliché you really believe that ha ha ha it's just a story routine dragged out for a while the witch's cannibal son was made a retard i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy but this film failed at both it has minimal gore and no nudity which made a bad film even worse heck the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene and even that could of been better br br honestly don't even waste your time watching it on cable and certainly don't consider buying or renting this else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining,0
1927,i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it i scored it a 1 in the vote tally i am grading this not even as a regular film but as a t a film and this is the worst lamest crappiest and most awful movie i've seen the acting story and music are all terrible not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the t a it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers avoid this piece of trash at all cost this is the worst of bad 80's teen cinema,0
1928,it may be a little creaky now and it certainly can never have the impact it once had but this is still a thrilling reminder of what michael jackson could once do looking back on it now for the first time since its initial prominence i was struck not by the horror trappings quaint but fun and vincent price has never sounded so genuinely un sic menacing than its absorption of the horror film allowing jackson behind genre and make up to give us a bravely revealing portrait of male sexuality br br because thriller isn't really about horror in the way horror isn't really about horror it is about that age old theme the sexual awakening of a young woman the film opens in a cinema with jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the imagery and the aggressively gendered response of course she is on a date and she is less scared by the film than what she knows will be expected by her boyfriend br br the mainstream imagery of the film they watch the group atmosphere all suggest the socially conditioned expectations this leads her not only to think of the body in disgust hence all the decaying ghouls the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend but her peers her society hence its as a gang violation br br this is brilliant disturbing stuff the best thing director landis has ever done jackson the most popular artist on the planet was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained multitudes not all of them reassuring the song itself has held up remarkably well the creepy insistent bass rhythms the extraordinarily salacious lyrics the beautiful 70s disco ecstasy tailing the chorus shattering timelessness revealing the milky desire behind the fear,1
1929,possibly the worst movie i have ever seen pathetic in almost every way br br i threw the dvd straight in the bin i didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop br br the effects are beyond a joke the dam control room looks like cardboard the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds nothing works br br then there is the limp plot about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon br br i couldn't wait for them all to drown,0
1930,i was happy to find out that at least now this movie is beginning to get the appreciation it deserves just view those votes not top class action like die hard or lethal weapon but still something like a solid 7 out of 10 fine script good actors with working chemistry and a director who knows what he wants sadly this was director harlin's last good film deep blue sea managed to reach 'an ok rollercoaster status but cutthroat island and especially driven are well deserved flops personally i think the turn off at the box office might have been the woman as an action star theme well give her a chance because davis does deliver a performance above par and after all this film doesn't concentrate so much on the feminine side but instead on good ol' action jackson as a sidekick is given a lot of room in here plus his share of action and about a thousand killer wisecracks and on the plot from shane black the writer of lethal weapon and the last boy scout the latter of which as a movie is on very many levels much like this one the theme the clever plot also as good and as underrated overall if one hasn't seen this one yet don't forget to rent it for the next quiet saturday night,1
1931,i got this on a double feature dvd called scream theater and it's no doubt one of the most terrible movies i've ever seen and i've seen some really bad ones school's out and of three girls who if they're teenagers i'd eat my hat are talking about non stop party so of course they all go to the house of the girl whose parents are the most strict for a slumber party meanwhile a psychotic has escaped the local bug house where one girl's father works is on the loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wide open eyes i guess that's to show he's bonkers of course since he has a bone to pick with that particular doctor off he goes to his house the location of which is apparently common knowledge in the meantime some dumb jock types are slamming down beers and out to scare the girls and of course the loony shows up too and starts cutting throats and that's about it as the heavy metal music chugs along in the background or maybe that's not it but really that's all you need to know unless you spend your time perpetually stoned or drunk you'll find little of interest here and even if you are wasted most of the time you'll still probably find your intelligence insulted 1 out of 10,0
1932,this is actually a brilliant movie the story is grotesque but the actors are brilliant especially the performance of mads as is magnificent it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken if only more people understood danish this could be a great candidate for an english version it is also worth mentioning ole who always delivers that extra twist to the plot with his slightly mad character i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience also take a look at adams 2005 a movie by anders thomas jensen also with mads accompanied by a well playing ulrich thomsen,1
1933,i first saw this short when i bought a random dvd of short films a while ago this is the only short on the dvd i liked but i don't just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and passionate no bells no whistles it could have been done with a but don't get me wrong the animation is elegant and insightful this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats but it is simply black and white and then there is writing and the music it is simply beautiful br br i eat chocolate drink wine and watch it over and over again br br nothing else matters i wait for pedro to come up with something else,1
1934,all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid it is pretty boring and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff a couple exchanging nods over their good a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes sits down and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace quadruple takes or more when people look at things solitary banjo tuning and playing taking a break for a beer telling a joke to a fawn about a big mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies complete with many big mouthed expressions which are needed for the weak punchline the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire lots of seemingly stock footage close up shots of animals birds insects and spiders in the woods br br the movie starts with a forest fire then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe the killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands br br if it's true that the movie in the version available on the out of print videotape is cut perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut it deserves another look on dvd otherwise it's simply not very interesting and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors slasher fan,0
1935,i live in mexico city so i have to suffer the trailers for every piece of trash that comes out from all these stupid mexican filmmakers you want to admire a mexican guy for making great films take a look at something by guillermo del toro specially the devil's backbone or maybe alfonso cuarón though i really don't like his films but i respect them br br mexican filmmakers often produce some of the most terrible utter trash ever por la libre el segundo aire american visa but this is one of the lowest points in mexican films ever if you respect your brain please avoid this piece of at all costs it would be more intelligent to watch some video of a wedding or to watch britney's reality show that's got more iq than everyone in this 'film',0
1936,i am surprised by the relatively low rating this film has it is a screwball comedy romance film rolled together by someone besides billy wilder but it does a really good job even won an oscar br br it is ingrid bergman's first film in the us since the 1950's even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely this film proves she had multiple talents beyond her good looks br br goldie hawn who won an oscar in this her first film as supporting actress is very good as the modern sophisticated yet quirky latest mistress to dentist playboy love them leave them walter goldie is delightful to all the senses in this role which with a great cast set her up as a slam dunk for this early career award br br this film is not real deep but is a gem that has stood the test of time very well not sure why it's average is so low as i give it a solid 8,1
1937,i finally got hold of the excellent dvd of this film which is loaded with interesting extras i have read quite a lot about it and i unfortunately missed it at the stockholm film festival it doesn't quite deliver as i thought it would but it is still worth watching if you like strange and unique movies i much rather watch this again than any of the recent so called horror films vomited out of hollywood these days what detracts from the experience for me is certain music cues which sound dated and rely too much on cheap synth sounds for me all these tonal harmonic elements of the score could have been lifted out and replaced by david excellent sound design but that is just my opinion otherwise this is a daring angry picture with welcome meditative and poetic parts like the fading of the photograph sequence which is beautiful i look forward to seeing ascension and i applaud mitch and for their efforts in producing non mainstream cinema they are a great inspiration as i soon embark on my own short film production,1
1938,you know those movies that are so unspeakably bad that you have to laugh half caste wasn't one of them which sounds good right but no it's not it's not a bad attempt at a horror movie that's fun to watch because it's lame or not well acted or has bad special effects or anything else like that no half caste is just plain boring they don't even make an attempt to be scary until the last 20 minutes are so it's just kids running around in the african bush country and getting high off of elephant dung for the first 75 of the movie and it's not even funny the last 20 minutes though are hilarious i have no idea what happened but it was really fun to watch that cgi leopard rip out the throats of all of those white guys i couldn't tell apart anyway if you're in the mood for a bad horror movie don't rent this one because you'll go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff if you do accidentally rent this movie i'd recommend fast forwarding to the end and skipping any scene that happens in daylight you won't miss anything you won't have any idea which character is which or exactly what is going on even if you do watch all of the back story,0
1939,jack frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with super loaded with margaritas how's that for a plot the film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with bbq tongs and are impaled by carrots you might even say the whole movie is skating on thin ice ba boom tish br br admittedly there are some fantastic one liners including a remark about the murderous coconut shark br br fair enough times are hard but that does not excuse the willingness of the actors to take part in such utter tripe br br for those fans hoping to see jack frost be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot creeping up the beach with corny voice over commentary,0
1940,when i first saw this show i thought to my self what is this its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered huge then there's sadie this complete misfit for her friends and well her family shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals like what is that also they made her another lizzie clone yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that,0
1941,this moving was intriguing and absorbing however the story was a little choppy and hard to follow at times although the two principal actors did a great job just seeing penn acting with every fiber of his being and stealing every frame made this a very memorable movie later movies have revealed him to be a not just one role actor he also showed comedic flair in sweet and lowdown surprisingly talented and not the light weight i used to think he was,1
1942,star rating unmissable very good okay you could go out for a meal instead avoid at all costs br br the tale of the titular adam mark o' halloran and paul tom murphy two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years br br i know a lot of irish people like to drink but it seems some of them have problems with heroin too by the looks of this movie i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there like there is in many parts of the world so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing br br i don't recall the last irish movie i saw the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately and judging from that obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be the film is rather funny in certain parts but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near the knuckle laughs the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to and fro in light of this some may find the ending sad others may see it as just desserts br br overall i just failed to see the point to the film i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way unlike trainspotting which dealt with similar themes it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day,0
1943,great story great music a heartwarming love story that's beautiful to watch and delightful to listen to too bad there is no soundtrack cd,1
1944,i couldn't believe the eye candy from start to finish being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold there are so many rich full images that are put before me that each and every time that i see this movie i find something new that i had not seen before as with previous movies that i have seen such as blade and mystery men also by former music video directors the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well though the characters could have been developed better the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection even if you haven't seen this on the big screen you won't be disappointed i know i wasn't,1
1945,personally i don't like a lot of b w movies but there's something magical about this movie br br the movie starts with elizabeth lane barbara stanwyck liz writes a magazine column about how she's the of connecticut of course she's lying this becomes a problem when her publisher mr yardley asks her to play host to a navy sailor over christmas in addition mr yardley who's going to be alone for christmas invites himself up to the farm for the christmas party from there things just go crazy br br since the movie is set on a new england farm the movie has a warm holiday feeling plus the characters are hilarious mr yardley is always shouting orders and liz's friend felix is always yelling ' when things go wrong finally the movie ends the way a christmas movie should end a jolly fat man laughs and shouts what a christmas br br in short no matter what age you are you will love this movie,1
1946,enjoyed http ow ly my wife didn't so i watched it in bits over a few days br br reviewers mainly confused most agree it's allegorical but not of what br br that most people don't wish to escape and it's essentially forbidden goes with most of those options br br so presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation prejudice fear onto it br br so i'd say it's about an a life a live desaturated of colour literally in the film figuratively in the interpretation,1
1947,there are few movies that have the massive amount of non stop ninja action as ninja iii the domination this is a story of love redemption and revenge however this is mainly a story about flipping out and killing people for no reason at all if you've been searching for a movie where a ninja goes absolutely nuts and takes all kinds of people to their graves just because he's a ninja and he can do it this is the movie for you i can't think of any movies to compare this to because no movie is this awesome wait oh have you ever seen the thing with two heads there is a part in that where the titular thing is riding around on a motorcycle and about a million cop cars are chasing it them around but they keep crashing and what not because you can't catch the thing with two heads well that is kind of what ninja iii is like i highly recommend this film especially if you like the following things ninjas swords lucinda dickie from breakin' and breakin' 2 electric boogaloo video games about being a bouncer in a bar ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas,1
1948,darr is a great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has a major crush on her and is constantly stalking her i have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will i forget the line i love you k k k kiran br br it's just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren't exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make a fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic i still think he did a great job of playing it and can't possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in br br juhi what can i say she looks especially amazing in this film it's not that she doesn't always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public a wonderful image of her br br as for the music it was excellent especially teri one of my all time favorite songs i also thought tu mere was quite nice also br br a must see for everyone overall darr deserves a 9 10,1
1949,no bullets no secret agents a story that is entertaining funny and believable met some of the producers actors in this film at the theater they seemed as interesting in person as their characters on screen you may not hear about this movie on tv with high dollar ad spots but it is definitely worth checking out i have spent 8 for a movie ticket on a lot of other movies that weren't this entertaining looking forward to future projects by this production company,1
1950,a holiday on a boat a married couple an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning br br i like boobs no question about that but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim my anger just rises to a whole new level take two guys a husband and another man put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them ad a deserted island subtract all her moral issues ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this br br the acting is i would say good there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see the main female character makes me sick this is due to her lack of moral values the man with the most fish get's her attention even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with manuel the other man because i must do it to survive how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is away and he won't even benefit from it the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does if she doesen't get approval for her actions she's a victim br br i recommend everyone to see this movie this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience,0
1951,the production company for this film calls itself entertainment' and that is a surprisingly apt name this very is very entertaining from start to finish which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting every time a low budget zombie movie is released it will tend to be for the fans by the fans i do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies but too many more like this one and i'll be re evaluating my opinion the film seems to be a rip off of the half decent aussie zombie flick expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat everyone is wearing one but this doesn't make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times the credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we're going to be in for an atmospheric film but when the movie starts properly it soon becomes apparent what we're actually in for naturally there's a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done though the good things i have to say about the film pretty much end there there's a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was overall this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies i don't recommend it,0
1952,there are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be box office failures an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that for once an indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience and not churned out a kader khan type stereo typical hoax the movie is about two guys who dream of riches and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter a humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story the complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot aamir khan plays the a street smart guy while salman khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy the villian played by paresh rawal and his henchmen junior and make you laugh in your sleep although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies despite shoddy camerawork and despite being loud at times it remains one of the scarce funny movies bombay has come up with after movies like and other movies it is sad that it didn't do well at the box office for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned,1
1953,usa's azn tv purchased the rights to this film and the network is showing it using the english title the pickpocket br br 1997's the pickpocket takes amateur home movie style movie making to amazing levels of unpleasantness the movie depicts a long winded series of boring wanderings of an uninteresting confused guy this lead character xiao wu does not simply walk about aimlessly viewers will unfortunately soon realize that xiao wu has an unsurpassed talent to seek out and remain dormant near the most obnoxious noises to be found in china clanging empty tin buckets being beaten with a stick he is there every old motor in china clunking in agony he is there a crying baby yes you guessed it he is there according to the pickpocket china is the most irritating unpleasant sounding place on planet earth br br the only element worse than the sound of the pickpocket is the photography the camera shakes shakes and shakes some more finally the camera stills but then it falls to the actor's knees and just stays there until someone in the crew realizes the mistake and begins to shake the camera again most of the shaky film is framed in distant long long long shots the few times when the camera gets somewhat close nothing compelling ever takes place to connect the viewer with what is happening br br the photography is murky faded and often blurry the use of color is well there is no sign of intelligence controlling the use of color most every shot is held 20 times too long few movies are so painful to sit through this film is painful to watch and painful to hear and then it simply ends br br john woo fans might enjoy being able to hear part of the soundtrack to die xiong the killer as the lead character is hanging outside of a video store for many minutes anyway be warned the pickpocket will steal away your good time,0
1954,before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema 1 your average completely uninspired fare i e constantine and 2 the work that is charmingly bad or so bad it's good a la manos the hands of fate now that i've seen dr gore i know there is a third kind of bad movie the utter crap sandwich that will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory a work that is mind bendingly execrable anathema br br i have hated certain films before but i've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its hold and became self loathing have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it but makes you grieve for another hour after that mystery science theatre disciples beware this is soul sucking cinema go rent circle of iron or the killer shrews instead,0
1955,this documentary was very amateurish it could have been made by college students assuming that it was my grading is as follows content c sound quality f cinematography f acting d soundtrack f casting c a overall grade d br br i found myself getting seasick as we walked down the streets with the characters bobbing up and down with each move of the my mother in law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialog extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb these students would barely pass my course my advise don't waste your time or money for the one a,0
1956,robert altman nicolas roeg john luc goddard you were expecting a fun film the entire family could enjoy these and other directors were obviously chosen because they have not followed the mainstream but created it for those that complain that they did not adhere to the original story of the opera how often does the music in a film directly relate to what is going on in the film it is the mood that counts this is what i believe the directors of these movies were doing creating a contemporary mood for old operas for the most part they succeed wonderfully with all these operas who is going to like them all we could have used more beverly br br finally what is art even opera without a few naked women,1
1957,this outlandish troma movie is actually a very good movie it is known as their epic and best and most highly rated production their version of shakespeare's play is extremely funny with the usual dose of troma nudity and gore troma has made some very good gore films one of my favorites is street trash and of course the toxic avenger movies i have one troma movie terror firmer which has a reputation as their goriest and nastiest movie i enjoyed tromeo and juliet so much that i need to finally watch terror firmer this is a 2 disc collector's version with four commentaries and many many features tromeo and juliet is an absolute hoot and highly recommended,1
1958,based on a stephen king novel needful things provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat a mysterious man max von sydow comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in maine von sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen also starring are ed harris and bonnie bedelia harris is steady and bedelia is deserving of your attention also in support are j t walsh and amanda plummer not the best nor the worst adaptation of king's horror on the screen,0
1959,the muppet movie br br directed by br br james frawley br br kermit the frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together br br the muppets star in their first feature film bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture the story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts the well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction the cameos aren't just thrown in either but written in as interesting characters making one of the many peaks for our furry friends,1
1960,1 i've seen hamlet branagh is too old speaks frequently with a high pitched voice unwillingly funny not a convincing hamlet and his directors qualities poor see also much ado about nothing from branagh the funny parts of the dialogues have mostly been cut out not speaking of the directors mistakes in the dialogue cuts 2 i've seen hamlet 2000 i think the scenario is an interesting idea but such lousy actors all of them 3 orson welles hamlet is ok but this bbc hamlet is the best jacobi is convincing seems a bit of a lunatic very suitable and patric stewart wonderful and claire bloom is a very attractive queen you believe those actors what they are saying i think this is the best compliment,1
1961,the decline series is amazing and director ps can't get enough credit for making these movies i'm slightly surprised to see that not very many people have seen this one or the other two but their worth unearthing if you want the picture of punk in the trans formative years between the late seventies and early eighties the film starts out with a blistering collection of clips played over music from the band x many interviews with bands and that offer an enlightening perspective as to what surviving was like on the low rung of the mainstream rock ladder no internet crappy jobs and all out hostility collide in this genre for new kids who haven't heard of these bands or are just starting one themselves this movie is a true lesson in how to rock all the band performances and there are many are awesome especially fear who never cease to amaze me this and the second installment are amazing time capsules offering those who care a rare glimpse into the lives of these crazy people it's true punk like in the interview with darby girlfriend when their recalling a painter who mysteriously suddenly died outside their house and it took a week or so for them to figure it out they take pictures next to the guy and everyone including the had a chuckle on this one and in true form the interviewer asks the girlfriend if she was sad or upset that this guy had died while painting their house the response no i hate painters how about black flag renting their apartment rehearsal space for 16 dollars a month my jaw almost fell off at that moment seeing as i'm renting a ten by ten closet to practice in for 400 between watching this and deadwood i feel like i was born in the wrong time period just missing those cowboy days and nights of the old way the people and bands associated with the movie paved the way for what harder music today is and they did it in their own unique way brilliant film ten stars see part 2 as well its equally awesome part 3 though i don't know what to say about,1
1962,disney like entertainment with some un disney like moments of graphic violence and sexual references lousy comedy alongside cliché ridden moralizing noah as abraham lot as his wicked buddy laughable special effects overdone acting with bad timing and were destroyed before the flood strange twists and too many sub plots the bible doesn't mention god as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster br br b movie wannabee director john irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction,0
1963,john huston actor and director better known for more robust fare such as the misfits and african queen directs his daughter angelica huston in what would be his last film indeed the film was released after huston's death based on james joyce's novella of the same name the dead tells the quiet story of a new year's celebration in 1904 dublin huston his cast and his screenwriters including his son tony have created a gem of a movie the novella is among joyce's finest works as well as being the only one that is filmable the film is a tribute to huston's genius he has taken a small beautiful story and has made a small beautiful movie donal mccann and angelica huston shine although shine is too showy too flashy a word to describe their quiet understated performances the dead reflects the huston family's love for ireland and is in its own quiet way a fitting final movie for a legend,1
1964,great music but ain't these people pathetic a true period piece of the trippy sixties and it left me depressed the director paints the wrong side of the life and it stings as a nest if the culture of the time led people to do these things it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery only despair i tried really tried to like this film but these people aren't anywhere on my page yes it would be nice to see the world go away for awhile but i always plan to come back drugs aren't the cause of these characters' downfalls it's their lousy attitudes  these guys passionately drink their cup of poison they cheapen their lives and in the end cheapen the journey that is life has romance ever been so dark br br cheers interesting scenery wonderful soundtrack by pink floyd br br caveats dated drugs depressing thoroughly unlikable characters they aren't flower children br br only for the curious since most packages swoon the pink floyd connection rare floyd tracks many will have never heard before as fm ain't what it was br br rating two stars,0
1965,much more than any other film from that period night of the demons represents the brainless and hugely enjoyable horror pastiche it's undemanding fun with loads of nasty make up effects gorgeous looking and horny teenagers and adorable cliché elements a group of party animals led by the alternative angela goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend it all starts out typical and innocent with dancing drinking and the occasional flirt between youngsters that can't keep their hormones under control but pretty soon a bloodthirsty demon possesses the hostess in the most ingenious ways you've ever seen the rest of the cast gets slaughtered viciously only to return as hideous creatures prowling for blood the thing that makes this film better than most cheesy 80's horror films is finds a good balance between light headed camp and atmospheric horror some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone director tenney makes great use of the set pieces coffins a crematorium endless dark and his young enthusiast cast obviously love what they're involved in the terrific make up effects by a whole team of artists and designers are of course the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of severed limbs poked out eyes and crushed skulls the ultimate highlight however is linnea quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick this nymphomaniac bimbo shoves an entire tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder spree terrific night of the demons received two sequels during the 90's and although they're still definitely worth checking out they focus more on comedy than chills,1
1966,usually when i don't see a show on an original run i find it later on cable and realize it's a gem the gimore girls is one of those rare exceptions i'm glad i missed it br br i truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling stupid boring banter this is one hour of just that the mother made me wonder if she is bipolar and off her lithium she never stopped talking every minute every second talking to every person she interacted with worse yet her speech is childish and soooo like valley girl she talked about guys her hair her mother her clothes like what's the for situation i've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series it's not a comedy it's not a drama it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the girls from planet mars the males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable if ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation i'd have to mace her to get rid of her she obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else she also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others br br in one show comes home from a date close to 10 pm she got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction she goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went she dithers on about how boring the guy was her date somehow got a few words in complained about how the man didn't stop talking choke hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was br br one other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality even dresses like her kid this obviously 40 something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow br br i thought that this show should have been followed by just shoot me because that's exactly how i felt,0
1967,ok this is one strange film fans of ed wood jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director george barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device there is more humor than horror here but i found it an uneven blend you will be laughing and crying and probably wondering why you got your hands on this barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972 and was completed in 1977 at a cost of 10 000 that's 59 months and 9 900 too much if you like your cheese on the campy side with vintage '70s gore you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack,0
1968,bardem is great actresses are great but amenabar did not have to do it like this it is ok that he defends his position on the euthanasia an extremely delicate issue but doing it like this makes him lose his point the movie is a false offensive to the intelligence full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring some scenes are advertising material more than a movie women are incredibly attracted to this mind sick man who wants to make someone to kill him not understanding the implications of that he seems not to care about no one and thank them for their caring love and attention i think that amenabar might have make people think about this issue in a different way but the way he chose to do it i believe is not correct he could have make his point more powerful exposing the other side of the coin without mocking it,0
1969,i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from grove ill with two of his high school buds he seemed like a normal enough guy though he had a lot of artistic pretensions within a few years he jumped into post punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere although it got him a lot of action including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco then n y c br br i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned courtney love's name seemed to be the clincher i have no idea how the movie came about especially with this cast but i doubt that gus van sant was involved anyway the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer or artist or something but doesn't have anything to say like kerouac without the benzedrine,0
1970,this movie has got to be one of the all time lows of michael j fox's generally respectable career i should have known how awful this movie was when i rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter never a good sign fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids his character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being mikey his big break comes when he meets angie vega a talented child vega is abrasive and not at all likeable in fact the only likeable character in the whole movie is cyndi lauper as a brooklyn accented receptionist for the agency one of those movies that makes me want to stick a post it note to the box warning others not to waste their time,0
1971,this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute the acting is terrible the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss yuck what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best film' the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker and if the paper thin plot line could really keep going on as is was i was not disappointed by this latter notion there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested also i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of resident evil 2 in the movie was that supposed to be filler 'cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie,0
1972,amateur camera work aside i thought this movie was very different and unlike all the blogs and posts i have read i got something totally different out of the ending than others the premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church how they must adhere to all the rigid rules and regulations but the daughter seems to have problems staying on track what with nasty thoughts of others and her use of bad language yet she prays a lot as does her family then one day they are headed to a church picnic and are in an accident from there the parents and her brother change what with being knocked out and saved by jesus warning major spoiler alert or so we are led to believe i think if you watch this movie from the point of view of the daughter only then really pay attention to the end you will see that what we the audience thinks is an actual occurrence with the parents and son is in fact all a dream and from the daughter's pov this would explain a lot of the actions portrayed by the parents and the son which were totally opposite of how they lived before especially the sex and also would also explain why peggy got away with murder etc look at how perfect that pie is but go back and look at the cake betty makes that is unless caroline removed all evidence that the pie was laced and also the fact that the scene where she sees her dead parents laying there in each others arms and her brother all whom of which seemed to die very peacefully even if being poisoned fits with a dream sequence,1
1973,these days asian horror films are among the best in the world noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society this is not one of those films instead the record is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like i know what you did last summer and scream the plot is familiar 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime but cover it up swearing to secrecy one year later they're being stalked by a knife wielding maniac with the unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going the direction of the movie is unsubtle more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films like the ring the last third of the movie isn't too bad though delivering some decent suspense scenes though there is probably one twist too many in the end 4 10,0
1974,there is nothing at all redeeming about this film it is very bad and not in such a way that it is even remotely funny horrible plot acting and writing and incredibly cheap production values to boot this film makes the look like a work of art,0
1975,an eko centric episode the explores the aftermath of the tragic events that rocked the castaways in the previous one as the main characters john locke sawyer kate and hurley come to terms with the incident in the hatch locke and eko set out to find out where henry took off to as it turns out eko is on a mission of his own trying to figure out the symbol which locke had drawn on his sketch we see flashes of life in sydney as a priest who comes in contact with his brother through a stranger we also witness the tragedy that struck the hatch boil down to a room temperature as michael continues to remain a mystery br br an excellent lost episode with many interesting turns,1

1977,kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school it really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in la in 1980 as the bands play prints the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone but also it turns the camera's pov into that of tourist passing through this alien world the band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore then again it's not as easy to come by 16 month former church closets like chavez of black flag does how many unheard of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal these guys just didn't care and who can't love the commentary of the little french dude who used to be the singer for catholic discipline of which was a member his gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film i have excellent news for the world there's no such thing as new wave whew what a relief,1

1980,i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era but i'd be lying through my teeth very uncomfortable position if i pretended that this big screen spin off is anything other than an abomination the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses and nothing improves from there by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book the horrible dragon of a mother in law turns up unexpectedly to stay is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black father moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self righteous ignorant rage most discerning viewers will have switched off take that as a warning unless you're keen on spin offs with terrible acting static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage,0
1981,this is a very dark movie somewhat better than the average asylum film it was a lot better than i thought it would be is a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror film br br the voice on the telephone is really creepy this voice without a face this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the film since we never see the killer face is left to the imagination of the spectator br br the action and suspense never decay and after the first half of the film it becomes vertiginous there is not much gore in this film just enough to serve the story and also the director does a good job at holding your attention br br i gave this movie a 8 10 because some clichés,1
1982,each frame in the movie is a lesson to new directors or existing directors to know how a movie should be taken hats off to he is underestimated in indian film industry the director has got all the qualities in taking this movie in the range of ray every character is portrayed effectively in the movie though it's simple story it's been taken to such extent it can be considered to one of the best in india i don't have enough adjectives to praise the movie just as the way the life goes in day today atmosphere the movie has been taken though the songs in indian movies are considered to a weak area songs in this movie has given extra energy to the potential of the movie especially background score it's amazing,1
1983,bluff i really think this movie is very good br br is basic a different kind of colombian movie is hilarious and the actors uses local expressions that are so much fund to listen br br it shows a different face o and i think that's very important because colombia is a diverse country and we need to show that to the world this is the first movie of the director martinez and i really except this movie will be the beginning of a great career as a film director br br we need to continue support colombian filming industry because this movie and others good films are the beginning of something big,1
1984,as an adult i am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when i was a teen during the time i was experiencing familial problems this particular movie managed to capture what i was seeing from a closeted world how much peer pressure is too much i actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience how far might an individual go for social acceptance who is the bad crowd teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately who is the pack leader if there must be one is it the strong the beautiful perhaps the person we just all seem to like could it be the moral character as far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined i only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me i wish i could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more,1
1985,this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer director bill uses his clowning antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks pantomime dance and various physical devices br br although it takes a big swipe at the entertainment industry and his craft it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages br br this work was televised as a pbs special bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show but out of context it did not go over well,1
1986,i can tell by the other comments that nobody could ever actually enjoy this trifling piece of crap that's the same way i felt br br the whole time i was watching it i was horrified that anyone could make a movie this stupid what is the world coming to i guess it is my fault for sitting through the entire movie ugh but it was like a bad car wreck i couldn't look away br br if you are a kid under 8 years of age you might like this movie otherwise stay away from it at all costs it's the stupidest movie i've ever seen br br everything's stupid the story script and especially the acting everything while watching the movie you'll either turn the tv off and think how can a movie be so sadly stupid or keep on watching from curiosity to see if things can get more stupid than this they can't br br these movie makers if you can call them that need to seriously go back to their day jobs not one of them has an ounce of talent and i highly doubt you can make a living churning out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to see br br just drawn out b s don't waste your time,0
1987,focus is an engaging story told in urban wwii era setting william macy portrays everyman who is taken out of his personal circumstances and challenged with decisions testing his values affecting the community laura dern macy and david paymer give good performances so also the good supporting ensemble,1
1988,i think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly the cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the girl she was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother best of all are the songs beautiful music and moving lyrics there are some great songs in this move ya'll especially and great songs both of them i highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting and superb songs cheers,1
1989,this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film a truly truly bad film,0
1990,a wide variety of snakes stage an uprising on tourists invading their island due their captain's boat damage the few remaining survivors who aren't caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission their goal to flee to available boats which can get them safely off the island br br presented straight faced with injected doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags wayne crawford's snake island features plenty of different breeds of the predators in striking position ready to attack their prey star william katt as an author researching snakes for a forthcoming novel has fun in his role along with writer director co star wayne crawford as the tourist boat captain as put upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis kate connor is crawford's attractive love interest a lawyer on vacation the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew mostly fodder for the snakes br br as in many other movies of this type director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones and the violence is really tame crawford even incorporates the point of view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victim with the actor looking directly into the camera never to be taken seriously the tongue in cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on it's own br br the effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen one or two tops or are so limply presented they leave little impression that's a no no for a genre such as this fans of katt will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that establishes the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area aren't very effective which remove the realism crawford might've attempted to establish there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than snake island surprising moments of nudity relegated to a scene where the tourists and crew unwind after a long day with the bubbly not knowing what danger lie ahead,0
1991,this film is on my top 20 comedies list this is a truly unique film to the reviewer who said i must be really missing something you are correct you are missing something if you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that's one thing but don't give it a bad review because you think it's looney but isn't intended to be loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being i laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than i do at most other funny films br br michael almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an independent spirit award for best first feature crispin glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now harry dean stanton puts in an excellent comic performance william burroughs is incredible in a small role dylan mcdermott was ideally cast and lois chiles is completely excellent br br all of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of crispin's finest performances up there with his performances in river's edge and willard if you are a crispin glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately br br but just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something this is a great film but it is very unusual and i recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing,1
1992,having seen this without knowing all the hoopla surrounding the lead character indeed without even knowing that it was based on real life events i must say i am impressed murder in greenwich is an above average production for a made for tv movie the acting is uniformly great christopher meloni in particular putting in a stand out performance and the teen actors excel in what are difficult roles the idea of the dead girl narrating the movie is a stroke of genius which elevates the movie from merely good to excellent the script is exemplary for what is essentially movie of the week fodder and the cinematography is beautiful,1
1993,i really love action adventure films and this is one of the best of course we love the stars of this genre bruce willis sly stallone clint eastwood kurt russell arnold schwarzenegger and the rest but its the story that really counts the best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little over the top as in the comic book style of action the more twists and turns the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film the more we action adventure fans enjoy them in the line of fire has all the elements required for a rip roaring action thriller it has clint eastwood as a near retirement secret service agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him it has one of the most evil despicable maniacal villains in john malkovich the type in which you can't wait to see him get his due it has rene russo as the 'love interest ' it has twists and turns an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor it is extremely well paced by director wolfgang petersen and even has a score by the great ennio morricone this one is a real roller coaster ride of a thriller don't miss it,1
1994,over the many years there are some films that just slip by hardly anyone views br br choose conner is one of those films br br this small gem played at some festivals had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in west hollywood making all of about br br it is now on dvd i do hope many more will now see this br br it is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician who influences a very bright 15 year old lad this politico also has a handsome nephew about 17 years old who befriends the 15 year old lad br br the above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs so is the film that is what i appreciated we do not get all the facts much is left to our own thinking you will hear dialog that makes this logical br br steven weber wings is our politician his role is slightly vague this is another point for the audience to ponder br br alex d linz is our 15 year old he was about 17 when they made this movie but easily can pass for younger he has been in films tv since he was a young child he is a very good actor is quite convincing br br escher holloway is the older teen this role is his first major part he too is excellent br br now i am saving the best for last the writer director br br luke is not yet 23 years old for a first effort a big thumbs up i do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career br br ratings out of 4 86 points out of 100 imdb 8 out of 10,1
1995,it is fantastic a sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceit br br the story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed it is really a perfect mixture it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality the film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece and resolves the story for the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end i also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some hitchcock work i've also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that in this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again in a different location every actor in the story has his own secret and we come to realize it in a way that contributes to assembling the puzzle i loved especially the dark humor scenes which made laugh the whole theater this movie is a must see for everyone,1
1996,1999 adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film the 1999 film is reviled by many austen purists but i admire the job did in making mansfield park her own it may not be strictly jane austen's mansfield park but at least it was well written beautifully shot and well acted by a superior cast i don't see how austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from itv and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatre pbs the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot the production values are lackluster and the cast apart from redgrave and blake are largely guilty of bad acting i can't think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price her look was all wrong bleached hair and dark brows and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material sir thomas looked constipated the whole time michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the '99 version i just kinda shake my head br br i haven't seen the 1983 version so i can't comment on it but i'd advise anyone who's curious to give the '99 version a chance read the novel before or after and make up your own mind,0
1997,perhaps many viewers who got frustrated by this film live their lives without ever thinking deeply about life itself what i want to point out here is that distant is not only an art house film but one of the best art house films from all the art house films i have seen distant is the one that really stands out as a glittering piece of gold it is even fair to say that this film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion surpass tarkovsky's nostalgia one commentator got it right that sex a jaded common feature among foreign films is surprisingly lacking in distant and in a good way what is most remarkable about distant is that it captures the details of life we usually ignore and the rich essence of our existence that often gets buried under the din and visual extravaganza of our commercialized world fortunately distant doesn't have that much to spare the audiences and what we see on the screen is a bare portrait of human beings,1
1998,all things old are new again erika e is on celebrity fitness vh1 florida state rep mark foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit emails to a 16 yr old male page as i edit this mr foley is resigning from his representative seat mr foley you see does his turn at acting as the father of the recovered girl seen during the opening sequence my place in movie history will forever be solidified with my appearance in the graveyard scene i should have looked at this as a omen i hate to say it but be warned if you place this in your dvd be prepare to put your toe on the trigger of the shotgun you'll soon have between your teeth your level of depression has reached its zenith i have seen better writing put to screen on an etch a sketch shot in 1999 00 under the working title the librarians in and around palm beach co why the librarian's you ask well you would need to be wrapped as tight as binding to be able to read anything into this frat party of over the hill stunt men plying their trade onto celluloid for one last time oh well enough with the accolades burt reynolds as a irish mobster in miami no less possibly the worst forced accent impression since linda lovelace in deep throat william forsythe as a hip slick and cool tough guy doubtful possibly 10 years ago i'd say it's curtain time for mike you now have the forsythe to pass up this sub par movie more like a film school project for anything on tape disc or paper your local retailer has to offer,0
1999,team spirit is maybe made by the best intentions but it misses the warmth of all stars 1997 by jean van de velde most scenes are just not that funny and not that well done the actors repeat the same lines as in all stars but without much feeling,0
2000,this movie starts out with this creepy song that gave me some chills like the song used in nightmare on it immediately sets the mood the sequence that follows also shows what to expect we are made aware that a ghost is present the mystery concerning this ghost is what keeps this movie together but the structure of the plot is so complex that it is difficult to make sense of it the ideas behind the plot are quite interesting only the way it is told to us is far too abstract i understand that the director believed that he had to maintain the mystery as long as possible the problem is that when certain matters get revealed you never get a satisfying explanation the motives of the important characters are left out and some questions raised in the movie don't get answered at all since we don't learn enough about the characters it becomes hard to care for them and as a consequence you will loose interest only some scares and a twist save this movie from becoming a total failure the twist is interesting but no real shocker the experienced viewer will see it coming some reviewers complain that this movie is too much like ringu and is not original at all well it is true that some of the effects and scares are borrowed from that movie but there is a main difference the suspense in ringu mainly was based on this one twist where the viewer finds out how the characters get killed in the ringu like twist is used as a creepy effect to accompany another crazy twist heavily depends on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough scares to hold your interest simply put this isn't a scary movie,0
2001,two things are changed from then first of all i am not a kid anymore and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van damme there is no plot in this movie the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch i love action movies but this is not an action movie this isn't a movie this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie he has a serious intelligence problem then i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future good luck for him,0
2002,okul is the first of its kind in turkish cinema and it's way better than i expected those people who say it's neither scary nor funny have a point it's not all that great indeed but it must be kept in mind that everyone involved with the movie is rather amateur so it's basically a maiden voyage and comparing this one to other films such as the 1st class garbage propaganda this movie is pretty damn good br br one thing that must be said it deals with the highschool students' life in turkey very realistically that's exactly how it goes the scenes that are meant to scare are somewhat cheap and hollywoodish most of them even if not all but that religion lesson scene made me laugh in tears and performs the best acting of this flick as a religion teacher br br it's not a waste of your time go and watch it you'll find it rather amusing especially if you know turkey enough to relate to turkish school lives,1
2003,happy 25th birthday to valley girl great soundtrack plausible story wonderful performances captures the spirit of the 80's the slang of the and the outcasts a wonderful rendition of high school life and gritty downtown from a suburban perspective br br the soundtrack contains songs by modern english josie cotton sparks josie cotton the the psychedelic furs men at work the flirts and br br this movie truly is romeo and juliet minus the double suicide set in 1980's los angeles julie's dad played by frederic forrest sonny bono anyone is hysterical as a hippie idealistic dad who wonders how he sprung such a materialistic offspring yet he doesn't judge ya dig,1
2004,this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film cheap dialogue no character development no tension not enough story to pull you in no action apart from some really cheap scenes it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other hey this looks rather cool why not put this in there after which the director probably said yeah yeah this is genius and got back to snorting coke or something when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is but in the end it is all for nothing cause this movie sucks 2 10,0
2005,it seems like if you are going to post here it going to be a 10 star rating nobody ever seems to dislike anything well i am honest some don't like that but here we go rachel ray show is just plain awful this show reminds me of the snl character linda whatever if she had a cooking whatever show i must say i liked rachel on the food network on 35 40 a day but i am sorry she does not have enough life experience to make her interesting day in and day out give me ham on the street anthony interesting folks but most of all i find her annoying she actually told a member of the studio audience to shut up yes in a kidding way but shut up is shut up and who cares about her pet stories sorry rachel you been cancelled,0
2006,turning somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster but it wasn't the story moves at a rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky weimar berlin fun,1
2007,i have seen this movie since i was a little girl and being from new york and remembering how people lived back then brought back a lot of good memories this movie is not just about wanting a fairy tale ending but understanding the struggles of becoming a better person woman and provider claudine attempted to be it was about the welfare system putting women in a binding situation it was about the injustice of a system that invaded and put demands on a family to stay afloat diane carroll was nominated for an oscar for this role and it was well deserved if you want to experience a strong family with conflicting but wonderful bonding moments enjoy claudine your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration,1
2008,the film makers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics palestinians that have the appearance of peace loving solution seeking good will palestinians particularly older women and families with children who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence and israelis that don't believe in the security fence sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians and consider it unnecessarily divisive and or a waste of money oh yes they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring and ask him very leading questions that are really statements e g the wall is bad for the environment it is destroying everything br br i have no problem with any well most of this being presented in the movie however much i may disagree with the people they interview their opinions are valid enough for a documentary however there are at least two sides to the issue of israel's security fence and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis and many others support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence this documentary does not present the opinion of even one such person they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that all israelis support the fence and are thus insane and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such crazy israeli oh and to top all this off they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children truly exceptions to the rule i've been there that are laughing at about their arab neighbors from across the fence br br a documentary is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts opinions and perspectives unfortunately this is not a documentary this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed emotionally and politically charged issue it is no more of a documentary than say fahrenheit 9 11,0
2009,i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life this movie was terrible i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars the acting is absolutely terrible this movie is a travesty based on the classic the most dangerous game if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli at least j lo provides some better scenery ben should pacify the ladies viewing it i'm not upset about the 7 i paid to see the move i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back br br can you give me my time back samuel l jackson changing lanes,0
2010,i've heard a lot of different opinions about this film and then to find out that paris hilton was in it as well didn't give me the best impression of the film then to be dragged to the cinema by a group of my friends and sit there expecting a pile of pants i was shocked to find that i was scared stiff all the way through the film it was predictable yes but the build up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the film made it really scary for me i was watching through my fingers the whole way through so i say go watch it and decide for yourself and if the fact that its a scary film doesn't convince you to go watch it then it also has chad michael murray in it which can't be bad to watch for a couple of hours eh,1
2011,i first saw this film in 1959 at the hoyts double bay cinema in sydney when fifteen years old i loved it then and still do the ensemble cast is great in those days the actors acted naturally and you felt for them in the respective roles a glossy film of the period the relationships therein still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are on the same level women would not or should not allow the type of treatment displayed in the past the soundtrack music is wonderful and it is a delight that film score monthly released the cd in january 2005 pity scenes were cut prior to release even at two hours you want more i have registered with amazon for the dvd they do now have a special page to view this film in cinemascope after forty six years of pan and scan will be great twentieth century fox please look further into your of fifties cinemascope productions for dvd there is a large market out there i await arrival from us of march 2004 vanity fair special article on the film which is said to be fifteen pages with many photos on set cheers,1
2012,i expected a good movie what i got was an even better movie the chemistry between james and smith is just incredible glad to see him in a major motion picture for once br br the movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly will smith is fantastic with his never ending charm kevin james is hilarious and eva mendes well let's just say she plays that bitch sweet annoying role to the best of her ability br br what i loved about the movie was the fact that will smith didn't even have to try to be lovable he just was the date doctor had all the right moves said everything in the most perfect of ways and never ever went over the top br br the funny parts are hilarious and the cute romantic parts are unforgettable br br i totally recommend this movie and no it is not a chick flick,1
2013,a good script or director couldn't fix br br the original adventure' was a story of human courage triumphing against terrific odds and personal tragedy the survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who would take anything god threw at him br br the follow up tries to recreate the mix but fails through a formulaic script and pedestrian direction irwin allen may have been a great producer of disaster flicks and done a fine job directing the action scenes in but he just can't bring any human depth to his characters if the characters aren't credible any danger they face also falls flat br br the script also tries to copy the original too obviously so we have peter boyle doing the ernest borgnine thing by being tough and obnoxious but he has a tender heart karl malden is the red buttons influence and is terminally ill for good measure slim pickens does the comic relief for shelley winters and so on br br to make the story more contemporary we have a rogue arms dealer ready to flog weapons grade plutonium to the highest bidder a really nasty piece of work who ruthlessly abandons wounded men the actors playing his henchmen were presumably paid as extras because they don't seem to have any lines and has a woman shot in the back what a cad thank goodness the french rescue services made the hole in the hull twice as large as in 1972 and on the other side of the propeller shaft so he could he get his goods out and while we're on the subject how did they get the crates to the oh forget it br br i actually paid good money to see this when it was released given the film's current reputation this may seem odd but it actually got quite mixed reviews at the time some said it was junk some said it was as exciting as the original never mind nobody can be right all the time,0
2014,this was the most thought provoking capital punishment movie ever it refused to seem one sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get this movie had one of the most 'human' and i use this term in a good way compassionate religious character ever this movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book which is rare for me sister helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious which is also rare and it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out and we have the director to thank for that this is not a film for entertainment but it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart i can't think of another film like it,1
2015,i have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of coppola's masterpiece i was lucky enough to meet martin sheen outside the santa monica civic auditorium one night in 1981 as he waited for charlie and emilio to leave a concert he was very humble about the praise i shared with him for this work of art especially his portrayal of the young captain this is without a doubt a must see a complete 10 and an important part of american film history charlie don't surf robert duvall's famous line the other one does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his character will long be remembered as a classic american war hawk in the john wayne tradition it is a surprise to see how young laurence fishburne looks,1
2016,it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception br br i am no lover of yanks but their amazingly simplistic view of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white as well as make events even fictional ones in novels fit an agenda that bears little or no relationship to complexity of any kind is irritating in the extreme br br wilbur smith is verbose but weaves intricate tales that deserve more than has been delivered by this awful mishmash of a movie br br sad really for those who will never read smith they will be left with a less than decent portrayal of his egyptian series which has to be said is gigantic in its exposition br br the indiana jones movies were snappy to attempt to replicate that by manipulating smith's novels into this production misses out by a country mile br br pathetic except for the photography and art malik,0
2017,one of the most unfairly maligned programmes of all time was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70's and '80's br br it started life as 'happy ever but when eric merriman decided he didn't want to write any more it changed into this hence the dropping of 'aunt and the fletcher's becoming the br br yes it was cosy domestic middle class stuff the plots ran the gamut of clichés from the boss coming to dinner the vicar organising a jumble sale and unwanted relatives coming to stay for the weekend it was certainly not lazy comedy' as for it being 'not it was not meant to be it was funny and well performed and that was enough br br i too loved the boom of the '80's 'black adder' 'the young ones' etc but also enjoyed conventional stuff such as this if nothing else it provided alternative comedy with something to be an alternative to i found it sad though when the likes of ben elton took against both this and benny hill well family oriented comedy has all but vanished from our screens but where has it left us take a look at the latest t v schedules all soaps and reality dross the few comedies left are aimed at teenagers meaning they are jam packed with swearing bodily function jokes and explicit sexual references and they are not remotely funny either br br the comedy' boom was good in many ways but had a dark side it made conventional sitcoms appear old fashioned drove away talented writers and performers such as spike milligan and ultimately led to such unspeakable drivel as 'little britain' and heaven help us if it ain't broke don't fix it,1
2018,don't bother to check for logic there is none but on the other hand there are many really great movies that totally lack logic so why bother br br i both like and dislike this film i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great you get to see a lot of i also like the f 16 which is a very cool plane br br but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity as it is hard to make a really good fighter film but i also think there should be some sense of reason br br and i have a question do they fly from california to the middle east in f 16s without air refueling i'd like to see that happening,0
2019,um a serious film about troubled teens in singapore a country i have not much knowledge on but have the previous wrong impression that all the kids there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and government well i guess i am wrong just like other cities countries they also have their troubled teens who also lead the not so surprising rebellious way of life of drugs fights bad language and many other obvious signs of being a bad boy the surprising part of this film isn't really about how these kids running around causing themselves and others trouble but rather the subtle gayness hidden behind their so call loyalty between them the bond between these brothers may very well originated from an unconscious gay tendency inside these boys though it isn't uncommon for guys to have very close friendship with each other but watch this film closely it should be entering all sorts of gay film festivals and i would not be surprised that it may win itself a lot more awards toward this direction,1
2020,this movie has everything going for it fully developed characters a realistic portrayal of working washington bathed in warmth and humor that is uniquely albert brooks the dumbing down of network news is even more of an issue now than it was in 1987 remember this was pre cable so satisfying to care about complex people attempting to achieve complex goals and it all moves along with lightning speed such a true to life depiction of friendships that teeter toward romance see if you can spot john cusack as the angry messenger and do you recognize peter from real life broadcast news finally if you're from dc see if you agree with holly hunter's directions to cab drivers,1
2021,ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on like a celebrity awards presentation each major actor actress is introduced in short 60 second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign the first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing speaking of the story there is one kinda but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos only matt damon seemed to actually act during this film the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat pack wanna be session as for the heist the action the drama it was put into the last 8 10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic horrible horrible horrible,0
2022,i have seen many japanese and i have to say that some of them are really interesting but they are all pretty much the same this one is no exception the ghost is a black haired girl that scares it's victims by doing nothing else than walk and look dead the difference is just the motive for the haunting the rest is the same as every time black haired girl strange things happening with some media photos creepy acting while watching this flick i constantly found myself asking why i was wasting my time watching stuff that someone else has done so much better before some scenes where quite nice though i'll give it 3 out of 10,0
2023,a kinda remake of planes trains and automobiles in a lot of ways i think i think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that both john candy and chris farley left us when they still had a lot of stuff to do god bless them both i think the plots of 2 movies are really similar road trips of two different poles of characters and a lot of unlucky consequences because of the this movie can not be planes trains and automobiles but its a really entertaining movie especially with the great performance of chris farley the missing part in this movie is the touchy stuff if we compare it with candy martin classic but i think its better this way,1
2024,the second live action outing for asterix is far better than the glued together elements of ten different stories that was called the first film instead staying fairly close to the original comic br br in a nutshell queen cleopatra has made a bet with to build a palace in egypt to show that the egyptians are a great people royal architect seeks the help of asterix and druid to complete his task there are several laugh out loud moments some jokes that only the french might get jibes at the 35 hour week while others that are more universal the big budget special effects are spectacular but overshadowed by the jokes from the original comic br br depardieu and clavier still work brilliantly as a pair while monica bellucci makes perfect casting as cleopatra also for fans of the comics the hilarious pirates get a look making up for their absence in film 1,1
2025,i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest first of all one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies it is a thriller get it right it has no monsters or anything supernatural it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film one of these girls turns out to be a local detective's daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdy carleton played adequately by writer producer twisted sister frontman dee snider the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film he fails miserably and unintentionally makes light of them the directing by john whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women which i will let the title speak for itself was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot unless the screenplay is at fault which is quite possible this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings if you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and is on cable you might as well watch 3 out of 10,0
2026,i'm a fan of judy garland vincente minnelli and gene kelly but this movie just left me cold i was expecting another american in paris from minnelli so perhaps i was expecting too much br br the movie was short on songs and short of impressive dance numbers i was impressed by the very expressionistic kelly dance as on the ship i was also impressed by the nicholas brothers in be a clown too bad the song was so annoying i also enjoyed judy attacking kelly with a check lorna autobiography for some interesting information on that scene br br actually the movie has what must be some of cole porter's most annoying songs especially nina also judy and gene yell constantly like screechy children br br the plot is thin which is par for the course for musicals but it is not saved by impressive dance numbers or by memorable songs i suspect the best parts of this movie were left on the cutting room floor please some movie find those bits of film and show us what the movie could have been,0
2027,after watching the series premiere of talk show with spike i took a moment to really think wow there are actually good shows on after 12 besides snl and i was also sad to see that it was only 30 minutes long his great writing skills helped this show overcome a series lack of money and helping hands electronic lincoln was hilarious and i really think this will be a good dark horse talk show br br i was very happy with the way he handled it and gave andy some good lines to work with as you would have suspected it was a little shaky but for that kind of time slot it was very good br br overall if you are not someone on weed or even if you are and you don't have something more important to do than watch this great piece and have a fun time doing it,1
2028,the atmosphere in this show is great there's plenty of excellent buildup but thats where this show fails there's way to much build up for nothing you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then nothing over and over again nothing you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none they show up at these peoples doors talk about their deep and emotional pasts set up lame equipment and find nothing there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal i laugh every time they need to exercise a horrible spirit that we as an audience have seen nothing of they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing nothing,0
2029,this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where a monk with his three students seek out to find a long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha br br though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and fun filled humorous scene br br this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures one of his student the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of a dragon locked up in that particular dungeon br br the monk awoke in a small village where he found mei yan the so called ugly serpent daughter who fell in love over him at first sight though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him however a quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse br br the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for a funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean br br towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love the monk went to show the heavenly gates the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers br br a wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket there would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film,1
2030,i really wanted this to be good as i am from liverpool where it is set but it truly awful the acting from everyone involved is cringeworthy the script is terrible absolutly terrible terrible,0
2031,i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made a bulgarian italian co production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between is hardly credible the english vocabulary is basically limited to fuck you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine apart from this racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight and if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white in order to create some tension we see the serial killer and hear him hum schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face br br i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin but the actors are not seen in those shot it's probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there,0
2032,i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a pic here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film br br all mexican women are super hot remember that little desert town in unearthed yeah well this must be it's mexican sister city don't even bother with the hookers just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well br br half of mexico is controlled by insane satan worshiping palo cultists the other half as everyone here in the u s knows is run by drug dealers fortunately this doesn't much interfere with the sex trade and our ultra low wage factories down there br br mexican cops are useless don't go to them go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend she'll be way more help than the cops br br when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible really you'll just mess up the mojo,0
2033,i had stifled high hopes for this david lynch whom i really like film but the very poor acting by everybody but naomi watts was the first clue that this was a wasted effort some twin peaks characters are recycled into this film but it wasn't eerie it wasn't interesting except for the topless watts scenes and the quirks were poorly executed br br i will probably give lynch one more chance but the hype around this film just doesn't pan out especially for those of us fans who saw eraserhead when it first came out,0
2034,my wife and i loved this film smart dialogue great characters clever plot construction the pacing in this film is non stop couldn't even get to the kitchen for some munchies we have never seen corey feldman this funny taylor nichols plays a good fed my wife loves him on that married man hbo show the ensemble cast were all strong the twist at the end had us cheering that is why we give this film a standing o,1
2035,this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows a certain dixie boy johnson whether this person ever really existed i don't know but considering the cast lists a certain lee white and roscoe karns playing said character as well i assume the man did exist and that this is a white washed pardon the pun version of his career the plot such as it is follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth his abandonment of the child to friends and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation another forgotten man benny fields plays dixie boy the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom worth a look,0
2036,recently i saw this movie again after 25 years in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline character and michael character the rented version did not have this scene in it did i imagine this br br or is this part of the clean up of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not appropriate br br i love this movie it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we've been friends for 25 years and saw it together her husband thought it was us as well br br thank you joan,1
2037,visconti's masterpiece i admit that i am unfamiliar with much of his work but i cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film last night i watched death in venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that i saw this was a pastiche composed of many elements the extraordinary shots directed by primarily his love of long languorous shots of people dining swimming walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of visconti's shot selection the acting by the principles without over riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone br br it is true young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film a film that could not be made in 2006 a film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the sixties and early seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money men took secondary roles as many of the recent imdb commentator's have written this film in their judgment is long boring too little action and pretentious i suppose by the standards of hollywood pap these comments contain merit unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years br br please if you have not seen death in venice rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time you will be rewarded,1
2038,due to a very misleading advertising campaign i saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10 the trailers on tv portrayed the film as a comedy and i bugged my parents until they took me after seeing the movie i was blown away i had no idea what to think totally different than anything i had seen before leaving far to many questions for such a young mind needless to say i loved it this morning was the first time i'd watched in in probably 2 3 years and i still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade kevin spacey and jeff bridges are both in top form as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery the supporting cast are near perfect as well each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way the open ending was handled very well giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end how this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's oscars is beyond me if you haven't seen this film run to wal mart right now the dvd is usually in the bargain bin pick it up br br 9 5 10,1
2039,spoilers below br br a dog's life' was most noteworthy for its excellent comic timing in charlie chaplin's other movie from 1918 shoulder the silent film genius focuses on an entirely different brand of humor his war comedy specializes in surreal exaggerated set pieces in which chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition when the soldier's bunker gets flooded the water level reaches just the right height so that chaplin can execute his gags most successfully in a later scene the soldier dresses up as a tree a disguise that belies chaplin's much increased ingenuity and goofiness naturally when the enemy discovers his ruse the soldier darts straight for the forest the ensuing chase is a visual marvel chaplin not only hides the soldier from the germans but he uses the forest to mask the soldier from the audience as well such that the camouflaged soldier stands in the middle of the frame yet somehow remains invisible all the while we thought our little hero was pulling a fast one on the german army to our delight the joke is on us too br br rating 8,1
2040,this movie is ageless and would probably appeal to children today even if there isn't a jedi in the entire thing of course elizabeth taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is great too even mickey rooney is good so are anne revere and angela lansbury the world was a different place when this movie was released and it certainly is a great place to visit,1
2041,when the china syndrome was released plenty of right wing critics and pro nuke supporters blasted this film particularly since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their overt distrust of nuclear power but it only took two weeks and a near catastrophic accident at three mile island to shut those critics up br br fonda and douglas are the l a news crew that witness a potentially nasty accident at the nuclear power plant douglas films the event through the plant's soundproof glass but the tv station will not air the footage fearing a massive lawsuit it is thus up to fonda and douglas to get at the truth despite a massive attempt by the plant's owners to cover up the accident br br but a conscientious shift supervisor jack lemmon has uncovered certain defects in the plant's pump support structure he believes that these defects were the cause of the accident and that though it would be extremely costly and lengthy if repairs aren't made the next accident could be apocalyptic but he can't get anyone who works with him to believe his story the result is a nightmarish climax that pulls various political technological and human interest stories together in one disturbing package br br while obviously quite politically liberal in nature the china syndrome well directed and co written by james bridges the paper chase is also fundamentally a message movie about the inherent dangers of putting technology and nuclear power together fundamentally nuclear power can never be made safe because people can never be perfect that is what the film is saying and in a highly entertaining and suspenseful way it says it brilliantly,1
2042,i love this movie and i recommend it to anybody damian and jennifer tilly played their roles perfectly just the characters alone pull you in to the movie the directing was also magnificent the most creative shots i've ever seen i was stuck to the screen throughout the whole movie not one scene was slow the movie also has a lot of action packed scenes cars blowing up etc the movie is just an all around masterpiece if you like real entertaining movies then watch this because you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time i put this movie on my top ten all time list because there is never a dull moment in the movie and that is my type of movie 2 thumbs up all the way up,1
2043,another sequel why on earth do they keep making these this has got to be the weakest ever yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels scarecrow gone wild which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series brings back the evil straw man who again butchers up some college kids that's basically it the acting sucks as usual the death scenes are beyond pathetic and don't be fooled by the title this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think a couple nice topless girls but nothing too pants tightening let me just conclude my continuous insult or review on this movie by saying if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves i'm going to be in absolute awe,0
2044,the emergence of quentin tarantino and his dubious influence on the likes of guy ritchie may have triggered the wave of appalling british gangster flicks we've been bequeathed over the past few years but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this i only wish he'd taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs it's not only stifling his talent but possibly the promise of future originality from british films br br not one of this film's characters are likeable or even remotely realistic and the dialogue consists of the usual empty threats and colourful language caine doesn't give the material any more effort than it deserves either if this was meant to be in the style of a tragic fall from grace a la king lear it would've helped immensely had i cared about the ultimate fate of the principals instead of just wishing that they'd get mired in the quicksand of life and dragged under almost immediately br br,0
2045,br br i was fascinated to read the range of opinions on circus' from awesome breathtaking and most things between right down to golden turkey candidate' i find myself in the latter camp br br the producers obviously thought that if they mixed plenty of over the top violence with barrages of four letter expletives they'd have another lock stock and two smoking barrels' on their hands a pity that they forgot to include wit style charm and flair and it was certainly a mistake to feature a visit to welles' classic the lady from shanghai' thus serving to remind us how much better cinema can be br br john hannah gets his shirt off at every opportunity a huge american drives around in a mini minor as circus' pathetically strains for cult status and even the beautiful amanda donohoe can't add any class to these proceedings br br if you want to see a good brit film try the sublime wonderland',0
2046,one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint br br this movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen there are no bad guys or good guys makes sure of that the characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been through br br use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of fast food movies and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable you love the feeling it gives you br br i have heard it said too often that there are no new stories to tell thank you for proving that false br br run don't walk to see this movie,1
2047,magnificent original beautiful movie the acting is great the settings en decors are superb paris at its best but then the real paris not the famous settings and the music will do also a brilliant very detailed which i just very much love br br the best french movie i've seen and french cinema is very good,1
2048,a young girl becomes a war time marine's pen pal and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more available comic complications ensue all ultimately works out well naturally but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery errol flynn's dead on impression of humphrey bogart from casablanca is a highlight as are various send ups of his own swashbuckling image the jumping scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot it is tucker though who the movie under his arm lowers his head and barrels over the goal line he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in f troop and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued and little patti brady charms as tucker's actual pen pal friend a fine lightweight coming home comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining,1
2049,i've recently seen an not because it was a hong kong film but because i was looking for a change from the films being produced here in the us in my humble opinion i believe the film could easily compete against the action thrillers being produced here except for the traditional of hong kong film the one that still bothers me was the chief inspector character i still don't understand why there has to be a complete idiot comic relief type character even in the serious films that come out of hong kong but i can live with it when the movie is this good the characters are believable even if the situations they are in are not the story is fast paced and really sucks you in to it the real scenes for me were the two bus rides that the thief character takes overall a really solid film,1
2050,i avoided this film as a boy because i thought it would be fights or shooting cops robbers cowboys or indians it was definitely not a cool film to like so i didn't see until i was in my twenties and found it one of the most beautiful captivating films i have seen all the actors deliver the characterisations perfectly and each emotion is drawn from the viewer scene by scene the filming and direction are deceptively simple but feel so natural and drew me completely into the story my two favourite scenes are birthday party and the scene on the station platform near the end directed and edited to perfection the quality and phrasing of jenny voice when she calls my daddy ' wrenches emotion from the viewer tears are welling in my eyes as i think of it br br this adaptation isn't just a movie it is a piece of precious art as well as being the perfect example of what all film makers should be striving to of an emotional experience,1
2051,when i went to see bon voyage i expected a good skillful on the order of grand hotel 1932 and les enfants de paradis 1944 it was better than that with few exceptions none of the characters were totally good or totally evil just as in real life the acting was wonderful especially those who played raoul and camille the photography was amazing as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in around bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the look of june 1940 costumes and make up were accurate there is so much in this movie that it's worth a second viewing it's exciting funny and ultimately touching n b be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection it's in wide screen and in the theater where i saw it the in the first 30 minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors' faces slightly fuzzy this was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film,1
2052,i was at the world premier of this movie and have even met todd a couples times around town once at olive garden todd isn't a bad guy he is just a small time film maker with little to no budget and big dreams br br as for the movie it is good if you like zombie films with very little plot and lots of blood and guts you get to see some kansas city locations and lots of raw meat what could be better look for the same 2 dozen people playing different zombies with just a change of clothes or hats you can have a good drinking game with this movie take a shot whenever you see the same zombie in a different shirt,1
2053,is not a bad movie but the acting and the screenplay can be better i like this movie because i have a life that is in good part like the one in the movie is hard for a lost generation to get a life in romania and 90 percent of us choose something else and that something else includes dealing with people with bad habits if you understand me but that comes with the territory this movie represent me and i like it i have a rage in me that i barley talk with people i live in a messed up society and i can't fit in and i don't want to and that's the story of movie also if you r like me you can understand the true movie if not you will find it easy and cheap,1
2054,barney is just awful as many of the other reviews on this show say i'm not one to disagree with them i won't because i hate this show just as much as they do they use kids that look like they're in sixth grade cheesy plots horrid dialog and really crappy special effects not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself he makes every other kid show look like award winners sesame street has won awards that i know about br br please just watch sesame street thomas the tank engine or even the teletubbies avoid both this and its movie which i also reviewed they are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate to anyone even little babies,0
2055,the 1935 version of enchanted april manages to be simultaneously tedious br br and perfunctory it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later rather than develop the screenplay flips a switch and the br br characters are different br br the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and or hostilities br br jessie ralph has the most fun moving instead of entirely chewing up the br br scenery and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her br br husband's shadow and away from his hideous droning ann harding is br br unremarkable here with the production code being enforced she had an br br appropriate line in an earlier pre code movie when ladies meet you're br br not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you but in enchanted april can only look hurt rush out and proclaim to her errant husband,0
2056,so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories although they did have some interesting results in this case they're baby sitting a bad boy and lou tries to read him jack and the but falls asleep and dreams that he's jack and bud's the butcher and they climb the to rescue the prince and princess from the giant buddy baer br br i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an omelet and well i'll let you see what happens as this was an abbott and costello movie they did have a few unnecessary songs but other than that it was pretty funny for other interpretations of the classic story bewitched and gilligan's island both had episodes portraying it,1
2057,i loved this movie it was adorably touching and funny finally here's a story about a group of people who meet some challenges flounder a bit and then decide to just be themselves and end up happy for when was the last time you saw that in a film dealing with the fluidity of life love and sexuality the characters are faced with real problems albeit in often ridiculous situations like the men's group camping trip and the explicit liaisons and manage to learn and grow without the movie getting preachy darkly desperate or too unrealistic you'll love and care about the characters who far from being hollow stereotypes portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their would be labels br br a good romcom for a saturday afternoon and the only movie i've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily and no one is forced to be anything they don't want to be far better than kissing jessica stein a good choice if your tired of watching gay movies that have some painful lesson and bitter lesson or maybe you just like a good british romp james purefoy looks dashing as always and tom hollander is deliciously funny so go forth watch enjoy you won't regret it,1
2058,i would say this is a background movie play it the background as your tending to busy work laundry checking email etc i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted wrong it was done in 2009 the screenplay script is pretty awful i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along it almost seems like it's a made for tv movie based on the cinematography am i watching a tv show br br even the secretary breaks out into song what the f is going on actually she seemed to have the best voice amy adams was so great in enchanted lead actor is average disappointed for sure this movie would have been good for lifetime but that's about it,0
2059,when i heard there was to be an abc australian broadcasting corporation mini series based on life in wwii pow camp with a focus on elements of comedy i was deeply sceptical and somewhat critical br br my father had served in the second world war such was the of the japanese he was able to talk about the horrors in and around where he was stationed until only quite recently along with my father i had been awarded the fortune of knowing many great men of stronger character and spirit than i shall ever have who had witnessed acts of unspeakable at the hands of the empire of japan and had never completely recovered the name is destined to conjure horrific images for ages to come br br but upon viewing i was highly impressed with the cast the characters and the complex plot lines of this wonderful series i now regard as the highlight of my week bear in mind i have viewed only three episodes so far i hope the remaining episodes adhere to the standards set by the first three br br the black humour works uncannily well however the flatulence jokes are a little overdone and while much of the horror has been suppressed the series comes quite close in relaying the spirit of the survivors who were able to later continue with their lives in spite of the memories br br the format of this series will be difficult for some to follow br br but i can not think of no better way to do adequate justice to the men who suffered deep emotional scarring proceeding when painfully suppressed experiences are remembered sometimes years after the horror br br one of the darkest chapters of the second world war the 20th century and i would go so far as to say in the history of mankind is being relayed to a new generation through this series and i hope it serves to relay the overwhelming adversity borne by the wartime generation br br proceeding i don't think i shall ever be able to listen to the poignant tune 'on the road to in the same way again tune in,1
2060,i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie not just because i'm a huge linnea quigley jill fan but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times br br the special effects are awesome especially scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed br br plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill plenty of humor cool soundtrack high body count etc by the way if you have never seen this one try and buy watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing,1
2061,the first in a new style of films for lamas no motorcycles or karate i for one miss them but this is a serious movie he plays a fbi profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone including himself gary busey is either a great actor or somebody i wouldn't want to meet in broad daylight on a crowded street kristen cloke pursues lamas as doggedly as she pursues the serial killer there is one surprise after another as the story unfolds not the least of which is the ending it seems to never come there is always one more layer to the story cloke and lamas start out as the good guys turn into the bad guys and somehow end up the heroes but it's definitely worth the rental price for maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar a bag of popcorn and a soft drink you're going to the movies,1
2062,admittedly i am not a fan of the monogram chan films the plot involving radium theft from a bank vault is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced mantan moreland and benson fong as no 3 son tommy provide some laughs as usual but otherwise there isn't much here great title that is wasted,0
2063,what symbolism exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother's paean to ingmar bergman some symbolism is there all right but not much northfork adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls br br northfork is a town facing extinction after a new dam goes into operation it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for the untouchables have the job of relocating dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving an exciting anti development movie is always a possibility but let's get real rural is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history can be built without forced relocation not in this country br br but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear br br alternating between the black suited evacuation agents working for land when the dam creates that valuable and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly br br the cinematography is poor a washed out subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly indeed a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective br br 4 10,0
2064,i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his real life dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a father son relationship that involves a real life father and son naturally there's an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that they're actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors i've seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is most intense role being that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks series and i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscar worthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williams the beautiful actress from the father of the bride movies is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors br br the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue that's obviously geared for the stage but that didn't bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film that's based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life br br the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky dory but that's not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up br br if you're in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off please check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together br br my score 9 out of 10,1
2065,i see alot of movies at the cinema 103 so far this year and i have to say that this is by far and away the best film i have seen this year even though it was released back in 1954 br br i sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that i had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print br br the best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist pure quality br br although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour br br not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort br br if you ever get a chance to see this movie please do not hesitate it's a classic br br,1
2066,this film does for infantry what das boot did for submariners if you appreciated das boot then that is all you really need to know br br this is a well done piece of cinema on a par with das boot basically it follows a company of elite german infantry who leave garrison duty in an idyllic italian seaside town and are immediately thrust into the chaos of the disintegrating russian front br br a good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and brutality of war and at the same time gives us insight into the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight this movie does that the film is full of drama and action and so is entertaining on that level as well,1
2067,i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan br br bad bad comeback by david dhawan he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag what a waste of talent and beauty it was why actors agree on movie like this br br there was not a whit of practicality in this movie the movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood has br br the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake i consider this to be the worst ever movie i seen awful 1 10,0
2068,no one said that in the big trail and i thought it would be a natural nevertheless this was one of the best westerns i have seen and i am a big fan of horses and gunsmoke movies the scope and feel of this picture is simply staggering and as someone mentioned in their comment it does have the feel of the 3 camera triptych of napoleon 1927 nowadays the cost of the production and especially the cast of thousands would be prohibitive but raoul walsh got it done br br the cast was excellent although john wayne was better when he had no lines and just around in particular tyrone power sr was a perfect villain i had never seen him before and this was his only talking picture ian keith was a snake but el is an acquired taste as the comic relief he can be funny or annoying but mostly the latter and he shows up at the most inappropriate times br br it is a bit too long and it took a while for the indians to show up but this is as close to a documentary on manifest destiny and as true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans regardless of genre preference by the time the settlers got to california i was exhausted,1
2069,having discovered the ring trilogy i have been gobbling up all those other japanese and korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon br br i don't have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though i can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense i'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when i just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen the film unnerved me so i became apprehensive of seeing things that i thought i was going to see br br it's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually it also provides food for thought and plenty of material to argue about when the film is over br br the characters are well defined to say the least could they make films like this in the west br br so it doesn't make sense in the end but when one has an appetite for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the otherworldly then no film is going to deliver a final all explaining pay off,1
2070,the lament and almost unbearable melancholy of music goes to a place in the soul that only music can stir in her voice and magical presence lies the exquisite agony of the an art form of which i was unaware until seeing this film br br for me the success of this beautifully and lovingly crafted documentary lies in the fact that the filmmaker resists the temptation to and simply allows us to share in the magnetism and elegant passion of this icon there seems to be an inevitable between the portuguese and american blues br br documentary filmmaking at its best transports us to a previously unknown reality and having been allowed this glimpse we are transformed br br sr de almeida,1
2071,how can so many blundering decisions can be made all that waste of resources its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse a loose interpretation are you kidding it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn i hope they were paid well,0
2072,i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney i left the theater like many others before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer it was badly shot the sound sucks and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states this screams of a low budget high school production,0
2073,if this movie had a point i never discovered it a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks br br the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning but much is left to the viewer's speculation in the movie another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters another group of people are departing some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it br br the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting and the stories are weird in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah's ark br br another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them br br the scenery was stark and the sun never shines there are snowy mountains in the far distance i guess the purpose was to set the mood the time period is set by the fact that the all drove ford of the 1946 48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955 the acting was mediocre when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture if she was i didn't recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady,0
2074,i'm always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called also that nobody nobody i've read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and nietzsche's famous work also the idea of man's rebirth into a star child an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being is an explicit part of n 's there is a prominent passage called on how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child in which n describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child transcending both the altruistic side of man the camel always asking to bear more weight and the rapacious brutish will to power side of man the lion the fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence and also said that man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman the structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the overman the of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also nietzschean in he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider to show us how to go under bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near end could be seen as kubrick's best 1960's style attempt at depicting the mystical going under br br i know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that i have not personally seen it but i just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion explicitly and unmistakeably nietzschean the case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of updated for the modern age feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to nietzsche,1
2075,mario van peebles tries to go the jean claude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself however the government isn't going to take this lying down so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film this blatant rip off of universal soldier which is far more fun then this simply goes nowhere the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert van peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass kicking to justify a viewing on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of r o t o r although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences also like r o t o r it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work because the material is too dull in all regards solo is a very weak film br br 1 2 out of 4 poor,0
2076,frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can't hollywood get nancy kwan instead at least its more true to the story cos for goodness sake dr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in person br br and looking at the whole cast so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too br br i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloney br br its just like another movie i know of ' the imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan br br and to make matter worst how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian come up with a alabama southern accent and a cheap imitation of anything asian br br good grief br br i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show br br would love to see that br br and laugh the whole roof off br br cheers,0
2077,the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime solving duo the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic but also a prime suspect in this death and some other murders that occur at the theatre 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim so it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis br br milton screenplay puts a little spark in this low budget mystery whodunit helpfully dave o'brien as anthony tony woolrich does well in the lead role his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks as egbert romeo would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team leading lady kay aldridge as claudia moore and the supporting cast are also good unfortunately the story becomes meandering and anti climactic br br the phantom of 42nd street 5 2 45 albert herman dave o'brien kay aldridge frank jenks,0
2078,i thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously just sit back and enjoy hilary swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to boston ma i also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength plus mr was so sweet i wish he'd teach me karate,1
2079,take a subject i didn't know much about and make it exciting why don't you it so happens that back about 1979 director robert altman said that he didn't believe he had ever made a real movie and that he expected that one of these kids riding skateboards if he doesn't break his neck will make the first movie well i wouldn't put such an expectation on stacy peralta but he is a skateboarder who has made a good movie of course he was forced by the nature of the film he was making to use existing footage and it is certainly a good thing that so much archival footage existed peralta edited it together well with not your usual talking head shots of his erstwhile colleagues as they are today the whole effect is post modern in the best sense but that has been done altman's prediction hasn't quite come true what peralta has done however is capture enough of the energy of those heady days that we can appreciate what it must have been like when modern skateboarding was invented by the z boys this is all good i highly recommend dogtown,1
2080,it is the best movie on acting i have ever seen all the artists are old turkish theater actors they are magnificent in this movie it is sometimes said that they do not act they live it you can really see this in this movie the director is also competent you cannot see lots of moving cameras around but the positions of the cameras are also good but after the acting the most outstanding part is the content of the movie it gives happiness enthusiasm desire to live importance of real friends to people we all started to live individually nowadays in this film you see that there are someone other then us and most importantly you see that the most honorable feeling in the world is love loving your friends loving your darling all people should see this movie,1
2081,i should know better i've seen too many of rob lowe's early work to expect anything good from this movie even if it is about hockey br br here we have yet again another tired sports theme kid has potential for greatness has the apparent to go far if his cocky attitude doesn't screw things up and boom he comes out of it as that helluva player kind of champion is that all that can be said of sports movies surely there must be other feats that athletes undertake br br nonetheless this movie has got to be one of the biggest everybody's interactions are just downright silly and not in a stupid funny kind of manner and i can't think of any ancillary qualities that could enliven my position not the actors certainly not swayze who plays lowe's reluctant mentor not the story not the music and very little from the skating sequences br br normally i'm a sucker for 80s movies even if they do tend to be a little fishy i e north shore the karate kid but this doesn't even make for good 80s trash for a good 80s sports movie check elsewhere there's plenty of them out there,0
2082,oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies i don't even remember how many i've seen maybe it sells but not to me not scary at all the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these also the pulling of the kid i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies cellphone scene is also nothing new the of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked i mean it lacked all ok this is for kids 14 16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique we'll let me tell you there's a million of you d this is one of them 3 10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by not seeing this,0
2083,for one used to the comedies on television now whether sketch sitcom or animated it's nice to watch something truly refreshing br br the chaser has to be the best comedy of this decade seinfeld being the triumph it follows the hosts urban crusades to fix situations do road and try to get the facts from our politicians the good old fashioned way br br despite being very controversial at times the shows excellent quality from the well made and truly funny opening credits to the sketch style investigations sketch style only in time they are not scripted at least not the ones at the other end of the joke is certainly worth watching even the most cynical and intellectual viewer won't be disappointed and the show deserves ten stars br br all in all well done to the abc for showing this and i recommend it highly,1
2084,if b movies tired and corny scripts and golf carts dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment you'll probably enjoy this otherwise forget it the topless though completely irrelevant did give a few seconds of amusement,0
2085,first the premise stinks little boy likes to dress in girls clothes it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood the jokes are lame and old you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's 60's films the whole cast is wasted i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley maclaine vehicle please would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two mules for sister sara see it if there's no reruns of andy griffith on,0
2086,i'm 15 usually not kids my age usually watch these old classic movies but this is one of my favorites i was totally addicted after watching it for the first time it's really good if u think about technology and movies back at that time music is great storyline is ok choreography is great must see it i don't know why there's a prequel for this movie not many people like this movie but i love classic love movies they're so much better than movies now this movie will make you smile cry and make you start dancing the music is absolutely ear catching and beautiful i haven't seen dirty dancing 2 nights prequel prequel should have star the original actors thats what i hate about prequels they ruin the original no one wants a prequel they want a sequel many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the 3rd one is enough beyond that people wont be bothered to watch it who remembers the movie about the st benard beethoven i think there's 5 movies altogether,1
2087,this is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province it takes everybody into a first person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything maurice richard the book does this as well as the short and i'm glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school this was required reading in both languages br br i thought it was brilliant to have carrier narrate this story his molasses thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story the animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone by br br again as a symbol of culture this is unsurpassed one can almost smell the being cooked slowly over a wood stove this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots i'm from ontario and this film made me fall in love with quebec maurice richard va vivre dans nos,1
2088,this is the worst movie of all time it's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1 3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet if you actually watch the whole thing god help you,0
2089,ok so there's always people out there that seem to make it a point not to like movies because they're good but instead choose to like movies based on how depressing or boring they can be or whether they're from a foreign country all that aside one crazy summer is the perfect example of what a great american teen comedy should be the jokes are a good mix of slapstick a la bobcat goldthwait surreal bobcat under the inspired direction of steve holland and dry john cusack one of the most dry and funny actors in american cinema and there is no character in this movie who does not deliver at least one funny line ok except demi moore br br yes it's immature yes it's screw ball yes bobcat dresses up like godzilla and trashes a scale model of a seafood restaurant it's also funny as hell watch it,1
2090,first i must say that i don't speak spanish and usually do not enjoy spanish speaking films but two coyotes is an exceptional film there is enough action and hard drama that it doesn't matter that its a spanish speaking film the subtitles were easy to read and didn't block the action or the drama br br i would tell fans of spanish speaking films and non fans of spanish speaking films to go see this movie the action and drama are worth every penny br br,1
2091,i first saw this in the theater in 1969 when i was 9 and immediately fell in love with it i'm sad that sony has not seen fit to release this on dvd but one day one day i recently obtained a vhs copy of this on ebay and sat down to watch it 39 years later i'm happy to report it still stands the test of time the acting is spot on john williams' orchestrations are lush and leslie songs memorable when i am older you and i fill the world with love london is london are just a few of the standouts and not enough can be said about peter o' toole clarke michael redgrave and michael acting terence rattigan deserves an a for his update of the james hilton story there really is nothing not to like about this film it's a good cheer me up selection glad they have released the original soundtrack as a three cd set with lots of extras wish sony would hurry up and do the same with the film,1
2092,the worst part of all is the poor scripting leading to superficial acting br br dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match br br holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self centered and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting as usual br br brad johnson was wooden john goodman made the best of it br br furthermore the whole death ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone and now appears rather lame br br barely watchable only if you like old,0
2093,john career as a film director was extraordinary we had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently the film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principals br br if you haven't seen it please don't read any further br br chris and were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds chris went to enter a seminary to be a priest but gives up became a small time drug user and trafficker the two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in an illegal activity that will prove their short sightedness in fact it shows how both young men miscalculate in their attempt to fool the cia and the soviet union these two in a way were so naive in thinking they could pull something that bigger and better equipped people couldn't even imagine could be done br br chris' motivation is legitimate as he feels outraged in discovering the underhanded role of the agency for which he works in dealing with other nations in this case australia something he finds by sheer coincidence when he involves we know the whole thing is doomed because no one into drugs as he is will ever amount to anything in fact chris and had no conception of the scope of what they are trying to do or its consequences br br timothy hutton was at this period of his career an actor that was going places he had proved he had talent with his work in other films so it was a natural choice for mr schlesinger to select him a choice that pays off well sean penn also was a young actor who showed an intensity like one hadn't seen before in fact at times mr penn reminded us of a young robert mitchum in the making both actors' contribution to the film is incredible one can't think who could have played this duo but them br br the falcon and the snowman while not up to the par with other great john schlesinger's movies is an interesting look to our not too distant past,1
2094,this movie has too many things going on another reviewer comments on the disjointed episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director's memories that's fine if that is how it was written and performed instead what we get is straight forward narrative some of the time that jumps around under and over leaves us dangling in some instances interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances and otherwise simply doesn't work br br there are also some plot details that just don't work for example why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight as opposed to night time why leave your flat sheet on the body why would an artist who knew the joe character for a brief time decide to leave him everything even if it wasn't much this sub plot was poorly developed to make that point work for that matter why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes he could just as easily have been a photographer or a opera composer for that matter how does someone rate an apartment in an opera house particularly without some clear connection to the opera the coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and disappear if tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as how could joe lose track of him for 8 years especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job br br some of the other subplots like the mother and her boyfriend s and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding there's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts as completed this movie made little sense and offers even less,0
2095,not many people have seen this film and it is a shame because it is a work of art the characters are brilliant the dialogue is sensational and the use of themes leaves the audience wondering i truly loved this film and can't wait to see more of matthew george's work,1
2096,this is one awful movie some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree the monster is amazingly cheap and funny looking but this is something we all knew i guess in addition to that the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible br br as bad as it is this movie as the quality of being entertaining not always for the good reasons but it's a good so bad that it's fun flick br br by the way there's no such thing as la according to a secondary character in the film named pierre described in the movie as a french canadian there's a legend among french canadians about a giant bird know as la as a french canadian myself i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend it sure made me laugh though,0
2097,working in a music store my first tipped me this soundtrack the music of this movie is perfect one of my favorite cd's only years later i saw the movie i was afraid it would not fulfill my high expectations luckily it did a feel good romantic love story,1
2098,having already seen the original jack frost i never thought that jack frost 2 would be as absurd as it is boy was i wrong then again a pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material even worse than you might expect i believe this is the first a pix sequel and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future more a pix sequels br br it's hard to watch this without laughing especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring which are essentially snowballs with eyes arms a mouth and sharp teeth start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it they are shown both as puppets with a stick underneath to move them and as computer animation which i have to say looks very cheesy the computer animation surprised me as the first jack frost had no such effects br br i'd strongly recommend that you see the original jack frost before seeing this one both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends to get the full amusement out of it and because it would make more sense sense being a relative term br br now only if there was uncle sam 2,0
2099,i first saw this film in austria when it first came out and i was entranced by it it is a passionate and deeply moving work that should be experienced by all connoisseurs of motion picture art what a shame that it has never been released in dvd format perhaps one of these days that will be rectified as it would be a shame indeed if one of the best films ever made was forgotten and left to fade away in some film vault forever br br why is it that 'b' movies like 'american wedding' and get widescreen and fullscreen releases and often a special edition with multiple commentaries and extras while great art pieces like 'the dead' are all but forgotten,1
2100,it was inferred by a previous poster that the military would not be subordinate to the police in a disaster as depicted in the film in fact the military role would be to supply aid to the civil authorities when requested to do so the civil authorities would retain in practise the army would need 48 hours or so to mobilise themselves there not being much army presence in london especially with current overseas commitments even then they would be dependent on calling in the ta br br as for cobra we were given the impression that it was a full governmental emergency department in its own right even reference to a met police cobra division in fact cobra stands for cabinet office briefing room a it's just the room where the pm or meet their advisers to discuss the current emergency,0
2101,maybe spoilers hard to spoil this thing more then it is but just in case gee's i don't see how anybody could have liked this re make it was like a made for t v show and still pretty lame for that lots of fake snow bad acting by top stars bad action and that crazy pine forest in detroit what the heck i didn't really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained nope we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day i could have skipped the rest easy but then i would have missed those great woods i'm so glad i missed this at the theater bad enough to have wasted 3 50 at the video store and i am a lover of cop action and drama films this was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars give me the original any day,0
2102,although dated this film is definitely worth a watch i saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life i just had to live in new york it has great opening shots of the manhattan skyline with johnny mathis crooning romance is still the best of everything that rival those of west side story there is a rather stilted performance by the world's real first supermodel suzy parker sorry about that janice d but it's great eye candy it also offers a bit of insight into late 1950's american mores our obsession with and repression of sex in the workplace no less romance and marriage before women's lib it represents an era in which new york was at it's finest and a super bitchy performance by joan crawford is just the icing on the cake,1
2103,muscular unpleasantly thin females in swimsuits lots of beer drinking yet it's too long to be a beer commercial oh okay there's some plot about a big shark like monster that's killing people and stuff but it's nothing you haven't seen before,0
2104,ed harris and cuba gooding jr where cast perfectly in this film it's a heart warming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care i think there was a lot of realism with the characters the screenwriter didn't incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which i thought created a more realistic story line br br writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard br br there are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously ed harris should have been nominated for an academy award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a father and showed a warm caring side when helping radio,1
2105,this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies in the history of cinema the screenplay is really well done which is not often the case for this type of movies and you can see that chuck in one of his first role is a great actor the final fight with the sherif deputy in the is a masterpiece,0
2106,attractive husband and wife writing team robert wagner as joel gregory and kate jackson as donna gregory arrive at the spooky mansion of actress lorna love actually silent film star harold lloyd's house mr wagner and ms jackson are contracted to write the silent movie star's biography wagner has a personal interest in the project since his father was once the famed star's lover mysterious events unfold and jackson must fight to save her husband from the spirit of the beautiful blonde who is perfectly preserved in a crypt on the estate moreover the evil woman seems bent on possessing her husband and murdering jackson br br this is very much a night of dark shadows variation co starring genuine dark shadows alumni kate jackson who knows and plays her part well robert wagner lacks david selby's intensity sylvia sidney as mrs josephs sidesteps grayson hall hill is not a match for lara parker or diana bill macy as oscar payne is good in a part that would have been played by john in a dan curtis production br br there are smooth cameos by joan blondell john carradine and dorothy lamour ms delivery resembles joan bennett which begs the question why didn't producer aaron spelling get more of the original dark shadows regulars br br director e w was bridget husband he worked with ms blondell on here come the brides and with jackson on the rookies death at love house has arguably a tighter storyline than the night of dark shadows film it differs in the movie star angle and in its father eternal fire ending it more closely resembles the laura the phoenix storyline br br death at love house 9 3 76 e w robert wagner kate jackson sylvia sidney,0
2107,after hoo american indians scalp number one son frontiersman bruce bennett as daniel boone seems at first like he wants to get even but he really wants to make friends with the natives when sad eyed indian chief lon chaney jr as also loses number one son it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings apparently this was republic pictures' attempt to do for their daniel boone trail blazer what disney studio's had successfully done with davy crockett king of the wild frontier 1955 br br the dan'l boone song whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon did not follow fess parker's davy crockett up the hit parade singer young as doesn't perform the title song perhaps wisely he does sing long green valley and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone's daughter but spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film's most valuable player in a cute scene mr fernandez reminds mr young the name of the character susannah he is supposed to be in love with br br daniel boone trail blazer 10 5 56 ismael rodríguez bruce bennett lon chaney jr young freddy fernandez,0
2108,for those of you who like stand up comedians you must have heard about george carlin he is really one of the best comedians alive so you must know him br br but he died already god rest him in peace or hell he didn't believe too much in religion so he might as well chose hell to live eternity haha just joking don't take it serious br br it's bad for ya it's one of the latest works of george carlin before his death br br believe me one of his best works a must for any fan and an almost best of of all george carlin's jokes it's not a best of but it's really amusing br br it has less political and religious jokes it's only to have a great time br br editing is very good it's not a concert so it shouldn't have quick changing of shots the slow fading to other shot was well done fading is the best option in terms of editing,1
2109,this conglomeration fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say it doesn't merit one line much less ten but to adhere to the rules of imdb here goes and i probably won't succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this submission to be accepted lol br br if i had seen this schlock during the '70s while i was going through my mushroom phase i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed i was on the edge of my seat br br one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess as if that were a red letter day in his life one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life get a grip amigo,0
2110,sure it's hard being gay especially in the south we get it over and over again br br what stood out was that the film makers focused almost wholly on the more extreme characters in these small town gay bars the drag queens the seedy sleaze of a bar long closed and on a guy who was brutally murdered for being gay yet had nothing to do with either of the bars which were the focus of this film br br there were snippets of interviews from other people people viewers would perhaps be better able to relate to but they were glossed over practically skipped maybe shown in a glimpse in the background br br it would have been more interesting to me at least to hear the experiences of the more common gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise by the experiences of a small town gay bar and or the absence of that community,0
2111,i am a big fan of auntie mame with rosalind russell she really was the perfect actress to play that character br br i've heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in mame but it's hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russell br br lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really they should have dubbed her singing voice hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect br br i just saw the stage revival in washington d c and i think christine baranski was very good as mame harriet harris the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier played vera and she was particularly good br br both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show maybe if that production makes it to broadway they'll consider filming it br br also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes,0
2112,i can't remember when i've seen a worse movie the acting was overwrought the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to the special effects second rate and the overall story laughable br br i've never wanted to walk out on a movie more and if i'd been alone that's what i'd have done about 30 minutes into it and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of nausea inducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese the size of texas i just can't what a miserable experience sitting through this waste of perfectly good celluloid was br br,0
2113,yeesh talk about craptastic this thing is brutal horrible voice dubbing even more horrible acting and no discernible plot apparently there are some great chase scenes but the problem is you have to get to that point first and i just couldn't the 20 or so minutes i endured felt more like a root canal than a movie i suppose i could have fast forwarded it and i recommend you do the same unless you have very extreme pain tolerance or your a masochist i don't fall into either category i still have a migraine from this thing so i'm about to perform some dental surgery without anesthetic just relive the migraine bottom line horrendous 0 10,0
2114,possibly the worst movie i ever saw the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light you can't see anything in this movie it is way to dark the parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares so you still can't see this movie should have been a radio play or something some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect low budget movies can be done so much better then this and low budget is no excuse for this an editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can't see the awful acting it also covers up the crappy sfx people at beginner film schools make better movies then this movies shot with handy cams look better then this,0
2115,i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie but this was so awful i had to make an exception br br i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like there just wasn't anything here to like br br i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student but even considering that the sets and effect are bad the cinematography is mediocre but may be the best part of the movie br br the acting is bad a sad state when the female voice over for the computer is the best actor the dialogue is bad the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent br br the humor is not just subtle and sublime it's nowhere to be found as an example a whole 20 minutes of the 80 minute film is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator br br this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50's scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50's scifi c movie at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously,0
2116,i would give this movie high marks for the cinema photography and performances i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving courtesan who the lead character i remember a mini biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it apparently she was a holocaust refugee discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty she died very young and under tragic circumstances gene tierney is also outstanding in this film like other neo biblical films of the 1940's and 50s the egyptian reflects the morals and values of that time but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told,1
2117,the warmest most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself a brilliant screenplay by david one of my favorites see the warriors and for more and beautiful sets filmed on location i think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you can't see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it,1
2118,i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scott's film the there was no introduction by scott before the film it just started right up br br boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scott's other work it bears no resemblance the film shows a boy played by tony scott riding around on a bicycle guess what that's pretty all that happens the boy rides around rambling on and on with pointless confusing dialogue the film was shot in black and white and since it was directed by ridley scott i expected some cool cinematography or visually striking sets instead i was treated with nothing this film isn't even good for a first effort however i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once,0
2119,the first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the willis character were pretty enjoyable especially with jean smart but it really tanked after that this is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all i know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that willis was just as irritating in his younger self but i found this kid especially irritating and,0
2120,even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch what was this a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a lady who was also on some heavy street drugs for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs you will love this movie,0
2121,bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its 1 movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes it's grotesuque and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this,0
2122,olivier film stars asia argento as a woman who had a relationship with michael madsen madsen is a business man who's in financial trouble in desperation he is going to sell his share of a business to a company called golden eagle a company from the far east as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life the pair had a torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen with said golden eagle once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she's woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control br br i'm not a fan actually i was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which i kept wondering what the point was other than to provide a meaty role for argento argento daughter of director dario argento and a director in her own right is a unique actress at times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you a quirky off beat portrayal of a damaged human being sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't i don't think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it i didn't care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way she seemed more nut job than anything else i'm not blaming the actors but writer director assayas who has once again constructed a complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don't really work br br if you must try it on cable,0
2123,irwin allen put all his talents behind this one he's co screenwriter producer and director of this cartoonish epic about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth potentially exciting story fails to take off despite an eclectic cast varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color but this soggy sci fi is pretty cheesy good for a few stray laughs but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong solid adventure and campy nonsense later a popular tv series from,0
2124,if you think about it it's nearly unbelievable that a film could be made about the death penalty one of the world's most controversial topics that offends neither those for nor against it's a testament to tim robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity traits that can be seen in his acting roles as well shawshank redemption jacob's ladder br br this film in fact hints at a subtle compromise between the for and against camps so subtle that it can't be put into words subtle to the point of vanishing yet one gets the sense after watching the picture that a compromise is possible that somehow it can be worked out if only we look deeply enough,1
2125,this movie gives daniel wu his chance to do a great action movie but i really find emil chow's character really great gutsy but determined to righting wrongs plus the main terrorist it gets me wondering his revolution makes me wonder if he is doing this for good or bad br br a movie that tells us about todd an amnesiac terrorist being tricked as an undercover until he learns who he really is the consequences that he makes from his terrorist family gives him a the choice of redemption br br purple storm was one of the best ones that i have seen this year the movie really stands out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set up by stephen tung wai which won the best action sequences in the hong kong awards 9 10,1
2126,we have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3 30am and we haven't stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value right from the outset with the thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion we were laughing is it me or does that chick from knott's landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal br br i'm not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i don't think its clever enough for double bluffs br br this has to be the worst best film we have ever seen if we'd been playing the 'spot the cliché' drinking game then we be wasted by now,0
2127,i like hack think the lone ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver a decent but flawed guy in philadelphia doing his best while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past and you've got the synopsis david morse is nearly perfect as he helps people but instead of riding silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary philly without handing out silver bullets the supporting cast is first class and well above average at times the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series the rockford files this show deserves a return hopefully in a better time slot than 9pm friday eastern,1
2128,i must say i found this movie very disappointing yes i know maltin gave it 3 1 2 and others think very highly of it but well the opera sequences were god awful i take it macdonald is an acquired taste yes in the short sequences i have seen her with nelson eddy she is immensely preferable to him but on her own god i dislike opera and despise operetta and she is basically intolerable at one point i had to cover my ears gable is just ok and tracy is thrown away the plot is annoying in the jm never simply tells gable she loves him and the opera and why can't she do both instead she suffers silently or not so with the compromises she makes the supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable besides the star three and jack holt and i suppose his mother they all are just background and forgettable the sequence is the only thing that saves the movie and just yes it is fairly spectacular and moving but the oh god is great seems very contrived i immensely prefer in old chicago as far as old time disaster spectaculars go spare yourself on this one,0
2129,this little cheapy is notable only because it is the worst film abbott and costello ever made it is dreadful in every way crummy music horrid choreography check out the awkward lead male dancer cheesy special effects and sets wooden actors the leads are barely at the high school level in their profession and were unheard of later and a script without a single laugh better times were ahead for the comedy duo abbott and costello meet captain kidd is much preferable as is the television series which at times was inspired but skip this one,0
2130,while driving in a highway to the wedding of his beloved betty ann adam eric is surprised by his former schoolmate harley justin urich on the backseat of his car adam has broken off with the inconvenient and moron harley because of betty ann along their road trip harley makes fun of some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monster truck on the road after some incidents they give a lift to the hitchhiker sarah aimee brooks and sooner the trio is terrorized by a scary monster driving the monster truck br br in spite of having one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a horror movie the irritating harley monster man is a surprisingly good trash horror comedy the story is a collection of clichés beginning like joy ride or duel then it turns to one of the countless rip offs of the texas chainsaw massacre there is a surprising twist ending with a hook for a sequel there are hilarious scenes aimee brooks is extremely sexy and this film really entertains my vote is seven br br title brazil monster man,1
2131,multiply named and strangely casted one dark night aka mausoleum is one of the better early horror video rentals original and quite raw we meet adam west briefly in this film about telekinesis and teen age meg tilly is dared into spending the night in a crypt by the sisters a high school gang of hair hoppers in blue satin jackets the initiation is interrupted by the recently interred body of a mass murdering psychic wizard called surprisingly awesome make up and scare effects paints this chiller film with style and deliver a heart pounding climax,1
2132,i found this movie to be a big disappointment especially considering the cast the characters are not believable as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves the only part of the film i enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally get killed the special effects consist mostly of scenes of gory dead or dying bodies a typical unimaginative slasher flick br br it's hard to believe make that impossible to believe that a reclusive creature that sneaks up on goats in the middle of the night could be captured by a group of clumsy noisy idiots equally impossible to believe is how they knew exactly were to find it in spite of the fact the creature has capture or even photographing br br the man that pulls off the impossible in capturing the alive is our one dimensional dr pena giancarlo esposito the only thing dr pena is more obsessed with than the creature is his dart gun a dart gun that works were mere bullets fail br br the captain of the ship john rhys davies is introduced as a 'war he employs his military prowess by having his men shoot at the creature regardless of were on the ship they happen to be the navy seals that show up from nowhere repeat the pattern of shooting at everything br br dylan neal plays an insurance investigator brought on board the cruise ship to catch a thief he spends most of the movie tagging along with whomever is trying to kill the creature at the moment br br the creature doesn't even closely resemble a it doesn't behave like one either instead of a small shy secretive animal that hunts by stealth at night we get a bulletproof freddy kruger killing everything in sight a simple search on google would have been very helpful to the writers and the special effects crew,0
2133,as a sci fi movies fan i also like alien but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien resurrection it well into alien series but it isn't alien it's something else ok enough comparisons this movie but me think why people are afraid of dark you can't run away from dark it's impossible you have to be faced with darkness and with that what's in dark in this movie i also liked that the vin diesel character richard b riddick wasn't typical good boy he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all first of all he want to get out of that planet himself there is also other metaphors in this story every big sci fi fan should see this picture,1
2134,another raquel welch classic this picture hit the theaters november 10 1969 starring raquel welch as michele james stacey as joe and luke askew as alan morris nikki is on her way to meet with her girl friends michele and jackie while on her way there she runs into her ex husband who wants a second chance nikki walk away from him goes to the table where she sees michele and jackie alan approaches her again and she starts to walk away when alan shoots her in the back nikki is taken to the hospital while michele and jackie go to the police station michele goes to the hospital where she meets up with jackie only to find that nikki died alan then goes after jackie who he hits with a car and then tries to run michele down michele jumps into her car and heads for los angeles when she gets there she calls lloyd her boss in las vegas to let him know that she was all right lloyd tells her to go to the club called the losers to see jeri about a job however there's one problem the bartender has a drug problem and alan knows it so alan and the bartender have a little talk back in los angeles michele not only gets a job as a dancer with jeri but also hooks up with jeri bouncer joe now some thoughts on this picture this picture was far better then raquel last and this one had nonstop action luke askew did a fine job of playing nikki ex husband he was your typical murder with the look that goes with it as for raquel welch performance the only word that comes to mine is fantastic she was awesome in this movie and her beauty stood out and shined like never before the outfit that she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking in fact all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking of course it doesn't matter what raquel had on because she looks good in everything or nothing i give this movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons the first and by far is raquel welch who's the leading actress and deserves 10 stars the second reason is that this movie was wall to wall excitement from beginning to end,1
2135,this is the result of the town of california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie part comedy part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage the monster which we don't see until the final 20 minutes is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end this is a stinker,0
2136,this is a terrible movie and i'm not even sure why it's so terrible it's ugly for one with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product the film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit but the songs sound lifeless on screen but mostly the movie sucks because of the wan performance of lucille ball who you'd think would be able to make something of this larger than life character if anyone could she sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking on her opening night and the film sinks with her even bea arthur who i bet was hilarious in the best friend role onstage can't breathe any life into this stinker br br avoid at all costs br br grade d,0
2137,great little ground breaking movie in 1955 about an important subject br br i wasn't expecting much from sinatra's performance and was pleasantly surprised by it loved kim novak she was gorgeous br br loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein as great as that by schifrin for bullitt i am very surprised it doesn't seem available on cd if anyone knows about the soundtrack's availability on any other format they should post it here somewhere br br preminger's direction was as usual borderline flawless br br haven't read nelson novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it the subplot of frankie as a hot card dealer was a bit of a surprise too as were a few other things but see for yourself it's very much worth seeing,1
2138,three words what a pile two words don't bother one word sucked there are zero reasons to see this movie even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie the martial arts the typical aikido are horrible the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his kill move to his victims worse yet is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles how stupid seagal's acting was plain stupid but i still give this movie a 6 for acting because of the supporting cast whose villain roles were actually quite entertaining br br the plot is just dumb seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time at no extra charge and nothing stands in his way not assassins political leaders explosions or even death br br i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it no one should bother with this tripe br br,0
2139,recently released on british dvd this is a good movie as long as you have an attention span and iq of more than a fruit fly not as depressing as it could have been this is kitchen sink at its most dirty terrance stamp is great in it the music is sweet carol white is very believeable as the single mum tart who can't stop loving criminals br br my favourite scene is where carol and her friend who works in the pub with her the one with the enormous beehive hairdo which comes down over one eye sit and gossip about all the men who walk past br br the only thing that marred this was the shakey acting of carol's first husband but if you can get past that you're ok and donovan provides some of the most languid mellow bittersweet lyrics to come out of the 60s,1
2140,a perennial fixture in the imdb bottom 100 upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going br br take the editing for a start to call this choppy would be overly complimentary indeed had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here added to this the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax br br aside from the ever game michael poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly yay verily all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one br br deary deary me and to think that lamberto bava directed this to tut tut indeed br br note this was released in the uk under the alternative title of devouring waves although bereft of most of its gore scenes which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching,0
2141,i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the alamo in austin he prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was hilarious i can see how it would be damaging to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee they don't come until after the halfway point but when they do oh god you will die oh and jim brown is brilliant he's not in a lot of the movie but when he's there you know whose movie it is naturally the best line in the movie and the funniest is his you'll know it when you hear it,1
2142,i appear to be in the minority but i thought radio was pretty awful it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of heartwarming movies br br the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples br br you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away when the movie wanted you to go awww or pull out your tissue i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching rudy instead br br there were some good performances by the cast too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear,0
2143,worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really p s watch the carrot,1
2144,two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful by the colonel played by ron perlman the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages,1
2145,recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the entire family without resorting to preaching or hollywood sappy endings tony drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way br br highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances i had presumed before watching the drama that i would see some of their previous on screen relationship in blackpool bleed through but it never does neither actor is recognizable from any previous work and i didn't see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes in addition harry performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic throughout the piece he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house br br at times nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic as the viewer i wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality stop moping and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives but under the same circumstances i see myself acting like any of them switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything including behavior that is completely unlike myself it's the show's greatest strength truth without sugar coating to force us all to think what we'd be able to do under the same circumstances br br this is a difficult but must watch show i hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the u s,1
2146,in love 2 is the third movie it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one at the risk of giving out spoilers is kidnapped and the team has to get him back nothing new there a past love of is the bad guy that was done in the second movie the battle between and ryoko and is starting to get boring the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy i personally don't know what it's makers were thinking i gave this movie a vote of 4,0
2147,i was ten years old when i saw subspecies i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate they really do have some great on screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie i ordered a copy back in 1993 from full moon and i learned this ion and rosa the servants have much bigger roles in the screenplay along with the king what most people don't know is that there was an alternate sequence that was supposed to occur in the ending scene michelle and stefan get cornered into a room and michelle has the idea for stefan to make her a vampire to help fight off and her demonic controlled ex friends however for some reason or another that scenario never made it on camera another scene in the script that can be confirmed from the original trailer shows stefan drinking blood from a wolf or actually in the trailer you see him coming up with blood on his chin br br this movie gets a 9 because it's one from my childhood and i have fond memories attached to the characters even though my favorite characters were stefan and michelle i think anders is pure feeling evocative acting so much feeling in his work there,1
2148,i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams back in the early days at comedy central back in those days the 90's their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k complete with bearded host br br capt frank played by the stone faced dead pan leslie nielson is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think dragnet meets starsky hutch the show boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios this is distilled 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz for now save it for later frank is clueless at most times a terrible driver a terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he is a master of the police investigative methodology a k a ask johnny the old shoe shine boy this does not make him a bad cop cops get lucky also capt notice he's a captain here has perfected it along with his partner and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes br br the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly the magic never came from the sight gags however at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background the movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series think of monty python's and now for something completely different br br if you liked airplane 1 2 naked gun 1 2 3 or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this br br i always liked the series better than the movies even though i saw the movies first why 2 words no o j,1
2149,do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made stop wondering i'm telling you michael is it br br it is not heartwarming entertaining or travolta at his best it just sucks if i had kids i would let them watch deep throat before michael br br a sold out john travolta a washed up and balding william hurt and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film br br but wait you'll get to hear andie mcdowell sing yeah hollywood really s t all over us with this one,0
2150,van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books from the setting of mexico to the five star fight scenes this movie was amazing the film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of mexico ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of mexico into the united states of america usa van damme and scott atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action acting and the film a five star look i always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better keep them coming van damme br br watch this film if you enjoyed films like until death the hard corps and second in command,1
2151,this is based on michael's life from 1983 4 till 2004 flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don't believe he was even though he trusted the wrong people at times i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white i think should of been portrayed in this she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley's son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child it was idea for the two to get married,0
2152,boogie nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director this film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people this movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over,1
2153,spending an hour seeing this brilliant dan finnerty and his dan band perform their special on bravo is the most enjoyable hour i've ever spent watching tv this young man dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer he can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hip hop rock also songs written for women this guy can do anything i've seen him live at least 11 times so i was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of dan's overwhelming star quality do yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it,1
2154,this was a sordid and dreary mess i needed a shower when it was over it goes something like this some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information since the detective is an attractive woman of course she is horny and intrigued which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting just depressing and yucky ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross dressing psychiatrist which is why it escapes a one star rating,0
2155,this new movie by is awesome check it out and you'll be amazed the story of emily waters once a girl from a broken home whose only means of escape from an abusive father was through her until one night her drawings manifested into reality and saved her and now using this power she fights against those who would do evil both live action film and hand drawn animation blend together to create a unique and original experience that will shake your soul and blow you away the music is incredible as well it really the emotional experience and draws you deep into the conflict directed by jesse and animated by erica starring the beautiful marissa with music by nico rowland daniel collins jeff matt and support this film and support he is a very talented guy go see his film shades of grey as well,1
2156,how can anybody give this anything higher than a '1' br br i thought manos the hands of fate would forever be the worst movie ever to itself upon my optic nerve indeed i didn't think anything could be worse br br i was wrong galaxina is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly agonizingly blindingly bad how often have you watched a movie and commented who the hell lit this thing from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to well everything this movie is absolutely unendurable it's so bad i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen br br it's too bad even to be laughable i'd sooner eat a of broken glass than sit through it again,0
2157,tries to be funny scary tense and romantic and fails in every respect the acting is average at best but mostly stupid the special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices and the chemistry between any character is juvenile br br if you don't want to be mad at yourself don't pay money to see it,0
2158,this is one of those movies you find when you stay up too late and only have basic cable it's hard to believe this movie was made in '95 considering it looks like something out of the late 80s plucky youngsters with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who's on a mission to make the best flavor ever soylent cream br br this movie is extremely demented and is only scary in how creepy and absolutely ridiculously gross it is actually the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home the fact that these kids have no escape from their silent suburban sufferings makes any random loony loose in the neighborhood seem like a walk in the park br br the most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical fat kid is so obviously a slim pre teen with a mountain of padding under his baggy i guess that either a they hadn't invented couldn't afford a fat suit b the casting director was too lazy to find a pudgy child star or c we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is starving and has an enormously distended belly br br so if you're up at 2 am and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip on with your intoxicated friends go ahead and take a look personally i'd rather be sleeping,0
2159,if you don't mind subtitles you like comedy and truly interesting characters along with a taste of something different from mainstream american cinema then take a chance and rent this film br br two contrasting friends one very neurotic sweater the other the strong quiet loner type working for a jerk butcher in a smaller danish town decide to strike out on they're own together and open a butcher shop themselves not successful at first they incorporate something new to they're recipe and become an instant hit with the village br br that being an interesting story in itself this smartly humorous film is laced with even more friendship romance crime death personal tragedy that makes this film so funny yet riddled with numerous subtle interests that make it so interestingly funny yet warm and fuzzy br br a must mention is the characters created and the actors making them believable you can have the best script yet if the characters aren't believable it can sink a film and with this the directing acting character believability and story all mesh so well they make this a very entertaining film br br so if your in the mood to stretch a lil want to see something very good yet done a bit differently then i suggest you rent this film while i'm on my way out to find more by director writer anders thomas jensen,1
2160,truly truly awful i don't even know where to begin this is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself i'm not sure i could even assign a category myself except that i'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone every where even the unborn br br at times i thought i was watching a parody or some kind of farce at times just a bad b movie but i kept holding out for the porno which i fear is almost but not entirely non existent br br some one advised skipping to the ending i would definitely second that emotion the last five minutes are intense and certainly contain some of the best film making cgi you will ever see ever br br ed wood would be proud,0
2161,this is a classic that will be able to hold up with drama's to come simply because of the fact that it is shot with a 70's style and it's a story about the 70's it is funny action filled entertaining and sad at the same time it has the effect to pull you into the lives of these poor folks and the consequences for their actions 4 stars,1
2162,before i really slag this film off i just want to say i absolutely loved it br br firstly how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase you're right i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again br br secondly what the hell is with those blue monkey things ok so the family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie creatures br br and finally 'old faithful here will protect me' hahaha,0
2163,i first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and i loved it i decided to get the dvd last year for my birthday it has the right amount of suspense action and drama this movie is about prep school called the regis school and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid william tepper sean astin has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at the regis school committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader luis andrew divoff father has been sent to prison and the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back br br along side william tepper is his rebellious friends at the regis school one in particular is joey trotta wil wheaton in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to the regis school because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so william joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics br br this movie was really awesome and i believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say die hard and even though i would have to agree with them they need to recognize that toy soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and i would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school but overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and if i had a decision to rent or buy it i would buy it i recommend it with a lot of hype 8 10,1
2164,the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video it features passable acting poor lighting a weak story and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public service announcement i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film,0
2165,the movie is being televised as i write br br i simply forgot how horrible an experience i had watching it in the cinema br br the whole idea of the movie is flawed the fact that intelligent europeans and americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable the madness of lord of the flies was longer in the making br br details that annoy are plenty one is the single african god like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply problems either ridiculous so too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide an indiana jones look alike whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut then there's the choice of lear imposed onto the group by a guru like joke of an artist he reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher br br the worst thing though is choice of lear obviously is an intellectual brain fart how that ever was going to be an pass time is never clear to me br br positives are few and far between it's a beautiful movie but that's never important br br high school intellectualism weird for the sake of weird it's a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies,0
2166,i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals i recently found the prey in its original vhs 'big box' form and was very excited i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic usually though it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic the prey is one of those films br br to be fair it started off ok with the killer stalking the cliché teenagers in the woods the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch this film is basically a big fat cliché and when the campfire stories section rolls in the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back story of the killer i actually thought this was quite an original idea however the back story ends abruptly and shows us some stock footage of a burning woodland the lack of budget really starts to show now after this we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods the killer himself isn't shown until the end which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer sort of like from the burning but better as for gore there isn't too much although there's an ok face squishing moment at the end br br overall i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists it really is a big mess,0
2167,this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot revolves around a man named luther who wears metal dentures bites people on the neck and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms he also thinks he's a chicken br br sounds bizarre right well to me the more bizarre and weird the person is the better the more gore the better and so on br br the movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution they mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck he also like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken br br if i had a patient like this there is no way i would release him br br first luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away then he sneaks in the back seat of a woman's car and she drives all the way to her home br br while at the house luther ties up the woman to the bed when the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home luther hides br br later through the film a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother you can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay she replies that everything is fine the officer finally gets in his car and leaves if i saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared i would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little br br the ending is stupid as well while the woman in in the barn she starts clucking and gets luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac she finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some more br br then the credits roll br br this is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen nothing happens at the woman's house nothing br br i sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 good idea bad direction,0
2168,this movie features some of the best ensemble work i've seen in film or on stage the actors play off each other with a skill and that in no way can be achieved through editing br br love jones a good story period but it is also an excellent portrayal of the urban middle income twenty something african american set that is not often seen,1
2169,i absolutely like this film a lot it is not very entertaining but it's a feast of bizarre and stunning images there's no dialog only some background sounds and noises if you are into something completely different and original and enjoy the obscure and bizarre then you might like this work of art looks like a film made with the very first camera ever made in a time where strange human like beings live and perform their bizarre habits god has killed himself with a razor and gave birth to mother earth mother earth impregnated herself with god's semen after an act of fellatio and gives birth to a son flesh on bone what follows are inhuman acts of ritualistic torture rape and murder for purposes we do not know or do we,1
2170,could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie sad is about all i can say this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head what an awful waste of two hours noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage,0
2171,this movie was so horrible i want to beat the hell out of who ever made this movie i was a original fan of all the ghoulies movies but when i seen this i just began to cry i could not handle it there are not even ne ghoulies in it like the original creative monsters this is so friggen cheap i come on a witch thats bull crap no one wants to see the witch they wanted to see what the movie is about ghoulies i am i right or what thats y we watched the other ones now we have to actually put up with this horrible storyline this makes me want to eat my own poop after spaghetti monday,0
2172,these are the kinds of movies i loved and still love growing up unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them this movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy br br there was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't a list material but that is not the point the point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge cgi cliché' filled movies there are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can br br besides its also nice to know that good ol' bruce isn't dead yet,1
2173,how awful is it let me count the ways 1 it is a bait and switch movie that starts out being about a ufo investigation then turns into a high pressure sales job for christianity c'mon if the makers of this movie felt so strongly about their message why disguise it it annoys non believers and pushes fence in the opposite direction 2 it's not even a good sales pitch if the characters in this flick asked me to go to church with them i'd run like hell in the opposite direction they're scary 3 the acting is terrible they all behave as if they were in an educational film about etiquette in the workplace 4 the cinematography is home movie bad wait actually its not even that good 5 script bad bad bad all dialogue no action like a tennis match they bounce back and forth between the talking head close ups 6 direction what direction oh there must have been a director there somewhere i challenge you to figure out where br br believe it or not i have some positive comments about this movie the editing seemed professional but couldn't make a difference a good edit of bad material is still a bad movie the opening theme music was actually very good very scary and ufo ish too bad the movie wasn't about ufos br br if you can't tell already here's the bottom line i wasted my money seeing this movie and it made me angry if they had not disguised what this movie was really about i could say it was my fault,0
2174,i am probably a little too old for this movie 16 and being a guy the story is a little too girlie but i really thought it was a cool movie overall all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses from alana to adrianne to to kimberly all the way down to the cute girl that plays little sister rachel i am not a huge pop star fan with the lovesick songs but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this and seems like he was really into this movie and made it seem real my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with so that's cool too i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool i rented this but i might buy it too since i have a ton of dvd's and like to go back to see something that i missed i couldn't buy it at blockbuster though so i don't know where i could buy it right now but i'll look into that anyway i am a 16 year old guy i already said that i know but i would totally take a date to see this it's really good for all ages really i think even my little half sister who is 6 could see this that's what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see i'm sure that was done on purpose but it really works girls can dream about being with aaron carter and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie there is something for everyone,1
2175,what about dj cash money this film fails in part by not covering the mid to late 80s there was only a small mention of dj cheese in 86 br br also it's not,1
2176,there have been some harsh criticisms of comanche moon on imdb i think this is for three reasons first purists are disappointed that the mini series is not exactly like the book second it's not as good as the original lonesome dove finally people like to complain on imdb and the greatest films in the world will have bad comments br br i would like to say that no movie is going to be as good as the book that's just the way it is lonesome dove wasn't as good as the novel it was based on additionally the movie of lonesome dove had some things left out ans switched around that's just they way its going to be with a film adaptation of anything so its a futile argument when looking at comanche moon br br i do agree it's not as good as the original dove but hey nothing is i know people that guide their lives by the lessons they learned from the dove if i was going to compare every book i read movie i watched and tv i viewed by lonesome dove i would be perpetually unhappy br br this is a made for tv miniseries based on a prequel to lonesome dave the novel and sequel to dead man's walk and that's what you get it's the best tv i've seen in years it's a fun set up for lonesome dove we get to learn about the history of the rangers we came to know and love in dove does an amazing job in recreating gus elizabeth banks and linda sp also do great jobs as creating characters that help fill in the past of the rangers and newt br br if when it comes on again i promise you'll enjoy it more than some crumby reality show,1
2177,i am so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever i'm shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless in this movie a former doctor who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash directs his steps to the nearest small town he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns which happens to be the purgatory flats and of course as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her but there is a tiny handicap she is already married to a very small time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself i'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties,1
2178,it is one of the best of stephen chow i give it a nine out of ten br br i was surprised to see that shaolin soccer was rated on top of all movies unbelievable,1
2179,this is not especially well written the songs are not memorable the cast however squeezes a lot out of this martin and lewis in the navy situation they both look great as young sailors they are believable the scenes on the submarine show how cramped it must have been on those underwater missions in the 1950s and before br br lots of sailors in many scenes hundreds perhaps in a big outdoor exercise field and again in a boxing arena br br you will see james dean in his scene he does stand out even though he is an extra here in a scene where jerry walks across a busy street we see some of his almost accident comedy which he would bring into play years later in the patsy br br dean giving jerry boxing instructions is a good comedy skit to watch for jerry in the boxing ring shows his high energy that was his trademark in the late '40s and early '50s dean and jerry dancing is a bit of a treat not great but better than most non dancing movies br br worth seeing if you don't mind black and white good ending br br tom willett,1
2180,honestly one of the worst written directed and acted movies i have ever seen seemed like a made for tv movie and a bad one at that i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie or that they are still allowing john sayles to make films my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it we ended up cleaning the house while it was on and it still bored us it made me think that critics have been so gullible with previous films such as lone star which was raved about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end spend your time on something better anything,0
2181,i've always loved horror flicks from some of the usual well known like the exorcist to some of the more underrated like black christmas or just before dawn but who are people kidding even calling this trash a b movie it's straight up bottom of the barrel z grade the acting is the worst ever on film really i've seen better on an episode of the young and the restless spoiler lookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of jack o she pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines a riot br br oh and besides the bad acting absolutely no gore or f x and jack o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin watch linnea quigley in night of the demons or silent night deadly night far superior flicks,0
2182,i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie it was unbelievable me and a group of friends decided to watch this one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us had ever seen i couldn't believe it we watched the first 15 minutes in utter awe that somebody actually thought of this and then made it into a movie are they on crack my guess is yes in huge doses i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash is this supposed to be sci fi or comedy or what i don't thing the idiots who made this even care they just decided to make a movie about nothing and see how many suckers they could trick into watching it well we put something on film so let's take it to the movie store and see if they actually put it on the shelf no no no this is not movie making the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is i feel like going to the movie store and complaining and getting my money back nobody should have to endure this crap so i am here to warn you do not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen,0
2183,the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing in which objects such as dvd and cd players are steadily in size it is obviously much cooler to have a smaller ipod than a larger one this is not so with theater screens as is the case with the imax the enormous widely known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release and to this day as long as the material's right br br the main problem with desolation walking on the moon 3d is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage it is dull uninformative and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin another problem with the film is that it doesn't even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon instead the writers have simply pressed copy and paste and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman bill paxton and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes this tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious br br i'd say without one moment's hesitation that i didn't learn one piece of information from the film that i didn't already know br br and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom hanks' voice to say something like without the contributions of these brave men and women watching the film is like watching a bad commercial for forty agonizing minutes br br 1 4,0
2184,week after week these women just sweep all the men of their feet get real none of these women are knockouts carrie sarah jessica parker looks like the type of woman men would pick up at 45am before the bar closed after their vision and standards were equally impaired by ten or eleven martinis yet she's the queen bee a super sexy man killer the other three don't fare much better and their constant foul mouthed comments not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never catch a disease this show is pathetic and creepy i don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women even if he popped viagra like tic while on shore leave,0
2185,captain mandolin is no oscar contender but it was pretty good i have to admit ms cruz can really act she puts on a very good performance in fact she our does her boyfriend tom in drama john hurt was great as usual nicholas cage seemed to be enjoying himself i bet he felt he was going back to his roots as an italian however i did learn something one more chapter in horrors of nazi germany the many italian killed during the period of there surrender to the allies and germany's eventual surrender,1
2186,ocean's twelve is probably better than ocean's eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from benedict andy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around ocean's twelve is more entertaining and cooler than ocean's eleven with a funny cameo by topher grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think ocean's twelve is probably the best in the series br br the plot a year or so after ocean's twelve terry benedict the guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if ocean's eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole he's going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets him again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are br br with many funny scenes like when tess julia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts ocean's twelve is a pretty clever film it's cooler funnier and more entertaining than ocean's eleven,1
2187,my first thoughts on this film were of using science fiction as a bad way to show naked women not a brilliant story line it had quite a good ending,0
2188,i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining good characters good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller if you liked this film i would recommend the spanish prisoner the house of games and no way out,1
2189,musical bios are all cut of the same cloth hopeful struggles succeeds and finally wins the girl but this one a life of irish tenor chauncey jack chancellor has more going for it than the usual trappings it has great charm and great sincerity and is played beautifully by all concerned dennis morgan is fine in the lead as is arlene dahl as his love interest andrea king's supporting performance as lillian russell is far better than alice faye's leading bio performance in the film dedicated to her career william frawley is touching as the aging tenor champion william scanlon and sara is lovely as mother george tobias ben blue and alan hale lend good support there are over 25 songs a true treasure chest come down my evening star my blue eyes you tell me your dream wait till the sun shines nellie will you love me in december by the light of the moon minstrel days polly doodle the and the robert e lee miss lindy lou if i'm dreaming wee rose of shake hands one little girl a little bit of heaven mary sweet um when irish eyes are smiling mother the fair room in my heart my wild irish rose br br although the film only earned one oscar nom for scoring and deservedly it also deserved nods for art direction and costume design sumptuous and lovely in technicolor br br reasons why this is not on video may be due to the large chunk of time spent within the minstrel show atmosphere at least a quarter of the film with a great deal of material quite politically incorrect for today's audiences it's historically accurate however br br this is a true gem and very worth seeking out it leaves one with a warm glow,1
2190,were it not for the fact that this came as a 2 dvd set paired with the original american graffiti were it not for the fact that i've been here in iraq for several months and at this point will watch pretty much anything i would have tossed this movie in the garbage after the first ten minutes this movie was appallingly bad on so many levels i just don't know where to start poorly acted shot directed written scored edited my 9 year old daughter's first forays into film making are superior to this and she was filming the dog sleeping come to think of it i give that piece of cinematography 9 stars but i'm biased if you have even the slightest appreciation for quality film making then avoid this piece of garbage at all costs no character in this movie has a single redeeming quality save for the icelandic girl who doesn't even have a single line in english i'll not waste more of my time describing what a bad movie this is,0
2191,okay when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b movie space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people br br well it was almost everything what i expected typical low budget scifi movie from the 60's acting has to be the worst i've ever seen especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off br br so why 'night doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good' reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose and then the grand finale the people's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get in 20 second end of film br br yeah 'night is boring but it got couple of funny moments i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like the thing from venus' or of the swamp br br i give 'night 4 space monkey slaps out of 10 br br rob gruesome,0
2192,before this was shown on mtv or vh1 it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day it was the first time i had ever a music movie like this but i will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a 35mm print in a darken theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a cropped pan and scan version on vh1 at halloween,1
2193,these immortal lines begin the jack directed masterpiece 'the dion brothers' the plot centers around two blue collar west brothers stacy keach and frederic forrest who commit robberies in hopes of using the money to open a seafood restaurant what follows is quite an adventure and many comedic events ensue the action scenes are all top notch and consist of some nicely realized shootouts the latter of which is absolutely amazing and occurs in an abandoned building being demolished by a wrecking ball the film was written by now famous director terrence malick and features an early appearance by margot kidder all in all an excellent hidden gem of the 70s and easily one of the finest action comedy hybrids every made hopefully it gets a decent widescreen dvd release soon,1
2194,as a big jim carey fan i took my seat in the cinema with optimism after all fun with dick and jane appeared to have all the raw materials to make this another carey success after the opening five minutes of good humour it seemed that this film would provide but it went wrong as soon as the plot kicked in the idea that a charming charismatic top v i p employee could suddenly find himself turning up to work in his nearest supermarket is just so hard to believe and then to get your head round the fact that this guy has also become a master criminal is virtually impossible the actors seem confused with the situation as well of course the stereotypical rich uncaring head of the operation doesn't struggle one bit to pull off his one dimensional character but for carey and others around him the job is a whole lot harder one minute dick is seen as a cocky office pro obsessed with possessions the next minute he's a bumbling mess who can barely string two words together and ultimately he becomes a petty thief who is able quite happily to put a gun to another man's head jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really gets going br br the idea behind the story is such a good one and it is a shame that this film has not managed to make it work the odd moment of laugh out loud comedy can be found but it is usually more physical humour than anything witty or clever carey tries his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent can never flourish in a character that has so many gaping holes to his personality carey shines when he is presented with a strong daring character man on the moon the truman show ace ventura which this film never presented him with despite its best efforts,0
2195,it has very little to do with the books half of the characters have been eliminated the plot has been greatly altered people's parents are changed for different characters br br however if you watch it as an independent piece try and forget you ever read the books the movie is very well put together everyone is very good looking and there is even a sweet ending,1
2196,paranoid park is about alex a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his parent's divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jennifer played by taylor momsen who you can currently see in gossip girl while he's consumed by guilt i had seen just one movie by gus van sant so far elephant and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one once again he crosses time lines once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never ending shots of people walking maybe you like these filming techniques i know i don't the plot feels unsatisfactory to me its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time the feeling i get same with elephant is that gus van sant tries too hard to make an artistic movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance also gabe was pretty bad as alex there's a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot if you're a fan of mr van sant then watch this otherwise skip it br br 3 10,0
2197,everywhere i hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched well maybe a do good cab driver in philly is pushing it a little at least the cab drivers ive met but that's what makes the show great br br the fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun its highly watchable and even though u know mike wins out in the end he never wins in life david morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role his supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great br br all in all i watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action i watch this show because its got great acting a good premise and a great story line every week it's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by or know what intersection he's at i love this show and i love philly give this show a shot,1
2198,matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the footloose and available nurses on the staff whilst colleague and friend richard benjamin looks on with amusement and amazement their boss is hard of hearing going on senile chief of staff art carney who is up for re election to that post br br matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother glenda jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life at the same time he comes under pressure to respond to the amorous advances of a potential in a malpractice suit and to support the shambolic and incompetent carney in his attempt to be re elected chief of staff br br this is a superior old fashioned romantic comedy graced by four grade a actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first rate dry caustic and sarcastic script carney steals every scene he's in and in the parlance of imdb has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen we are otherwise entertained by the on off relationship of the two leads and various sub plots br br lacks the ambition to be a great film but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re watchable for its comedic value alone deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the dvd or video cassette,1
2199,i was a child when i saw this serial a bit after seen buck rogers one both characters performed by the same buster crabbe and i must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment i've ever had the fight against emperor ming was one thing but i was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of flash with dale and aura came and persuaded aura to forget flash very innocent termination of her obsession for good looking flash the serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences another thing is that i learned floating in water looking the way crabbe did it when fighting against shark men the soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of boris karloff's frankenstein it would be nice to have the dvd of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in spanish not yet available,1
2200,this movie is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it when susie q is of to her big night at prom she dies in a fatal car crash on her way to prom by kids who are drunk and high as the years go by house gets sold and a family moves into the house that she loves as the boy who now lives in the house sees susie and is the only one who can the two team together with his little little sister and try to save parents from being broke staring amy jo johnson as susie q this movie will fell your heart with comedy sadness and laughter i hope that you see this movie because it is very good but no one seems to have it on dvd or and it no longer comes on tv,1
2201,let's not beat about the bush here taylor undoubtedly slick movie has little to make it stand out from the biopic genre other than jamie foxx's exceptional career making performance remember the year they handed the special effects oscar to the terminator 2 uncontested they should do the same with this year's best actor gong br br that ray charles' story is worthy of filming is not in dispute indeed the many flashbacks to his traumatic childhood are well handled and used but for a life so unique the film seems incredibly formulaic and familiar it follows the of a flawed genius' template almost to the letter hardship and exploitation women and drugs recording wrangles band squabbles rehab yeah yeah yeah and surely there was more humour in his life than we're treated to here br br i appreciate charles' music yet where neatly cut would have kept the story rolling indulges himself with near full length renditions of too many songs in gin joints in the recording studio in concert halls infinitum narratively and for non devotees they begin to act like a cinematic brake this may seem like harsh judgement on a music biopic but with a catalogue as extensive as ray's we need a taste not the whole dish otherwise we'd buy the albums br br intrigued as i was i glanced at my watch more than once so for all foxx's brilliance maybe ray would have been better served as an hbo two parter,1
2202,why do people make bad movies didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point there is something about this picture that threw me off besides the fact that i found this movie to be unrealistic pathetic and poorly acted i admire them for the try but the actors in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent this movie deserves zero stars but i did not have that option so it gets a 1,0
2203,i own this movie i am actually from the same town as the brother directors but that doesn't make the film any better but if one night you wanna watch something not serious and don't have and high expectations i strongly recommend demon summer yes the lines are cheesy and the plot is corny but it contains key elements of a horror comedy i just wanna see some small town kids make a movie full of effects and i say bravo to the campell brothers they are now making more movies and continuing a long dream demon summer was one of the movies that are gonna help them start a great career with a great future speed freak productions and compound pictures described in one word potential,1
2204,apart from the fact that this film was made i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular the one thing that puzzled me about guest house paradiso was what happened to the lighting there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever and i watched it on network tv so it wasn t a case of watching a dodgy tape in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on but if the dialogue was anything to go by that s maybe not a bad thing,0
2205,the person making taffy in this movie was so realistic that person must have been trained so well if i were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy i would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy,0
2206,beautiful that one word pretty much sums up this whole film everything from the cinematography the directing the acting brilliant at any point of the film you can pause it and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say i assure you that after one viewing will be stuck in your head i know this from first hand experience even the soundtrack is great it goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film be thankful that cam archer exists in this world we need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real and surreal imagery,1
2207,i hope the people who made this movies read these comments the choreography was horrid the plot was and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk br br the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move camera cut aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects the lightning was just plain stupid the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen br br next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts br br honestly there are shows on t v that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one br br stick to martial arts unless its as poor as your acting then take up,0
2208,oh god it could be a very interesting film and in fact it is i would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote why i saw it in a theatre see this film on dvd or on tv the shooting is really really poor it keeps shaking all the time in a completely tasteless framing br br its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema you got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat br br it's really a shame 'cos the story is edited in a non linear way which is quite rare and a very good idea for a documentary br br watch this at home,0
2209,blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo blackwater valley exorcism is not not by a long shot it's certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for sci fi channel production it's one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater 3000 or a similar show br br the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was horrendously bad there was not a single performance that didn't lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling oh except maybe for jeffery re animator combs as the sheriff the script wasn't that terrible but it certainly wasn't anything special br br it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room c'mon and if your daughter is possessed don't worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat rabbits try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget d list demon br br there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a list demons like crucifix intercourse painful body distortions or even projectile vomiting br br totally laughable movie not worth even a discount rental br br 2 out of 10,0
2210,it plays like your usual teenage audience t a movie but the sentiment is incredibly bleak if it was made today it'd be considered an art house movie it goes through the usual routine of a guy trying to get laid but the results of his efforts are harsh and cruel and unsatisfying br br the whole teen flick formula is adhered to but nothing turns out the way you'd expect imagine a director's cut of 'it's a wonderful life' where at the end james stewart wasn't allowed to return to the real world an incredible film that subverts all of the expectations of the genre it makes you feel dirty afterwards there is no redemption for the characters i'm amazed it ever got made the eighties version of detective story,1
2211,imdb forces reviewers to type a certain amount of lines but all i really want to say is this is an incredible film and you can't consider yourself a film fan without having seen it you ought to just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and push play but i have to type something so let me point out the following br br 1 river's edge contains what still may well rank as crispin glover's all time funniest and best performance in a film and if you have been following crispin glover at all you know that that alone justifies giving it a 10 funny lines galore br br 2 river's edge contains the second most memorable performance of dennis hopper's career other than the one in blue velvet and it is really excellent dennis hopper is really funny br br 3 river's edge contains the best performance of keanu reeves' career and it is excellent it was the role he was born to play he has plenty of good lines but one in particular is really really funny listen close when his character and the step dad are talking to one another br br still the best stoner film it is much more than just that it tends to show up in the drama sections of film rental stores but if this is a drama it's the funniest drama of all time,1
2212,you may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to the stepford but this is an absolute classic much scarier in premise than the first and very entertaining it only got a video release here in the uk but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy,1
2213,this film is absolute gold if you haven't seen it do mani outdoes himself once again this film introduced me to nandita das as well though everyone shines in this movie my only regret is i've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs we are led from the jungle of northern sri lanka to the serene beaches of southern india as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart beautiful subtle witty with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer this movie stands up to being seen again and again and the story within the story the umbrella is done so well as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book lovely watch it,1
2214,by the acting in this movie it is sometimes hard not to imagine that the cast are who they portray themselves to be unbridled passion and acting at times make this a very enjoyable and engaging movie wouldn't even have known about it except for hbo late night and the biggest reason i like uk films much better than american ones are that the actors aren't afraid to act out what is needed,1
2215,i'm pretty sure poe would have considered this a travesty the first two stories are decent nothing spectacular and then there's toby dammit what on earth was fellini thinking it's a rambling random dull piece with little to recommend it one should feel frustrated at the lack of backstory or conclusion but there's only relief that it's over,0
2216,son of the mask is a terrible movie i don't like the baby and i don't like the dog jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage even at only 88 minutes or so it says the movie could not end soon enough for me the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben stain that's it the rest is just a rehash of the first movie actually that is just an insult to rehashes why was this sequel made this movie cost millions of dollars to make why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie i am not bothering to be nice to this movie 1 10,0
2217,terry and june in my mind is a all time classic along the ranks with bless this house with the late sid james and the late diana but terry scott will be sadly missed even tho he passed away in 1994 i have all the dvds upto press and i look forward to getting all 9 also would be nice to see happy after ever released on dvd br br june whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live on in my memory br br terry scott r i p there aren't many comedies today that i can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class bit does get on some peoples wicks but i don't mind i think it would be brilliant to see some celebration of the life of terry scott,1
2218,caught this movie on dd while flipping channels and thank heavens that too when it just started having studied in this film touched off many happy memories of the city that apart one wonders why more movies like this aren't made every character is so well etched the grandpa the kid the doc except for the social worker who grates a tad the rest of the movie hardly has a flaw a deserving entry for the oscars even if it wasn't nominated definitely leaves a lump in the throat who u need mush to tickle ur and to think that this movie needed sachin tendulkar to propagate it inspite of being in marathi there was hardly a moment where i wasn't able to follow the movie the subtitles were good a must watch for any fan of good cinema,1
2219,along with virtually every republic picture ever made murder in the music hall seems to have faded into oblivion a shame because this lusciously produced expertly directed and written and crafty mystery suspense item spins an enticing whodunnit thriller against the setting of radio city music hall a murder in one of the building's posh penthouse apartments casts suspicion on the luscious among them vera ralston who besides giving an appealing performance of subtlety and provides a few dazzling ice skating production numbers helen walker ann rutherford julie bishop and several other delectable b movie starlets of the '40s tall blond and handsome william marshall usually cast in musicals hunts down the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds against the swankiest settings you'll ever see in a film noir the ending is as much of a surprise as is this sadly forgotten classy murder mystery well worth restoring and reviving on cable tv vhs or dvd republic sank a hefty budget in this grade a production and murder in the music hall is as slick unnerving and immensely enjoyable as any of the major studios' films of its era possible spoiler pay attention to the song composed by the victim just before his death then amidst the incessant chattering in their dressing rooms try to pinpoint the one humming that fatal melody you'll discover who the killer is just as william marshall does grand fun the kind of movie they truly don't make anymore and what a loss both to movie goers and actors alike,1
2220,obviously made on the cheap to capitalize on the notorious mandingo this crassly pandering hunk of blithely rancid italian sexploitation junk really pours on the sordid stuff with a commendable lack of taste and restraint the evil arrogant white family who own and operate a lavish slave plantation spend a majority of the screen time engaging in hanky panky both each other and their various slaves director mario and screenwriter cram this fetid filth with a teeming surplus of sizzling sleaze we've got nasty rape interracial copulation one white lady makes wild love to a muscular black stud while he's tied to a cross copious female nudity brutal vile degradation lots of lurid soft core sex and a severely twisted tragic surprise ending that mixes elements of incest murder and miscegenation in a questionable attempt at making a statement about the horrid inhumanity of slavery special kudos are in order for foxy brunette actress paola whose lusty and uninhibited portrayal of depraved and lascivious wicked bitch rhonda positively burns up the screen moreover marcello giombini's funky throbbing tribal score hits the groovy spot fairly polished cinematography likewise does the trick a satisfyingly seamy chunk of slimy swill,1
2221,is there a fire fighter cliché that is not used in this film from the opening line i'm getting too old for this through the antics of the firemen to the worrisome wife the loss of his best friend in the firehouse to the final funeral for the fallen brethren this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney our studies show that audiences really like it when and then they stuck it in br br there is nothing original here any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for firemen br br go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers,0
2222,the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done the problem with this compilation is a minor one yet annoying the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the 24 frame p s speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p s this results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time it's just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed there are separate restored versions of these classics available even on dvd and it would not be a problem to restore the image but alas this has not been done br br a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating the shorts are still worth '10',1
2223,being 15 myself i enjoyed this flick thouroughly i related to the character ann august more than most would my mother isnt as eccentric as adele but the feelings of lonliness is the same this movie is perfect in the aspects and natalie's and susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years their chemistry brings the characters to life they become real people i would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away because there is alot of people out there who would wish to be anywhere but here including me and if you can see this movie with your best friend or your mother its the tears that blend everyone around you together more,1
2224,bigfoot movies tend to be bad so i'm not inclined to watch them however there were some good commercials on the sci fi channel so i decided to watch a climbing expedition heads into the pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expedition's leader played by lance and have brought a revolutionary dna detector that could be used to prove the existence and it actually generates some suspense at first the sasquatch is unseen but sees the mountain body heat like the alien in predator and i did wonder when it was going to strike the acting is passable as is the background music the dense wooded location is well used and when the creature is finally seen the costume is not bad though nothing great but as the film grinds on it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd most of the characters are unpleasant people rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity except for lance character so that it's impossible to care about what happens to them and their behavior become increasingly stupid one man shoots the creature not fatally then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark one female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch without getting her hair and make up messed up then the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the dna detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind a creature knows what threatens it obviously the instinct doesn't apply to these actors or they wouldn't have appeared in this movie and the ending is so stupid you'll want to kick the tv screen if it weren't for the script it would have been a decent horror film,0
2225,adam sandler's movies are my favorite comedies the silence of the lambs is my favorite horror movie the matrix is my favorite sci fi movie anywhere but here is my favorite drama br br perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting br br susan sarandon is absolutely amazing by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself she did a simply amazing job br br natalie portman also did a great job i recently rented her first movie leon 1994 in which she played a 12 year old girl i believe that she is a contradiction in terms she was a good kid actress well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress in fact she's much better br br not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together i mean even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie br br this movie is about a 14 year old girl portman and her restless mother sarandon that leave their home town in wisconsin for beverly hills br br at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years usually down might i add br br although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be summarized vaguely but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep what i am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly but then they focus in on it to make it strong br br and it is very strong but also the plot sequencing is great and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as classic br br i loved this movie i laughed i cried and although admittedly there are a few loopholes it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end,1
2226,up and coming was a very positive sitcom which brought a tool and or channel that opened the young minds of the black culture the focus and outlook was a message of positivity for our people and hope for change i advise this selection for every american household to experience the struggle and the reward the show was never given the chance to blossom into the idea of middle class blacks becoming business owners of their own the were so compatible with real life that impacted the lives of so many i sincerely hope that the entire volume can be restored and put on dvd for americans to enjoy with their families br br thanks,1
2227,don wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game okay actually they make the models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is don wilson who in the mean time falls in love with the model actually with all things considered my biggest confusion was trying to understand if the people brought over from virtual reality land were robots human cyborgs or just some type of unidentified computer program it doesn't matter since this is all just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors ever butcher dialog as if he were running a deli don wilson's complete lack of charisma is the film's biggest flaw since one just doesn't like the guy he's too goody goody his voice is too high pitched and doesn't look very impressive in the action sequences what saves this bore fest from my lowest rating is massey who looks super hot in high cut outfits and who gets occasionally naked also on board is loren a good martial artist stella stevens and michael dorn as the main voice of the bad guy but their efforts are in vain as they are all concealed by the very bad acting of wilson another flaw which is the film's biggest mistake is a lack of action as we are asked to watch the story unfold but aside from massey's nudity and maybe some unintentional amusements due to laughably unconvincing acting there really is nothing of interest this also extends to the action sequences in which are flatly choreographed badly directed and completely drained of all possible excitement making this virtually unwatchable br br out of 4 bad,0
2228,these were two video shot movies that decided were horrible so in a desperate move turned into this one movie perhaps the bitterness on side helped spark the comedy but for whatever reason this is very funny stuff with an inspired bit with oliver stone doing commentary during the movie lots of cameos lots of use of the lesbian cannibal song add to the fun trey parker ted raimi julie strain etc etc br br one of the best of recent releases yes it's all over the place know that going in the production quality or lack of becomes one of the many running jokes go with it and you'll be in for a good time br br the behind the scenes frequently the best things about releases are also above average this time around i really think the anger they felt over these two lousy films helped drive them to well not greatness but drove them to fix this film in a way that's better than either of the films would have been as they were originally planned,1
2229,i wish hollywood would make more movies like the china syndrome because this one scores on every level br br it has an intelligent believable script it shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger and the movie also gives you a great behind the scenes look of how television is made br br it scores as a thriller the first time i saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat and it scores as a character movie i really cared for the main characters jane fonda michael douglas wilford brimley and most of all jack lemmon are great,1
2230,pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters it seems to herald a more serious more meaningful film but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly there isn't a great deal to say people talk take drugs have visions they talks some more its not bad so much as pointless and dull the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this,0
2231,1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like don't go into the woods alone and this one but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as don't go into the woods but it's still not great either one thing is that it's just boring and acting isn't very good but much better than and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space br br so what was there to like about this movie well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments i couldn't contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon walk to get away from the and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney looking br br all in all the prey is dumb boring and the killer i didn't find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better,0
2232,seeing the names of the starring actors statham snipes and phillippe i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen and hearing tons of lame and shabby bad cop phrases br br the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with and when you have that than no one can help you not statham not wesley snipes not even john mcclane could save this movie it could be cool for the kids if they aren't over 12 years of age because they don't care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie,0
2233,a brilliant professor and his sidekick journey to the center of the earth in a huge machine which screws its way to the core there naturally they find all kinds of things that are intent on killing and eating them plus of course a love interest for the young sidekick ho hum does the plot never take a different tack,0
2234,hi being able to speak cantonese i found this very funny and was able to all the jokes that one might not get due to language barriers the fight scenes are spectacular and it's a good movie however i have my criticisms first of all i find that it is not as good as the first one project a go and see that now reason is spoilers ahead don't read on if you haven't seen the film because in project a jackie ends by fighting his enemy the man he is sent to kill that is what he has been striving to do all the film and the showdown is spectacular but in a ii hough he fights chan the showdown scene between jackie and his nemesis is not long enough and the bulk of the action is against the men they are not nearly as bad enough and have only played a minor part in the film in relation to jackie so though their fight sequence is spectacular they are not the ones jackie is hunting throughout the whole of the film so thus leaving the viewer slightly unfulfilled however this is just my humble opinion so don't take it word for word go and see it yourself it is a great film in it's own right take care and hope your admiration for jackie grows yours sincerely ian ps you know the police chief in a ii he's the same guy in first strike nice to know he's still going strong,1
2235,star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series despite the good acting efforts by the actors it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset br br the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a for saving the earth from total ecological disaster their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii the planet of intergalactic peace captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by spock's half brother the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with god just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the pursuers br br the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing william shatner leonard nimoy deforest kelley laurence and the rest of the cast all give good performances william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film br br however the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding first the part of was initially offered to sean connery but he refused so laurence got the part second many of the special effects were severely cut back reducing the movies entertaining potential third the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired finally the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v br br overall this is a very weak film you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi after all the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v,0
2236,watched the director's cut last night glad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir the anachronisms modern telephones were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else the non traditional casting i also found distracting if i have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick drag queen doing there then the storyteller has failed me again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final project ish and for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color there was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no texture just black and just white boring,0
2237,the ghost walks is a nifty little mystery with a great twist snappy dialog and best of all a pansy played to the hilt by character actor johnny arthur which never demeans or denigrates his character mr arthur is great in his role of homer bringing great comic relief as the secretary of the broadway producer herman wood played by another great character actor richard carle br br they play off of each other superbly br br although the acceptable words of the time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of homer it is never mean spirited or meant as denigration and are not spoken by the manly males of the film but by his employer who fires and him every other scene and who displays an almost exasperated affection for his devoted employee br br there is a great scene where homer tells his boss that he has devoted the best years of his life to him and has been everything but a mother to him br br the mystery angle of the film is very entertaining and the twist at the end might just leave you in stitches br br for a low budget poverty row picture this film has superb set decoration and great costuming br br director frank strayer ably handles his cast and this film holds together much better than some of his other low budget mystery attempts but he had a great script to work with and some wonderful actors to carry it through br br this film is a must see for devotees of poverty row films old dark house mysteries they actually managed to work in the lines it was a dark and stormy night and it has the added bonus of being an early representation of a gay character in film where nothing bad happens to them in the end br br this movie is available for download in the public domain film section of the internet archive at archive org,1
2238,i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film from director lionel jefferies who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang basically it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in victorian london one night the father is visited by two strangers and he leaves with them and does not return they move to a cottage in the country and here the children bobbie jenny agutter who i first saw in child's play 2 phyllis sally thomsett and peter gary warren keep their spirits up with their fascination for the nearby railroad everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes their kindness makes them friends including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father also starring dinah sheridan as mother mrs waterbury bernard cribbins as albert perks william mervyn as old gentleman peter as doctor forrest ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian it was number 29 on the 100 greatest family films and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films very good,1
2239,i have just seen the movie 15 park avenue which was the first night presentation movie in the asia society human rights film festival in new york i was really moved by the subject matter of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of by the lead actor konkona sen sharma i have just one word for everyone who is reading this comment run to get a copy of this gem and watch it my sincere thanks to director sen who has done a excellent job again movie like this comes on once in a blue moon and i was lucky enough to see this movie on screen and also took part in a after movie discussion question and answer session with konkona sen sharma in a simple word a wonderful experience,1
2240,spoilers cash crop goes something like this down on their luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet dea agent blows into town farmers hide the pot dea agent leaves town end of story br br this flick features solid performances by some second tier actors mediocre direction and a so so screenplay but it ain't got no story and since the story is the foundation of every drama cash crop is an utter failure too boring to recommend,0
2241,filmmaker bryan forbes who once displayed a light sardonic touch with beguiling material such as whistle down the wind and the original stepford wives completely bottoms out here not only is his direction inept he also sloppily adapted sidney early novel the results are atrocious roger moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients rod steiger chewing the scenery is a hot under the collar cop it's easily his most embarrassing performance the only actor here to exhibit some life is elliott gould who knows a thing or two about enlivening a bum script bland choppy and produced on the cheap no stars from,0
2242,joseph conrad's novel heart of darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed after i finished reading heat of darkness i watched the movie which was a mistake the movie cut out so many substantial parts for example in the novel marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat this was a big source of futility in the movie that part was just left out the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense for example when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him what purpose did that scene have other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey it's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the razzie awards,0
2243,it's fun to watch a young james cagney doing his thing he plays the weights and measures guy who takes his job very seriously stepping on the toes of a group of crooked politicians he is offered the world but keeps his integrity he is beaten and set up but that's the problem we never know if he is really in danger they say he's in a spot but still seems to have carte blanche to move around and do what he needs to do at times he's so cocky he doesn't do much to protect himself his allies are in the police department but just about everything else is pretty corrupt he perseveres almost too good to be true of course and we pull for him the problem for me is a lack of sustained suspense it would have been much better if he had had to clear his name he never drops into the depths even when rejected by his wife to be it's still fun with the bad guys kind of see it just to watch cagney do his tough guy posturing,1
2244,being a great fan of disney i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage the animation was pretty and the backgrounds were amazing but i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak script and weak story i'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to but i digress the script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies the music was soppy the morals forced and forced without any charm whatsoever and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times the characters were also cold and i really couldn't muster up any form of emotion towards them bar irritation i am a great fan of jungle book aladdin and new groove but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of time do not watch it,0
2245,the first half of this movie was quite good it was interesting and suspenseful the second half was pretty bad the comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic nazi characters and some badly acted good guys blowing them away there's a lot of violence in this movie i'm not squeamish about violence but i think it should at least have some purpose in a movie there was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles we're somehow supposed to be amused by this br br i watched reservoir dogs recently there was a movie where violence was employed effectively it was realistic within the world the movie created there were never any over the top sound effect it was a crime movie which played it straight inglorious basterds should have played it straight but didn't i was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face br br none of the back story of any of the basterds is really explained either they're simply nazi hunters we don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face it's all about revenge and very little else br br there was 2 1 2 hours to work with here but few of the basterds were really examined in depth this seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple we saw that in tarantino's last flick death proof which i didn't care for either it suffered the same problems the characters were almost interchangeable br br the first half again was pretty good i wanted to see the exploits of the inglorious basterds across europe i was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in france,0

2247,i viewed this movie at the magnolia theater in dallas a couple of days ago punk everyone and everything involved in the movie added to the of it the music well of course but the movie itself captured the whole punk genre even a grandmother and school teacher me can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality well reality film wise this movie takes a handful of ticked off young film makers and clearly and cleverly shows the why of their angst over not being given the green light on finishing the waldo film the relatively happy girl gave good comic relief a nice respite from the continual but understandable ragging on the dude who left them in a lurch gotta love stu though and be sure to watch read the credits they're the icing on the cake,1
2248,ok by the time you read this i might have stopped crying this movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing the creatures are kinda cute but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island even seeing barbara bach with her hair all was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop she goes about with a whispery i've never used my voice before that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder hey the leading man was cute too but i'm still not assuaged this is a cry into your beer ripoff of the good ole island of dr moreau poor richard johnson who was surely born for better things is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy i mean how bad can a bad guy be ask richard johnson joseph cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance in the name of all that's holy don't rent this darned bomb,0
2249,i've sat through less painful operations than the time i spent watching this film br br if you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a guy ritchie flick think again the production dialogue acting script film work and plot were about the worst i've ever seen in a film my fave part in all honesty was the closing credits in all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for turning off the tv and going out and doing something better with your life br br have root canal work done rather than wasting your time and money on this,0
2250,this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life so for example when he's eight it's the eight year old's voice that is doing the narration when he's in junior high it's that one doing the narration etc that's about the only interesting thing about this movie it looks like each actor playing is a separate character not only do they not look alike their life experiences don't seem to match up br br avoid this movie like a bad cold,0
2251,steve smith has finally run a fairly weak series right into the ground with this movie poor actors thrashing a horrible script pretty much sums this one up two hours of your life you'll never get back go get a root canal instead you'll enjoy it more,0
2252,walking with dinosaurs is absolutely brilliant in every regard kenneth branagh narrates in a way that really makes you want to listen the script for the documentary really sounds as though the researchers and writers had done their homework it is so insightful and it does get you hooked and never lets go the music is also brilliant very dramatic when it needs to be but the visual effects and scenery are what makes this documentary work so well the scenery is breathtaking and the dinosaurs look so real thanks to the simply astounding effects this is so informative with such a good concept and attracts not only adults but kids too br br in conclusion this is a must watch not only did i love this but this is quite possibly the best documentary i have ever seen if anything it could have done with being longer other than that this is perfect 10 10 bethany cox,1
2253,1 let's suspend belief for a moment and let's stop pretending we could might or ought know how it is or ought to be there in space human knowledge in that area is probably primitive as say middle ages maps are compared to today's satellite maps so we really have no clue 2 considering this is just a bbc tv docu simulation it gets much better than many big budget hollywood blockbusters and that is just incredible 3 all in all a show worth watching as it portrays the cgi enhanced and fictionalized account of what we know of the solar system this far 4 probably fictionalizing and cgi ing the whole thing is the only way to make it palatable to a large public ever watched clips from real space missions and real space probes the quality is generally average to poor and the comparison would be between looking at a chest x ray and what it tells about the human body and compare it with a cgi ed cyborg movie which one would be most entertaining yet the chest x ray is real while the cyborg flick is just fictionalized sfx 5 actors do a good job none i'll tell my grandchildren about but very fair for it being a bbc docu simulation,1
2254,i don't see why everyone loves this film so much true it does have good intentions and meaning but you cannot compensate for such a poor script woody allen is a brilliant filmaker but i'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage it's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible i happen to be a huge woody allan fan and love most of his work but this i cannot recomend,0
2255,i watched this cooking show for a few times before i wanted to pull my hair out just one question who can't cook a slapped together plain meal in 30 minutes when everything you need is at hand already bagged sometimes pre chopped and you have very little else to do except chop a few greens also almost every cooking show on tv is 30 minutes and most of these chefs do all of their prep work except for sandra lee during their show oh and yep they do full meals too br br love the comment by the guy who hated the comment add de to my list of stupid tag words br br then you have the obvious a loud gregarious woman who is truly her own best audience she laughs at her own lame comments mugs too many times for the camera because she wants to convince us that she's as good as the thinks br br no she ain't the cutest thing she's a 40 something year old woman who isn't de,0
2256,bette midler is the best thing about this movie it is a poor second to the original from 1962 with natalie wood as gypsy the songs were done much better in the original and the costumes were better bette's voice was great and she looked better in most of the costumes compared to cynthia only someone who has not seen the original would think this a good movie br br there was not enough of a change between ugly duckling to beautiful girl when natalie wood was gypsy she only was seen as beautiful when she got into the dress with her gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show when she has her hair down and then magically it is all done up beautifully and she looks so elegant it is an important aspect to the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees herself as something special and that she might actually be a star not just a poor substitute to her sister and the scenes where she slowly becomes more famous were rushed through it was an important part of the movie and they butchered it it is critical to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original it was a huge let down to watch it unfold in this movie i was completely disappointed and had it not been for bette midler i would have shut the movie off,0
2257,mmmm a previous summary says if you like aliens and predator you will enjoy this film i could not disagree more this film pays no respect to its weighty lineage and has reduced two of the best loved sci fi strands to little more than a teen horror slasher movie it has none of the tension or foreboding present in previous alien or predator movies and there is no discernible lead character i really did not care about any of the characters and i positively yearned to see the stereotypical cast die as soon as possible in the vain hope something better would replace them it really takes super human incompetence to have two of the most fearsome creatures ever invented positively fail to make a gripping thrilling movie only watch this if you want to see how not to do it,0
2258,if you're looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosterone pumped carnage craving war buffs out there don't bother although the film is about russian characters in wwii don't expect to see any nazis cannons blood gore etc it's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war it's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it br br acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here you'll certainly appreciate it if you're russian like me but even if not you'll probably love it if you speak no russian look for the ruscico russian cinema council dvd version it's got subtitles in about 14 different languages but the english dubbing on this one i'd say is just as good it's of course not as good as the original russian track some stuff is lost in translation but just as good as the english subtitles so go check it out especially if you're studying film in any aspect,1
2259,this film would have put the typical hollywood tearjerkers to shame the emotions portrayed are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion the plot is cliche enough with a lead role having terminal disease this is not a spoiler and was well established quite early into the movie the method of execution is somehow unique from most love stories you ever saw not even a kiss was being exchanged and yet you will feel the enormous current of love between the two leads initially i assumed this restriction on emotions to be something to the typical eastern values but later decided against it br br this film is so understated that if you compare it with movies like cinema paradiso cp would have felt overtly manipulative by comparison so it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea br br after watching the film i have this strong feeling that holly wood love movies or love movies all around to be accurate have been glorifying romance or passion and label it as love i am sure we all have our own definitions and i wouldn't say these qualities are mutually exclusive but i would venture to say that the movie will let you wonder if there is any added dimension you have with you loved one br br it's very obvious that i enjoy this movie a lot considering the fact that the movie is so plain in appearance it is paradoxically one of the more cinematic movie i saw lately,1
2260,i don't know what movement was this film about i saw this film a year ago i am an orthodox woman living in an orthodox community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie it's so far away from the reality it's scary the director could at least hire a rabbi for a brief consultation before making a realistic movie about ultra for example morning prayers or a jewish wedding or a ritual bath customs br br movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies but it's not them that bothered me it's the spiritual side are portrayed next to taliban woman are powerless while men are the ultimate rulers please no one can force a jewish girl to the against her will we also live by the law which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife no beating and no raping also and no man even rabbi is allowed to peak at the woman in the and is not to place a hand over woman's head while she's taking a ritual bath the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time director was clearly trying to bash ultra but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner br br love story cute but not credible dialogs are long and boring the ending sucked totally for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending for all that sitting i felt i deserved it obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews or for non jews perhaps look at those fundamentalist they are so evil and mean and they succeed long thing short was hoping for a nice kane level movie got instead a tradition bashing unrealistic mistakenly guiding junk i mean today we live in a time of a free will as never before everyone has a right to choose chose a rock singer made her choice meir made his many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days because in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway,0
2261,i get really fed up with sitcoms you feel you always know what is coming so it ceases to be funny on the other hand hi de hi you rarely know what is coming and it's laugh out loud funny i have just purchased the second set of the series series 3 4 and i am surprised at just how much i am enjoying it all again i have nothing but praise for the writers or the actors or the many unseen crew members because the entertainment they provide is well worth the wait the gems that have come from this series and the respect that the actors achieved through it speak for themselves croft and perry created some pure gold some of which shines through hi de hi,1
2262,i first heard of this movie at the flashback weekend in chicago 2007 for the nightmare on elm street robert englund was really talking the movie up and he was great in his part of hatchet the same can be said for tony todd knowing this is a low budget first time director writer it delivers every bit as much as the big budget and also cameo laden 2007 remake re imagining br br technically it falls short in a couple of places the alligator attack seen was shoot too dark when it happened the dark head of the alligator against the swamp on to the black pants became almost invisible the mood music in the swamp scenes was too loud in volume and canned like a bad sitcom and just like 2007 someone is smart enough to have a gun but of course shooting the killer is only a pause button for the killer the ending well as soon as i saw where it was going i knew what was going to happen not very original br br the highlights of the movie are the characters and their interactions unlike 2007 we got to meet the people and care what happened to them ben joel moore who is also the lead of spiral the sulking lead and marcus not another teen movie as the best friend and funny man to root for during the movie shapiro joel murry dharma greg jenna and misty mercedes mcnab of buffy the vampire slayer the series angel the series and the addams family movies give a convoluted reason for topless women mr and mrs played by television regulars richard grounded for life step by step as the older couple that you know don't stand a chance even the tour guide shawn parry shen is a fleshed out character i hope to see more from all involved in this film but i think it will play better on home video than in the theater sorry,0
2263,for me this is another one of those films that i got to see off of the los angeles based z channel when it was in service and it was another one of those movies that i saw when i was young and learned that there was a world out there one i did not want to accept br br moving to los angeles and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date no premiere channel programming has matched the z channel in its showing of international films the three international films that stuck in my young head were spetters beau pere and of course this one pixote br br this was the most shocking and saddest movie i ever witnessed in my life this was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema to entertain and to inform let me be honest growing up in a small town on the east coast i had no idea anything like this to this extent existed all i knew from south america was brochures of fabulous vacations and that columbia had a lot of drug trafficking br br then comes a film like pixote sad disturbing unflinching scary you're watching children those that need shelter love understanding and all these get are a way to survive day after day through drugs sex robbing stealing sleeping on the streets and in sadistic group homes etc their survival is hard to watch with other street children prostitutes etc and you begin to wonder how can things like this be allowed to happen in this world br br pixote is not a film for entertainment it is a film of information it shows shocking and disturbing images but it shows life for these daily street children,1
2264,when this was first aired on masterpiece theatre it had a profound effect on me it's beautifully filmed and acted i immediately read the book by mary webb and it remains one of my all time favorites janet mcteer is wonderful as and i fully expected her to become a regular on the british drama scene i guess she chose to focus on the british stage instead br br i was hoping that with the american success of janet mcteer years later with tumbleweeds this film would again become available to us alas it has not yet been released on dvd if anyone out there is listening please make this available again,1
2265,this is definitely an excellent show i don't have cable so i started renting them because my friend recommended it i thought it would be a teen soap you know who's dating who that kind of thing but it was not it is surprisingly deep it is also very witty it moves at a very fast pace and there are more and more jokes you catch every time you watch it it is a comedy drama which is rare when well done it is about rory and relationship instead of the classic mother daughter relationship it is a story of the best friend relationship about a mother and daughter the characters are perfectly cast and all do a superb job it is definitely the best tv show i have very come across,1
2266,words almost fail me to describe how terrible this irish vanity project funded by canadian both federal and really is br br there's a sudden appearance by a nice looking canadian woman kathy who in real life was a star athlete in alberta for no other reason to ensure canadian content credits also indicate that certain calgary pubs were of assistance br br everything here is poorly filmed and at least third hand chunks of poorly digested trainspotting lock stock snatch and reservoir dogs are the most obvious steals avoid like the plague unless you fancy one of those campy so bad it's almost funny nights in front of your telly,0
2267,i love it i love pauly shore it seems some people don't agree it's humor and he's not like everyone else the movie is great i love the story line and most of the people in the movie it's funny from the first time she meets him at school i like the fact that she chooses him over the guy back home i like that tiffani isn't a bad girl in the end all the secrets are let out only the people you want to see are left in the end except for those of you who don't like pauly shore even if you don't like him there are funny parts and her family tortures him through most of the movie she's country girl gone wild and needs to be heard she finally makes it it's got just the right amount of love and romance i give it an 8 out of 10,1
2268,i saw this movie in the early 70's when i was about 10 yrs old on tv it was on after school and as i watched i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out she let me so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to and cared enough about to record just the audio there were no vcrs at the time the plot will have you hanging onto every word every minute of this film the ending will blow your mind after watching the journey to the far side of the sun you will have flash backs in your mind about it for a long time i did replay the audio recording for many years and saw it over and over in my mind then maybe 15 years later when vcr's were common and they sold tapes in stores i always looked for it but never found it but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second so after about 30 years after seeing it for the first time i got to see it again wow it was spectacular just for reference i must have watched it 50 times since,1
2269,a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns helped no doubt by a smooth talking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite much to the delight of her husband this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good br br from the very opening scenes with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny although not too far off the mark this is most definitely not true br br unlike most movies of this genre this is not really a sci fi or a horror film but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a sci fi scenario into the plot it's not a good or even mediocre drama but it will exceed your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and most importantly it is well edited and excellently paced it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next nevertheless this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like attack of the 50 foot woman,0
2270,i think that key west might do well as a dvd there probably are a lot of failed star treks that just never had a chance to succeed we will never know if this could have been a great series i would love to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another hollywood footnote is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal oddballs can enjoy them again the show had a great writing talent and some if not all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters that is often missing in todays hit shows i often came away with a sense of learning something from the story lines and greatly entertained by the very unique characters thank you,1
2271,wagons east was a big disappointment for me but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candy's last film role he died just before shooting was completed on this there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof and for a comedy that doesn't cut it if you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies the answer is obvious see mel brooks' classic blazing saddles or if you want to see candy in much better material see summer rental spaceballs or uncle buck just to name a few these three movies as well as others shows us what a great comic actor he was wagons east does not what a shame br br out of four,0
2272,the stories were pretty weird not really funny and not really cunning i'm not sure what the point of the stories was the first story was actually mostly sick the second was just really really pathetic and the third was only weird the fake baby was actually quite badly made,0
2273,with knightly and o'tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or not the number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low cost heartstring elements,0
2274,it didn't feel like a movie and was thankfully short under it felt more like a commercial of in computer graphics most of the special effects are great to be sure but that don't a great or even a good movie make not saying it's absolutely worthless viewing since it's possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci or what ever it's called br br as i read somewhere you can't fix it in the cutting room a bad story and non directed actors can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from br br however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea since usa is the crooks br br and isn't it sooo typical of low budget stories they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico br br well well i it 2 just because of the special effects the rest is absolute trash,0
2275,a plot that is dumb beyond belief however that said it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare and that is as it should be it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma br br hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into and she does so with gusto good for her br br ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script br br and to grant show as well a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps ryan's hope melrose place he is always versatile and underrated his primary drawback seems to be his impossible to ignore good looks he is a sturdy well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do br br the rest of the cast is basically window dressing br br the direction is adequate and the script as i alluded to is fairly idiotic br br watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing it's fun,0
2276,to put it simply mind of mencia is the worst unfunniest show on comedy central and quite possibly all of television ever i love comedy central and watch many shows and movies there all the time but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy i can't find the remote fast enough br br mencia tells used worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say 'they liked it so all of your race likes it and by extension me too' give me a break mencia i don't know if those people are plants or not but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes doesn't mean he thinks you're funny it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do smack you on tv he gives the impression that his jokes are deep meaningful and thought provoking which is apparent in his commercials but when you actually watch the show almost 100 of what he says is common sense he also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade carlos the guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking but i think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous and that's why they never said it in the first place br br all in all watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must because after you've seen 1 episode you've seen them all why comedy central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me if you're looking for good comedy look elsewhere because you will find very little of it here,0
2277,what a waste of precious time my 5 year old daughter brought this home from my mother's house and we watched it as a family none of us liked it this wretched little film rife with glaring inconsistencies overt christian themes and horrible film quality is not worth watching even on a dare it felt a bit like a bad high school drama class attempt at film making how sad to see talented actors chris atkins gary busey and company flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute the film can should have gone straight to the pound avoid this film your time is better spent watching paint dry,0
2278,after the atomic bomb hits hiroshima charred bodies lie all around deformed victims attempt to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them and one person after another dies of radiation sickness this black and white film however sad and scary is not without humor the story revolves around a young woman who was hit by black rain after the explosion she is trying to get married but everyone keeps dying and people are worried the same will happen to her after finding a suitable mate who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long she ends up showing signs of radiation sickness this film is a great portrayal of the atomic attacks on japan it will frighten you and will perhaps make you cry the acting is good not overly dramatic like many other ww2 films that have been made,1
2279,this movie is just as bad as it gets if you like logic or the lack of it la national treasure and bad acting as well then it could be a movie for you br br otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer br br actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved ie actors special effects and so on they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent br br in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product br br it is really lousy,0
2280,many times the description full of sound and fury signifying nothing is used and is right on target unfortunately code 46 lacks both sound and fury a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated tim robbins character william is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria samantha morton seems almost absurd these folks are so passionless that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine there is a brave new world sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2 3 stops overexposed unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes the cutesy mishmash of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence many futuristic scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance this film has neither flash nor substance its a code 6 all the way,0
2281,i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci fi and received a big ol' commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby pushing the own works 'watch the has in the past referred to the 'giant and 'space exploration' movies from the 1950's including such favorites as earth vs the flying saucers thing from another world and forbidden planet as well as them deadly mantis and tarantula there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like space monster 12 to the moon and cosmic man br br this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors directors stunt men and collectors plus the non hollywood from the era been interviewed i only wish there was a 0 rating available since a 1 is much to generous,0
2282,for my money probably the best film or at least the most purely cinematic film director ford ever made the dialog is swift clipped to the point l the story starts at the very beginning and only ends with the final credits ford uses a relatively small cast but directs them and photographs them with a verve and a sweep of epic proportions grimly realistic warmly amusing brilliantly acted hard to believe couldn't become a leading man after this with the best photography and editing in any american black and white film owes an awful lot to sergei eisenstein's editing technique but never as coolly detached or as eisenstein could frequently get and a great musical score a magnificent panorama of an important and poorly understood episode in american history br br one little quibble it's not clear why the film involves the mormons who as far as i know were never the pacifists the quakers and amish were this confusion leaves a slightly bitter after taste br br however the rest of the film is such a feast this is easy to ignore in all other ways a true masterpiece of american cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again and again and again,1
2283,if you enjoyed films like pulp fiction reservoir dogs and lock stock and two smoking barrels you are going to love two hands it has the same type of black humor beat to it and will keep you entertained through the whole film like pulp fiction it has the wacky scenarios that the characters get into and how they deal with them along with gallipoli and picnic at hanging rock this has to be one of the best australian films i've seen it also stars a young heath ledger before he got real big in the states br br this is a terribly underrated movie that i believe is just as good as pulp fiction and those greats you have to see it,1
2284,i am not so old that i can't remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells br br from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades br br if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago this movie is worse it was not even funny by accident it is sad pathetic and a total waste of time may hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood,0
2285,this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen this in my opinion is rob lowe at his best i'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental,1
2286,family guy when the show first aired it was fresh original and actually quite funny now i have stopped watching it it has become one of the worst shows on television combining unfunny jokes repetitive drawn out jokes and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word bitch seth clearly has issues with himself and he is obviously pandering to the 13 year old boys audience br br i just don't understand how something that started out so funny so different from everything else can devolve into this horrible mess of a comedy show i seriously have heard better one liners from a comic br br it truly is sad to see great shows fail and watch drivel like this continue on either seth has stopped trying or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it is br br either way god help us br br i hate this show and will dance an irish jig when its finally cancelled,0
2287,given that dylan thomas is an icon of modern poetry i expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject on the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible a drunkard a bad father a and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still i do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits any way i found the other male hero of the story captain a more endearing character the two female roles were played by actresses and miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded londoners during ww2 another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive that think that age old conventions can easily be surpassed the atmosphere of the blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it's possible political outcomes i think one would recommend such a movie,1
2288,bwana devil is reputedly the first major studio full length feature filmed entirely in the 3d process supposedly producer went to africa to shoot a different movie but after hearing the tale of two man eating lions terrorizing railway builders decided on this one it's a good story too almost hemmingway like fear redemption the great white hunter and all it's the telling of the story that seems to drag almost as though filming in the new process was too weighty for the crew the action scenes are stiff almost too staged but these technical problems appear small in light of the film's dramatic conclusion,1
2289,a really terrible movie really low budget with terrible acting a convoluted and inane plot a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science br br the result is a total mess without meaning for most parts with very limited and cheap effects it is not even fun like several of the low budget independent movies of this kind br br a waste of time,0
2290,i remember seeing this in the early 90's on uk tv and was hooked the international scope of the production is breathtaking and watching how the characters develop through the five hours it runs for is magnificent the scenes set in pakistan and afghanistan are of particular interest and as a viewer you get a real sense of a grounds eye view of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing stages of the cold war the characters of and helen develop really well throughout the series and rivals modern shows like the sopranos and six feet under in this area in the uk the vhs goes for about £6 and the dvd about £10 a quality bargain i thought soderbergh's version was great too but clearly owes this masterpiece a huge debt,1
2291,this movie will give me nightmares i will wake up drenched in sweat screaming i didn't make this film please don't blame me i honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating lard in his moms basement for a hour or two than to watch this crap i understand money was tight but goddamn what the hell were they thinking there was no thought plot or effort put into this this movie needs a warning please for the love of god don't fund the drama department a the local jc on an other note these are the least likable characters i have ever seen and i have seen movies with hitler in them so lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred and let the sleep come,0
2292,what looks like a ho hum porky's rip off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love br br the story concerns three friends gary ricky and david who spend their after school hours looking for sex when a new girl arrives in town gary falls head over heels in love with her br br the film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities it is funny and sad at the same time it never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made you know the guy meets girl guy loses girl guy gets girl back in the final frame formula that formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl maybe that is why i liked the film so much br br the soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker it also might be one of the most realistic endings i've ever seen in a love story br br,1
2293,the only reason anyone remembers this steaming load of fecal matter is because it was scored by pink floyd or as they were known then the pink floyd stefan a really annoying eurotrash hitchhiker hooks up with american model estelle and they proceed to get high and naked throughout the whole movie br br and the point of this is what exactly that drugs are bad or only heroin horse is the problem becomes that you don't give a crap about the characters and for that matter even pink floyd wasn't up to their best work when overdoses at the end you are almost glad to be rid of him because he was so annoying,0
2294,the minutiae of what's involved in carrying out a robbery is what makes this one of the best of all heist movies then there's the robbery itself a wordless thirty minute nail biter that has never been surpassed followed by what is probably the cinema's most pronounced example of dishonor among thieves as things begin to spectacularly unravel and we have what is unquestionably the greatest of all heist movies br br this was a tough and unsentimental film when it first appeared in 1955 and it is just as tough and unsentimental today it displays some of the edgy brutality of dassin's earlier brute force there isn't a flabby moment or duff performance in the entire film and dassin captures the milieu of seedy clubs and parisian back streets like no one else and the final drive through paris by a dying man is one of the most iconic closing sequences of any movie a classic,1
2295,okay maybe it was because i happen to be in china when i saw this movie maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny whatever it was this movie was worth the time br br i had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hooked br br the plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movie br br it goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one however the action is mostly slapstick so you don't always have to read the entire subtitle to get the idea br br the main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isn't bad to look at either they are both worth watching finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isn't a bad choice for both br br i don't speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better overall i give this an 8 out of 10 and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china and keep for when i come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie,1
2296,it's another variation on the oft told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length but with a scarcity of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half hour limits of a tv show br br doris day decided to call it quits after this film and it's rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help brian keith barbara hershey pat carroll and alice do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen br br nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films,0
2297,i cannot understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to scene set and pad out the plot showing that someone has a skill right before they use it i believe is offending our intelligence it's starting to feel a little contrived and as though they are making up for being so vague for the first three series a little disappointing this episode br br furthermore using past quirks like locke's ability to know when a storm is ending is frankly insulting are we supposed to ooh and or laugh at the softer side of locke br br this episode was all over the place,1
2298,as you can tell from the other comments this movie is just about the worst film ever made let me see how many different words i can use to describe it boring unbearable laughable lousy stupid horrible br br i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point br br i would have given this a 0 if possible bad acting bad directing bad production bad plot br br this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965 very low budget boring plot horrible acting really bad special effects etc br br i rarely ever see a sci fi film i absolutely think is this bad i mean this is pure garbage it has nothing going for it either as far as a b movie this is the very bottom of the lot br br i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes junk like this gives good low budget b movies a bad name this makes ed wood movies look good br br the thing about watching direct to video movies is just when you think you've seen the worst you see something even worse br br dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out br br avoid this waste at all costs oh the humanity,0
2299,nickelodeon has gone down the toilet they have kids saying things like oh my god and we're screwed br br this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking or aren't in the in crowd it say that sexual promiscuity is alright by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary friend sam who may be a lesbian beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path which says it's alright to be a b ch this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it i give it a 0 out of 10,0
2300,i went to the movies to see claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well diahann carroll was never better than in this role we saw ms carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her naked smoked a cigarette drank beer and oh she cursed whenever this movie was shown on tv and finally cable i would call my friends to watch it just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to gladys knight and the we saw a black woman struggling to raise her children dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself finally this movie made it to dvd and well deserving,1
2301,it is a surprising movie that gets you in your chair waiting for the last minute of the film leaving on your leaps a sweet taste of i want more there are very good actors portuguese actors that have a lot of experience in the world of theater and films it is not a million euros budget film but still we can see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective that gets you in the movie if you have the opportunity of getting your hands on this excellent film don't wait for another minute just see the film i think that portuguese film are increasing the quality watch out spanish producers the portuguese are getting a high quality standards i saw the film and i'm waiting for more,1
2302,a very funny movie michael douglas' do is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason i'd like to see him do more of these low life roles he was terrific as were all the performers br br the film struck me right off as an american only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didn't need no subtitles br br in a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so two of the best were with john goodman not someone i am crazy about 1 he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says i had to wipe the smile off my face the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles but probably doesn't know it 2 the scene at the end between goodman all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform and grappling with the be reiser hunched over a table and the two of them then protesting that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene this alone deserved a special comedy academy award,1
2303,ok so it can be done we have here the perfect vampire movie gothic beautiful with all the ingredients a realistic vampire a wonderful story take note i am from transylvania and i assure you this movie respects the vampire lore it's exactly like the tales i heard in my childhood for a transylvanian it is quite believable you must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent hollywood movies as far as i can guess the hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus which is pretty hilarious for me vampires are never good looking or attractive they can inspire only horror and repulsion the incubus called in my country the night flier is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them i strongly recommend this for any gothic person out there see also the sequels they are all 4 very good and of course don't miss dark shadows something similar is nosferatu in venice with klaus kinski i recommend that one to,1
2304,this movie is almost never seen today the only reason i can enjoy it again and again is from a slightly worn out vhs copy i made when the film was shown on tv in 1991 here in england br br an ensemble cast are obviously enjoying themselves and this is reflected to the viewer a razor sharp script helps things along and once you've seen this you will want to watch it over and over again br br wayne rogers is the 'star' but everyone contributes to a great film with a great jazz soundtrack to boot there are emotional moments during the film but never to the point of sickly sweet sentimentalism these are guys on the trip of a lifetime and they convey that excitement wonderfully br br highly recommended if you can actually get to see it,1
2305,i wouldn't call myself a big fan of the genre inventive silliness so i might not be the best audience for this show although being a critic i do have a sense for what i personally like and dislike this being the later br br lack of humor is a big turnoff when it comes to comedy things can be catchy cool and perky for about 4 minutes and after that you start getting bored unless its the badger animation from a couple of years ago this is the exact opposite with a stiff script and all overacted voice overs its just plain silly and very very boring to be subjected to unfortunately since it did have a big market ahead of itself and a lot of potential br br a waste of time,0
2306,i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a clearance warehouse sale one day when just looking around the cover looked pretty good in colour but the movie is b w i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with coloured covers on b w movies but it's a common thing to look out for br br when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised it turned out to be better than i expected i was disappointed that it was a b w but the effects are pretty good certainly better than say invaders from mars which has crappy effects and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogan's heroes br br overall this movie isn't too bad for a b grade and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view it isn't my favourite sci fi but it's not my worst either it's o k,0
2307,normally i hate period films living in england is a nightmare at the moment if you have an allergy to period dramas which i do however this one is the best it doesn't take itself seriously and jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are great together liv tyler's good as well although her english accent is dodgy br br the film has everything for someone who just wants to go the cinema to enjoy themselves it has action adventure drama and comedy i'm not sure how well the jokes will translate across the ocean but hopefully they will it would be a shame for american audiences to miss out on this film it shows that english film makers can produce something that doesn't involve constant swearing and sex both do feature in this but in a balanced format robertson's camp portrayal of the well to do gentleman is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class set are hilarious br br as the trailer for 'the spy who shagged me' is to say if you see one other film this spring make it and it's got fun action and of course jonny lee miller with an english accent for a change,1
2308,the best scene of the people across the lake is the genuinely creepy nightly opening scene featuring a house a murder a lake after that it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned a family mom dad sister younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake from then on the film features too much lame happy family related doo doo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there the couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings on featuring just every day life stuff of the family settling in the truth to the matters the mystery as to who's doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this made for tv thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film it's not really badly made the content story is just not interesting enough the only highlight in the cast is barry corbin though his performance character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious blond cutie tammy lauren the daughter might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in wishmaster 1997 and made for tv outings like i saw what you did 1988 the stepford children 1987 she hasn't got much to do in this film though but watchable if anything,0
2309,el padrino the latin godfather while this seems to be a straight to dvd video type movie my copy obviously looked cropped so maybe this flick had a limited theatrical run and the title character appears to more of a gringo than moi i am half pretty typical rise and fall of a movie with the a list of b list actors robert wagner drug lawyer kathleen quinlan crusading judge tiny lister mob enforcer gary busey child rapist brad dourif white power jailbird stacey keach bereaved governor pacula bereaved milf faye dunaway crusading lawyer and make as an uncredited party guest this movie is pretty lame i only watched it to kill time before the skins game the only thing that saved it was jennifer tilly as a crazed latina drug dealing assassin she was over the top and sexy skanky that it was fun to watch her scenes not worth renting or seeking out d,0
2310,i never thought i would absolutly hate an arnold schwartzeneggar film but this is is dreadful from the get go there isnt one redeemable scene in the entire 123 long minutes an absolute waste of time br br thank yu br br jay harris,0
2311,othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters and the terrible rendition of the love that desi john had made this movie the horrendous filth that it is by far othello directed by jeffery saks is beyond mediocre and atrocious br br the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend in the opening scene of the film it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief moments later ben john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is br br by far this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself with that being said it does have a miniscule amount of good parts for example the love that was shown between john and desi was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable just as it was explained in the book although the love between them was shown exceptionally well it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should br br love jealously deceitfulness this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel the novel however really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could for example the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film much more detail is also put into the novel this is why this film is such a disappointment trust me those who have read it will find it disappointing as well br br in conclusion this film was by far the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind by avoiding to see this film not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben popping out at them,0
2312,humphrey bogart in his first starring role looks very young acts well but has a pronounced lisp only hinted at later in his career still he's very good and very appealing as the idealistic young inventor of a new airplane motor br br dorothy is the real star here playing a once rich woman who's torn between her real love for bogart he's broke too and the comfort and security of marrying an older man hale hamilton br br along for the ride are astrid allwyn as bogart's trampy sister bradley page as her would be producer barbara leonard as the jack kennedy as gilligan and halliwell as the faithful and wise butler br br both had been a star in silent films and bogart were trying to gain a in talkies in 1932 bogart was a slow rising actor from the broadway stage was slipping and would soon appear in skid row production like picture brides yet they are both very good here wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this film,1
2313,i didn't really concentrate on the larger genocidal aspects of the story although the horrific images at the beginning are very powerful i was really taken with the human story of the girl and her family imagine living your life not knowing if you have a time bomb ticking away inside you i was really wrenching to see being rejected as tainted by the bomb the image that stays with me most is when stands before the mirror combing her hair silently watching it come out in,1
2314,women will like this movie better than men of course women like all romantic comedies more than men on average i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit however i considered this a 5 5 for the first 50 of the movie and about a 6 5 for the next 40 and about a 9 for the last 10 so begrudgingly i will rate it a 7 i tape and keep all movies rated a 7 or better and none that are a 6 or worse at least that's my objective i have over 1200 movies so why keep the dogs br br my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me though i'm not sure why i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is br br the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school undercover to write a story about the high school experience nowadays she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around her journey toward as well as her falling in love with a teacher is the story br br what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog so much so that i truly don't think i want to see her in 15 years when she gets up in the morning argh naturally she transformed into a rather attractive cute woman by the end and she became very popular br br the ending is about a 9 9 on the very sweet scale so you out there will like that otherwise it isn't very memorable and easily missable,1
2315,in this dream come true i found myself loving what was going on it's a good movie and should not be passed off as a corny fantasy movie it's too smart for that it's definitely a feel good movie but with a nice message to leave you with 7 10 b 1 2 out of,1
2316,throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the american c i a can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind in the beginning their objectives were simple spy remove enemy agents steal classified information and destabilize governments years have elapse and although their mission remains similar their clandestine black operations now include domestic spying u s citizens and infiltrating american organizations who criticize the u s government this movie however centers on the c i a 's world manhunt for the infamous 'carlos the ' the film is called the assignment and tells the story lt cmdr ramirez aidan quinn a u s naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist bombings recruited by jack shaw donald sutherland of the c i a and amos ben kingsley a special agent from the israeli ramirez is secretly trained to look pose infiltrate the elusive organization and to thereafter discredit the real working for the russians this film is explosively exciting and packed with wild chases killings and inter country mayhem quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war easily one of his best efforts,1
2317,though the video technology may be dated this classic musical play now on dvd is the best version of sondheim's most important and polished work on broadway if you've never seen sweeney todd then you must buy this dvd i saw this production in november 1980 at kennedy center in washington and fell in love with a pre murder she wrote angela lansbury subsequently i tried to find any and all of her work among them movies the harvey girls the picture of dorian gray manchurian candidate cds mame dear world and gypsy and many more the rest of the cast is flawless too all in all this wonderful dvd gives us the definitive version of sondheim's opera,1
2318,screen treatment of the comedic broadway success the gay divorce a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers though it was used in the u k concerns a man and woman fred astaire and ginger rogers meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse they dance argue make up dance argue some more and dance some more betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit singing and dancing in the number let's k k with overtly edward everett horton but the star couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout the surroundings are screwball sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one dimensional 1 2 from,0
2319,over all it was a real good movie though all the actors besides jones sucked by the time i was half was through it i was really getting tired of seeing only change i would have made to it would to have more flash backs possibly with the real cobb,0
2320,i really love this movie it has a very real feel to it i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter however because of the subject matter it makes the movie all that much more important br br this is an a movie and i recommend it highly if you liked 1984 book or movie i think you will like this one as well br br this is harsh to say the least including mental and physical acts of torture some pretty vile not for the week at heart or stomach no gore but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn't need blood and guts br br if you are not a realist or a person i don't think you will enjoy it it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans what they're capable of and the very real possibility that our government s does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it's heart,1
2321,i love this movie despite the fact it just misses being great it's an adult entertainment full of issues that a grown person can relate to the acting is superb it's fun watching john cassavetes and gena rowlands as a feuding middle aged couple who knows how much of it came from their own marriage susan sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character aretha raul julia is a hoot as a lusty the scenery in greece is spectacular the new york settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the world trade center fantastic score by with so many things going for it why isn't this a great film it's a bit rambling and overly long unfocused and uncomfortably imbalanced between humor and drama still it's engaging entertaining and deeply thoughtful,1
2322,this film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability bruce willis as the never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld instead he bumbles about in broad daylight parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises why this man has never been captured before or even identified is beyond me not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring considering the price he demands for his services an exorbitant 70 million his methods are decidedly low budget and stupid br br as for those in pursuit of him they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior they show no sense of expertise instead relying on half baked which sends them traversing across the country at their whim incredibly these far fetched guesses maybe he bought a boat maybe he's in chicago etc etc invariably lead them straight to the who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp br br richard gere whose irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the fbi he actually makes a compatible partner if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals at one point he actually confronts the infamous but unfortunately the fbi although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication what kind of operation are they running here br br the film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever the supposedly stealthy acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim's cheek with blood br br the film's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic and many moments are ruined with melodrama this movie is poorly executed on many levels the one bright spot being the ever consistent sidney poitier avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it br br,0
2323,from 36 lane to 15 park avenue sen has indeed traveled a long way if the first one goes down in history as a clean sweep the latter will definitely carve a special place as a mature film until you see 15 park avenue you cannot imagine feeling thrilled and moved at the same time thrilled to see the director's ingenuity and agility in portraying seriously challenging situations and moved by the sensitivity echoing throughout the film it is not a movie that merely makes you feel how difficult life must be for but makes you ask a much deeper question about the reality that you see and believe sen has done a brilliant job in highlighting this supreme fact of our existence that we all are in some way or other trying to live in a make believe world of our own trying to run after mirages called happiness peace contentment along with the depiction of a delusional mind sen's magic has brought forth many little nuances of human relationships as they sustain stress and strain the fact that at times we all lose calm break down make wrong choices be haunted by guilt behave selfishly and so on is captured with extreme by sen she showed the cruel dilemma which shabana had to deal with all her life of having to choose between a schizophrenic sister and a normal life with a husband and kids for herself and in the act of always being beside her sister always being a strong persona providing support making judgments and so on she unknowingly cut off some of the oxygen that her sister needed to bloom isn't this a very harsh truth that at times in an attempt to do the best for someone we strangle their assertiveness and end up hurting their self esteem of course and acting deserves laurels as always because had the ingredients not been so good the dish could not have turned out to be so extraordinary sen once again made a masterpiece of a movie for those who crave for some food for thought bravo,1
2324,though i saw this movie dubbed in french so i'm sure it lost something in the translation lack of accents etc it was an excellent fun movie for a lonely night in a hotel room a real pick me up that portrayed accurately and positively the complexities of individual sexuality gender role and finding a place within the communities to which one is supposed to belong male gay urban 30 ish etc i was very proud of french television for showing such an honest and positive portrayal of the gay community while the fact that the gay lead character ends up somewhat straight in the end is mildly disappointing that's life and that happens sometimes this is a great movie whether alone or with a date a really enjoyable experience,1
2325,a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried the quality cast stark setting and excellent made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry the soup had no seasoning or meat for that matter a 3 of 10 for effort,0
2326,a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s that's all they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty five maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching topics but i can't imagine that at that time anything shown in was regarded as br br shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower the selection of songs doesn't involve anything but the very very well known that are still heard on every second radio station today the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny eskimo is dull flat and not aesthetic almost unbelievable that it had six sequels,0
2327,i was pleasantly surprised to find a very enjoyable film that kept my attention throughout i am a horror fan and i see almost everything in that genre but dead line managed to freak me out the pace is very cleverly set and andrés does a good performance as a desperate man what is underneath the main plot a trip to madness how can you end up like that martin sanders ask him self while he sees a homeless speaking to him self alone in the street close to the end of the film the character of aaron mandel asks the same question while he sees another homeless doing the same thing not knowing yet that this homeless is martin sanders answering the question of the beginning of the film the broken eyeglasses in two are a clear symbol of rupture and division of personality the ending is jaw dropping and you just know that a sequel would have to be made,1
2328,1st watched 4 30 2009 4 out of 10 dir john waters corny waters like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience john waters directed this music filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny depp playing the title role this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled hairspray but this one is not as effective some of the tunes are catchy some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters like way and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone the storyline is similar to the movie grease where there is a good group and a bad group the guy from the bad group cry baby a girl from the good group the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her she falls back to the good group this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back now one difference that is expected in water's movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you know what i definitely saw this in hairspray as well the wacky and goofiness isn't really all that much fun in this movie though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better the prime appeal of the johnny depp character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek thus his namesake at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him this is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok but not that great,0
2329,one of the worst movies ever made let's start with the superficial joaquin phoenix is first of all too fat to be a rookie fireman the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys john travolta has a bad dye job and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender the plot hits on all the tropes and clichés of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like they all get drunk get into fights have a hard time expressing their emotions their wives all stay at home crying they all have father issues everyone has a boston accent et cetera an execrable piece of that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9 11 which was by the way valid cultural hero worship this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship,0
2330,this documentary was boring and quite stupid br br i mean the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works it is a theory and the name is just plain dumb reading a college biology text book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is darwinism is a good theory but evil if it is done as politics br br also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people no expert testimonies and shady leads br br the documentary was also boring i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been lots better br br there are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can get better information from wikipedia d don't waste your money and time,0
2331,this movie is such a waste of talented people and hollywood budget it made me think everyone in the movie was paying off a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible trash pile of a film it's a contrived plot that is just pathetic unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting the only thing that kept my interest was the numerous big names in the movie that kept popping up for no apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to the mess of a film i kept expecting it to have some good stuff since all of these people had been cool in other films but it never came through this film should be shown in prison as punishment but that would be cruel and unusual you will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and horrifically bad acting this movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with lots of recognizable faces big trouble 2002 which also went off the readable scale on the suck o meter,0
2332,yes bam cried a couple times and so did englund and most probably you will too the whole cast is back in action and knoxville has stepped up to become the true leader of this gang of messed up retards i mean this in the best possible way i first thought maybe bam or steve o were the main go to guys nope the main man is now johnny don't get me wrong everybody and i mean everybody is great in this flick right from the get go you're laughing and believe you me don't plan on resting that smile of yours i personally think the movie definitely has better moments than the first you know when you go into a theater and you kind of don't want to have high expectations for it well this movie blows all expectations away if you love jackass you can go into this with gigantic expectations no matter what you'll laugh your ass off if you're not laughing the reason is most likely someone has a gun in your face telling you if you laugh you die or maybe you are embarrassed about the sound of your laugh or the highest probability is that you were eating jack sh t for breakfast and jack left town all i have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face after the movie,1
2333,before watching this movie my thoughts were like another israeli typical movie but i was suprised to watch i great israeli drama the plot is really good and the actors act great one of the best isreali movies i saw so at the bottomline i really recommend this movie,1
2334,the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical stylings so obviously their music videos aren't going to be exactly normal in fact these little videos are abnormal and bizarre but have a huge artistic value to them the atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals it's a great watching experience br br basically icky flix just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs the music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like it's straight out of an 80s horror film what doesn't change is the quality of these videos they're great br br any fan of art films will love these they're so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed at and the lighting especially make these so interesting the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini classics that deserve multiple watchings this is a near perfect collection of short videos br br my rating out of 56 mins,1
2335,the sad thing about frontline is that once you watch three or four episodes of it you really begin to understand that it is not far away from what happens in real life what is really sad is that it also makes extremely funny br br the frontline team in series one consists of brian thompson bruno lawrence a man who truly lives and dies merely by the ratings his show gets occasionally his stunts to achieve these ratings see him run in with his line producer emma thompson alison a woman who hasn't lost all her journalistic integrity and is prepared to defend moral scruples on occasions the same cannot be said of reporter brooke vandenberg jane kennedy a reporter who has had all the substance sucked out of her so much so that when interviewing ben elton she needs to be instructed to laugh her reports usually consist of interviewing celebrities with whom she has or hasn't with before or scandalous unethical reports that usually backfire martin de mora is the reporter with whom the team relies on for gravitas and dignity as he has the smarts of 21 years of journalism behind him his doesn't have principles so much as a nous of what makes a good journalistic story though he does draw the occasional line parading over this chaos in name is mike moore rob an egotistical naive reporter who can't see that he's only a pretty face for the grubby journalism he often finds his morals being compromised simply because brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest br br frontline is the sort of show that there needs to be more of because it shows that while in modern times happiness safety and deep political insight are interesting things it's much easier to rate with scandal fear and tabloid celebrities,1
2336,the best of everything is a high gloss large screen soap opera which follows the careers of four career women hope lange suzy parker diane baker and martha hyer at a new york publishing firm what's the best for some women is not necessarily the best for all br br presiding over this group of young is wise old mare joan crawford who's been around the track a few times on screen and in real life she looks right at home as the boss lady as well she should have at this point br br around the time she was making the best of everything joan crawford became a widow when her fourth husband alfred steele died it was a particularly traumatic event for her she woke up one morning and found him dead in bed next to her she inherited all of his stock in pepsi cola where he was the board chairman and during the same period as the best of everything was being made she wound up the queen bee at pepsi cola life does sometimes imitate art so that authority as she barks out and coffee orders to hope lange rings real true br br in fact all the women here with the exception of lange are in for some rough sledding it's rough for lange too but she literally makes the best of everything br br what a collection of stinkers the men are in this film the best of them stephen boyd is a heavy drinker the others louis robert evans and brett halsey are as slimy a collection of rodents as ever gathered for one film br br i can't forget brian either who's the fanny pinching head of this publishing firm half that office would have sexual harassment suits going today br br some nice location shots of new york in the fifties make the film a real treat catch it by all means,1
2337,i don't care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence br br the show is crap how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it yet it was received so well this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there br br i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry br br it is beyond belief that people can watch this show yet i guess the creators had the last laugh making themselves wealthy by taking the p ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this br br i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank,0

2339,well i am so glad i watched this on hbo instead of paying for it in the theaters or video store the movie has some points but if you want to make it a worthwhile movie i suggest that you become what the main characters are called stoners br br 2 10,0
2340,this film was one of three that were later combined by chapin into a compilation that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title the chaplin review br br this was an odd film in some ways because later in life chaplin was anti war and his movies stressed peace and brotherhood this film in contrast is a propaganda comedy meant to bolster the us efforts in wwi it's truly odd to see charlie as the super soldier who single handedly captures 13 germans casually and coolly shoots several germans in mere seconds as a marksman and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the kaiser himself truly this was a major departure for the little tramp though it was at the same time very very entertaining and funny the film is exceptionally well paced well made and i'm sure did a lot to bolster support at home for our troops too bad it was such a pointless and costly war,1
2341,anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film it's interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content br br my honest opinion 3 out of 10 for this effort maybe next film will deliver,0
2342,i won't lie i rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex i got that scene and catherine deneuve's briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like did i have a mother or father i don't know paraphrased usually delivered in long soliloquies br br if you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button i was still too slow,0
2343,this is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show people say its witty and intelligence i don't see how maybe because the characters use fancy words maybe because they are snooty use dry humor and have 2 dimensional personalities i went to an ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters in fact had i met someone like them i would have likely strangled them the men act like little emotional pre teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes the characters are no at all authentic simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated this show is just another cookie cutter hit that brain dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis,0
2344,a gentle story hinting at fury with a redemptive message and glorious celebration the photography is wondrously well executed cinematographers look at this kind of film to hone their craft not just for what the eye can do to enhance a story but what the right camera vocabulary can do to heighten an emotion feeding the soul is by definition what this movie addresses but with an elegance and grace of delivery that simply doesn't not happen much anymore at least with this degree of taste restraint and finesse if you care about story and character development this is a also a great movie to see as an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill out a character's impression match all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived and you'll get this movie,1
2345,how does anyone keep on seeing horror movies after this one really this one it's so bad that makes me sick and love horror movies but come on who could had remembered to do such a awful movie it as no history it's only a men who chases a bunch of teenagers because they take something from him and what have they took gold it's typical the movie is boring from the beginning until the end and what is karen black who is a great actress doing in such a ridiculous movie like this but what can i say i think everyone should see it because my opinion is my opinion may be you would like i don't think so but,0
2346,first off i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song thriller in its soundtrack to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem on top of this let's face it thriller is a boring 14 minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless vincent price poem just because vp recites it doesn't mean it's not lame and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but don't forget this also happened at the same time the a team was the 1 show on tv so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos what exactly did this add to the equation that billie jean and beat it didn't already add from what i can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos not quite my definition of great,0
2347,there is not much to say about this one except that it is probably the worst of the early spate of zombie movies i may get to watch another one revolt of the zombies 1936 before the month is out for all star john carradine's intention of building an army in the service of the third reich with them they are not seen to do much at all james uncle remus from song of the south 1946 plays their leader who also serves as carradine's manservant black comic mantan moreland reprises his 'fraidy cat' chauffeur role from king of the zombies 1941 as does the exotically named madame te wan as carradine's housekeeper unfortunately for carradine his supreme achievement  the zombification of his wife  brings him all sorts of trouble not only do her relatives turn up at his remote abode lab to inquire into her sudden death which means he has to fake a funeral service but she actually proves disobedient and indignant eventually her fellow zombies to rise against their master also involved is cowboy star bob steele still best known for his bit in howard hawks' the big sleep 1946 who plays a u s secret agent posing as a nazi posing as a sheriff thankfully director would have much better luck with his next genre effort the day of the triffids 1962,0
2348,another great musical from hollywoods golden age i liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from broadway and all its glitter although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform gene kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers rita hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine trouble begins for gene kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town phil silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job of course there is the music and the dancing one dance performance by gene kelly stands out he is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window his reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets great cinematography don't miss this one great entertainment,1
2349,i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i a 39 years of experience would suggest do know what istanbul has gone through all those years br br faith akin is still quite young born in 1973 and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey just as his other movie gegen die wand did this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out quite false clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul br br anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands groups depicted in the movie for one are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as of the contemporary turkish music much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all br br we turks have long been accustomed to westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director faith akin is making the same mistake looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better all of a vain effort br br just ask any turkish friend of yours what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names manco ibrahim and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today br br faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music,0
2350,i will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100 if perfect br br visual pleasure 100 this is extremely pleasing movie visually i had a great time watching it golfing scenes are very well shot and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing i also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag br br director's work 70 bill paxton is more associated to acting but this film shows he's got talent did a decent job br br acting 90 shia lebeouf was very good in his role of francis this guy can act well the rest of the cast was also good br br entertainment value 100 i enjoyed every minute of it it was overwhelmingly entertaining br br script 91 based on a true story and therefore it makes the film that much more special it was intriguing right from the start and loved every scene till the very end br br br br my advice definitely a must watch for all the sports lovers especially golf you all will love it anyone who is looking for a nice entertaining movie and doesn't hate sports can watch it br br br br 10 10,1
2351,if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons one many of the world's are of questionable registry nationality and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often a language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint anyway it's fascinating reading br br horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinema br br i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee i also as usual loved omar epps,1
2352,after my daughter was born in 1983 i needed to lose weight i tried the 20 minute workout and i was hooked i lost about 50 lbs it was the most weight i ever lost in my life i can't believe this show is forgotten it would be a blessing if you started a cable channel strictly for exercise and included the 20 minute workout i think this was the best workout video ever made i wish i could purchase it somehow and somewhere the routine was easy to learn and you did work up quite a sweat the workouts they have today are too complicated and too hard to learn please do your best to get this video back in circulation i pray it will be a blessing to all who see and use it,1
2353,i think that this is a disappointing sequel i miss a lot of the old characters king gator anne marie etc and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters a lot of personality was lost in charlie and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one if you're a big adgth fan like i am it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book,0
2354,one true thing puts zellweger in the midst of a family crisis as an adult journalist who returns home to care for her dying mother streep somber and plodding the film studies the adult child coming to terms with the adult view of her parents as they are slowly revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up knowing as a child an excellent character study and a find production with little to fault ott offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some plaintive reflections on life and death,1
2355,what an incredible story and what a beautiful film hat's off to ben daniels and the great honore de balzac this captivating film conveys the passion experienced by the characters so effortlessly and yet so powerfully i watched it mesmerized almost holding my breath as the story developed towards its inexorable end this film's execution was almost flawless simple and pure it plays with our hearts guiding us in understanding the strange platonic absolute thus possessive bond between two creatures not meant to be part of each other's world both are capable of affection yet ironically it's the more evolved one who becomes dependent and possessive unable to accept the other's freedom it's one of the most fascinating and intriguing look at the many forms of love and an incredible study on how oppressive and destructive human love can be sometimes br br only a rudimentary mind would associate this story with any kind of bestiality,1
2356,hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first time viewing basis hannibal is bad terrible inept lame droll idiotic contrived laughable and utterly atrocious no pun intended minor spoilers follow br br this movie has huge logic holes more than any bruckheimer bay movie or for that matter any movie that exemplify the indulgence of hollywood exaggeration it's a slick hollywood production designed to cash in on hannibal lector mania directed by so somber he takes this way too seriously hack director ridley scott and produced by a hack italian producer with an inflated ego whose credo is doesn't matter whether film is s t money is good br br i can't get over the fact that acclaimed screenwriters david mamet and steven wrote this tripe adapted from a lame and pretentious book by a good novelist turned hack author thomas harris david and steven well known and immensely talented screenwriters wasted their effort on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks another factor in the disappointment of this film br br there are too many ludicrous scenes to list that are laughable in clunky execution and poor logic e g starling cell phone in the midst of lecter pursuit that turns up inspector as the victim not to mention laughably bad dialogues delivered by tony hopkins with a smirk and julianne moore ray liotta and others who cannot act with the straight face hopkins gives the true meaning of scenery chewing along with hammy acting by gary oldman as a deformed psychopath bent on exacting revenge against lecter br br the gore effect is good but only serves to repulse rather than provide suspense which is notably absent from hannibal the predecessor silence of the lambs is more believable with tension and suspense suspense is what made silence of the lamb work as a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller not to mention superbly written and tensely directed the brain dinner sequence is so laughably fake it borders on self parody br br the ending is kinda blatant and idiotic are we supposed to believe that lecter is still a menace to society with the last shot establishing his glittering eye glaring at you ooh scary br br,0
2357,another sadistic and ultra sleazy late 70's early 80's revenge movie wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his last house on the left although terror express is more like a rip off of other rip offs like i spit on your grave and especially night train murders storywise this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director was to multiply the sleaze factor by a thousand this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women but the sex in terror express isn't unsettling at all on the contrary these spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves the music is great the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever the villains are wimps and the train passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets this is your film however your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be terror express should be in the porn section of videostores,0
2358,perhaps the best movie ever made by director kevin tenney well his witchboard is not on the top of my all time horror list this one is a strange fascinating mixture between pin and child's play both better than this one but not so better sure the plot is contrived and perhaps too predictable but the actors are good rosalind allen is very pleasant to the eye and so is mckenzie god bless her for the shower scene the child actress is very good in interpreting the disturbed daughter and the pinocchio puppet is scary enough to give you a few thrills down the spine for a b movie not bad at all,1
2359,dr pena giancarlo esposito a zoologist fancy term for one of those self deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare read nonexistent animals and his crew of hunters manage to trap a a big elusive fast moving beast to get it to the mainland they smuggle it on a cruise ship and some idiots open up the crate containing it despite being told specifically not to i guess the strange growling noises coming from inside weren't a good enough deterrent either the monster then does the monster thang running around biting chunks out of various passengers until the ship's captain john rhys davies a square jawed special agent pretending to be an insurance salesman for some reason dylan neal a squeaky voiced blonde tai bo instructor simmons a bunch of guys with machine guns and others try to stop it the main victims who i think are supposed to be the comic relief but it's hard to tell are an old rich bitch paula shaw with a terrier and a snobby effete gold digger david apparently the monster can be knocked out with a single tranquilizer dart but can live through dozens of bullet hits the design is acceptable though unoriginal but the rest of the movie is devoid of suspense surprise or interest a boring sci fi channel original movie they've made dozens of movies just like this with nearly interchangeable characters and plots but with slight alterations on the creature enough already,0
2360,man i had my doubts i love kathy bates but i thought how good can this be i had never even heard of this thing you know it was one of those things we gave it 20 minutes and we'll turn it off if it sucks and we were locked in from the get go this is a very winsome fun movie it's quirky you know i mean you've got a lounge singer a murderer and a believable one you have farce then kathy bates in all her acting splendor rupert everett finally acting to his real potential dan ackroyd and a dwarf that will make you laugh out loud i tell ya you'll laugh you'll cry br br maybe i had a weird week but i think this film is on the level of fried green tomatoes if you don't like that movie maybe you won't like this but i think it was a great movie i went out and bought the dvd,1
2361,a really awful movie about a 30 meters long shark bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost even if u liked jaws which i averagely did don't see it even if you have interests in don't see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors corny plots during corny tv time do humanity a favor and do not i repeat do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci fi animal thriller still some people gave it a ten ranting don't know if they were serious or not but sincerely expect they weren't,0
2362,there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans its quite good and its been done and redone in film and tv many many times some are notable but this urbanized version that injects the tired old racism themes just flat out stinks leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script chaplin this guy isn't there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic freakish way but its just not enough to carry a movie you have the usual nazi or neo nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think type villain who's son of course is gay german accents get the picture,0
2363,with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie well it is a stupid movie with a horrid script but the f x namely the eight legged freaks makes this flick a hoot to watch a tribute albeit on the silly side to those great mutant creature features of the 50s arquette and sheriff sam kari wuhrer summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona also in the cast are doug e doug rick leon and the charming scarlett johansson,0
2364,i would ward off any temptation to view this movie it is quite simply dull the characters are predictable and mindless the assassin is quite there is no tension fun no style or even a glimmer of originality to be found in this train wreck and the morass of hollywood cliché's are stifling oh and you have a movie that makes a hero of an ira terrorist cute and now i need to speak some more to fill up the ten lines and a little bit more is that enough not quite how about now no well further should do the trick but the is really not worth ten lines of exposition the original was great though,0
2365,may have known what he was doing when he made but the rest of us can just sit back in and confusion trying to figure out what that purpose might have been br br the nominal plot involves a young african singer who's planning on leaving her unemployed husband to find work in the city but far more of the screen time is taken up with what the publicists for the film describe as a mock trial against key financial institutions dealing with the overwhelming economic hardships of africa that's all well and good i suppose but when the arguments and ideas are put forth in as undramatic and pedantic a way as they are here they lose both force and impact put another way if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the injurious effect of colonialism on the african people and the problem of african debt into anything even remotely resembling a compelling storyline the film might have achieved the intellectual and emotional resonance it now so clearly lacks br br the topics the movie is dealing with may be relevant and important but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth of speechifying as an actual honest to god movie is not likely to garner much of an audience for one's message,0
2366,this completely forgotten slasher flick is one of the best horror movies ever made very dark at times it reminds me a little famous thriller deliverance director jeff creates terrific atmosphere of dread and despair all actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable so if you are searching for something creepy try to find this little treasure my personal rating 10 out of 10 p s this one is even more chilling than halloween,1
2367,for this movie based off of a tv show and a serious finale i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious 'm a s h goodbye farewell and was pretty good but not this one unless you really love the series like myself skip this movie br br i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens but the plot was too gimmicky and dave coulier man that guy hasn't done anything good well ever they shouldn't have used tim meadows he's a great actor but he was too good for the script br br i thought the movie was pure cheese i would give it a 4 5 10,0

2369,it's strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best you've seen this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller guns techno baddies cash etc and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also ran i would credit this to two very charismatic people christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i've ever seen on screen another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to after the beginning the jamaican resort is so beautiful you'll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night with a i know i did i'm very glad i saw this movie it was just too nice to miss,1
2370,i just purchased an running out of time on dvd and it was an excellent film i must say not really action packed in terms of gun play but definitely exciting and witty i do not think i have seen andy lau in better form and the editing on this film was very well executed go watch this now if you are a fan of lau or hk action film,1
2371,i admit it now this is one of the lamest films ever made but in mr defense the not really scene wasn't all bad br br and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry dennis hopper br br what makes this scene so perfect is that father answers the blonde swedish speaking jewish girl in german br br the best actor actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of mother this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting but still puts in the most convincing performance of all br br all and all this flick is nostalgia for me personally it is after all what gave me a posting on imdb s database d br br like a movie star,0
2372,korea's answer to i know what you did last summer follows a similar story route to its american counterpart one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kill a classmate a masked killer begins to pick them off one by one who could have possibly seen them that night or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea br br originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this are entertaining and scary record is neither churning out badly rehashed scenes from i know the house on sorority row and the faculty among many others and failing to deliver one decent shock throughout the 95 minutes br br acting is decent from the cast who as seems to be the norm in korean cinema approach an uninspiring script with gusto and an undeserved enthusiasm direction is mediocre at best however a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer's costume ever contributing to downfall most disappointing is the film's ending where the two are that obvious you've earlier dismissed them as being too blatant br br only saving grace is its bright start the first act is actually excellent and shows the american counterparts how character development and setting the mood are supposed to be done but other than that this is a very poor movie not recommended br br,0
2373,i suspect there are several cuts of this doco doing the rounds the copy i saw focused heavily on joe's erotic films and referred to his horror output in passing there are numerous x rated films presented in their x rated glory and emmanuelle in america's legendary snuff footage the breasts being cut off is given generous screen time br br the interviews with the highly likable joe are informative and candid he is an unassuming articulate gent and discusses his interest in shocking audiences why he wanted to mix erotica with horror and how he may have been responsible for one of his performers turning gay br br his friendship and working relationship with indonesian beauty laura gemser is touched on as is his indifferent attitude to shooting hardcore br br joe d'amato personifies an incredible period in continental cinema that has now passed it is great to see a documentary dedicated to him and his fine unique work br br rip joe,1
2374,possible spoilers br br i thought pitch black to be quite enjoyable with some nice effects i liked the larger beasts although they aren't a patch on the aliens from the alien series it had quite a good atmosphere which i felt vin diesel helped contribute toward br br one thing which kind of stumped me was how it if the planet has three suns and is in almost continuous daylight where did the moisture come from to form clouds and therefore rain br br i liked the fact that fry died at the end it reminded me of the new hollywood films of the 1970s with the main heroine not making it to the end,1
2375,wow most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen br br the shift from the early days as a new york based black american phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture and largely west coast based is profiled well br br the humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex these djs take the required skills for any musical instrument dexterity rhythm and timing among others and apply them to a new technology with several more variables br br dj comment that he pictures what music must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out seemingly silly at first makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create br br some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip hop culture one film at a time people,1
2376,if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life how do you even think of comparing this with 'a wonderful life' it was absolutely awful the boy singing made my toes curl and what on earth was the deal with his hair emmy worthy performance please granted lucci did ok but an emmy i think this film is a waste of money the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse it lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts lighting wardrobe make up it seemed everybody wanted to go home just a big no from me,0
2377,had no idea what i was going to experience viewing this old film from 1940 however i always enjoy viewing laraine day katie who plays the role as a younger sister to jean muir helen and also their mother billie burke mrs julia thought i was going to be bored with the story of two sister's and a mother who is overly protective of her daughters until they meet up with robert cummings ridley crane who has the reputation of being a millionaire playboy who has plenty of gals and is a heavy drinker who parties all the time one night helen goes on a date with ridley and he proceeds to get bombed out of his mind and simply cannot drive his car it is at this point in the film when this becomes a drama and changes the complete direction of this film which will definitely hold your attention right to the very end of the film,1
2378,rarely have i seen an action suspense movie that was so boring none of the action scenes are exciting the story line is nothing special and except for a couple of actors the acting is bad charlie sheen platoon major league stars as the white house chief of staff who gets himself in the middle of a conspiracy that wants him and more people dead donald sutherland a time to kill fallen plays a friend who he tells everything he can and linda hamilton linda hamilton terminator dante's peak plays a reporter who gets involved in the situation charlie sheen is ok as the star donald sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance linda hamilton gives a poor performance with a bad movie i can actually like it if it has a good ending but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost laughable stuff,0
2379,i bought this movie at a thrift store months before my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we've seen once i spotted the cassette i knew i had to have it i watched it that night i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done that's what drew me to it i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through i recognized gregory the ice cream man but i didn't recognize his name and i couldn't remember where i saw him later while watching the andy griffith show clint howard ice cream man was featured as an extra since he is ron howard taylor 's brother i saw the credits and i gasped i turned to my mom who was also watching the show and said that's the ice cream man she too gasped this movie is great but only for laughs and it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low budget movies rent this video,0
2380,i saw this before ho at the fantasia film festival in montreal everything about it is either tipping the hat to or completely ripping off tim burton i enjoyed it nonetheless even if it is extremely derivative what most impressed me was the quality of the visuals given the obvious shoe string budget the set design and the props were inventive and original although the script definitely was not,1
2381,for comedy to work there are many factors involved br br 1 don't be afraid to take risks 2 if anyone or anything deserves to be poked fun at do it and continue to do it br br but most of all br br 3 be funny br br the war on everything succeeds in all those three things in fact the show proved to be so popular and so funny that already only months after it's first episode a dvd of the first season was released i picked it up within days of it being released and hit the floor laughing and had so many fu ing tears in my eyes it's that well good br br in short and to save me blabbing on about the show watch it buy it it whatever will make you watch the fu ing best show in the world br br go the chaser,1
2382,this film makes about as much sense as an or a 'father knows best' episode an old copy of reader's digest circa 1962 would provide more insight into modern life or the relationship between a father and a daughter than this weird concoction br br i was surprised with diane keaton she appears to sleepwalk through the film given the film's title i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct supporting character br br i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy,0
2383,this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen the part where they loose there daughter with the poltergeist overtone rip off just pushes it over the edge with stupidity i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft core porn scenes in it i have to say it made me laugh my ass off the 80's 3d effects were very out of place included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen,0
2384,there are other movies about boarding schools and the antics of the students and staff but the belles of st towers above them all the plot has been thoroughly summarized by other posters so i won't cover the same ground i just want to say that it's a shame that it's finally out on dvd but in a format that can't be used in the u s br br enjoy fellow fans in new zealand and australia and if anyone reading this has any pull in such matters please help get it released on dvd with region 1 also is it possible to be notified via e mail when i won't say if it is released on dvd in the united states thanks,1
2385,i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company br br attended the uk premiere last night zane and brook attended they probably knew i was gonna be there and are undoubtedly stars but what a turkey of a film i felt sorry for them at times when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes br br but perhaps i was missing the point perhaps an element of tongue in cheek was intended if so pure genius if not career genocide br br on the plus side zane always shines and brook can actually act a little as the other half said as we ran out the cinema avec broken ribs they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people the scriptwriter however should be marooned,0
2386,i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood i'll tell you that and i have seen a lot of so called surfer flicks in my life after watching north shore for the first time just now all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid if i had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene i would sold my board and totally gotten into i don't know accounting or something br br seriously this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life the acting is terrible the music is worse the cinematography is iffy at best and oh my god what was laird thinking wow do not see this movie it sucks if you want a real surf flick see riding giants hell watch surf's up instead of this seriously sucks sucks bad sucks real bad br br ps had to change my summery from wtf to wtf because apparently we are supposed to whisper on this site no yelling d,0
2387,talk about rubbish i can't think of one good thing in this movie the screenplay was poor the acting was terrible and the effects well there were no effects i can't believe the writer of this movie did identity everything in this movie made me sick to start to finish br br the front cover of the video box shows a showman with shark like teeth and scary eyes i looks like a scary villain but like the old saying never judge a book by it's cover the whole villain looked like a cardboard cut out one part in the film a girl gets killed by a salad tongs terrible the setting was bad enough like they could of set the whole thing in but no a tropical island instead br br i took this movie as a spoof which i think they wanted it to be but the only thing that made me laugh in a bad way was the tacky effects you can argue that i haven't watched the first one but seeing this i would be safe if i wouldn't attempted it br br the biggest joke in this movie is the effects the snowballs looked like they were home made and that carrot was a complete embarrassment if i would of guess the budget of this movie would of probably be between 8 to 9 pounds fifty the producer in a last minute panic must of grabbed the actors for the street gave them the script told them they have 6 minutes to practise these lines and shoot on a island br br lastly the acting in the film was painful it was like the actors forgot their ordinary lines and made them up the way through br br in conclusion i give this film 0 stars out of 5,0
2388,there were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight but one thing that really bothers me is that if jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom what happens if never shows up what if was killed by danny before he made it to the bathroom does jigsaw simply just get up and walk out could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw but another part of game what if killed the wife and kid how does jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot it was too late it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead it wasn't the best time for heroics these are just a few questions i had about the film but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once please help,0
2389,if you had a mother that described you like that you just might be looking to bump her off yourself it's how danny devito feels about anne ramsey it's just how to put the plan in action br br and his creative writing class taught by professor billy crystal gives him the idea that and a viewing of alfred hitchcock's classic strangers on a train which gives devito the idea to switch murders with crystal who hates his wife kate mulgrew who not only is cheating him out of an idea for a book he wanted to write but is also carrying on with hunky tony br br throw momma from the train plays out kind of like strangers on a train as devito seems to have carried out his end of the murder scheme but crystal's having a bit of a problem putting ramsey down even with danny's help that woman might need killing but she's going to take a lot of it br br the only academy recognition that throw momma from the train got was an academy award nomination for anne ramsey for best supporting actress ramsey lost to olympia dukakis for moonstruck but the film turned out to be her finest hour ramsey already had the throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year but look at the list of credits she managed to even after throw momma from the train she worked right up to the end br br i've seen interviews with both of the stars of throw momma from the train billy crystal and danny devito and both have gladly conceded that anne ramsey's performance as the mother from hell both made the film the success it was and stole it out from under them their acknowledgment of ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute br br if marion lorne in strangers on a train had been anything like anne ramsey here farley granger would gladly have joined robert walker in disposing of her throw momma from a train is one of the best black comedies out there should not be missed,1
2390,how do you describe perfection in the mood for love maggie cheung and tony leong practically dance on the screen and give stellar performances that stay with you hours after you've left the theatre every scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of superb cinematography and shot selection top notch acting and the sensual soundtrack nat king cole singing in french absolutely sets the tone for the whole movie maggie and tony look marvelous with maggie slinking about in some truly glorious and tony always looking dapper i've seen this movie several times already and everytime i see it i find something new to rave about love it,1
2391,this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life a woman the ex pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex husband killing people for no reason in baths to achieve her goal the women i don't think ever went to acting college she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera failing on most occasions she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son she does this to use them against her husband at first when you watch this film you think that the ex wants to kill her ex husband maybe because he has treated her in a bad way but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment using whips of course my advice to the general public is do not buy this film do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did at 1 on fox,0
2392,what a waste john travolta and scarlett johansen deserved better than this to start at the beginning jt was horribly miscast in the lead here the role called for someone who could convince as a broken down anti hero someone who could look haunted and defeated billy bob thornton would have fit the bill or even al pacino but jt is just too alive and looks to be having too much fun also surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent character had would have suffered some physical effects the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the oakland raiders scarlett faired little better role wise where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development and as for the plot well none of it makes sense the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause and certainly without explanation the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired namely pace this is a very slow film not that i have anything against slow films as long as they are heading somewhere the pace only picks up towards the very end when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clichés as possible in this it succeeds the only thing missing being something involving a small dog 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel performance he was the only member of the cast who was a well cast and b able to convince in his role all in all a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours,0
2393,this movie must have looked when it was being pitched at development stage and getting a redgrave and a jacobi on board must have excited the money men all i can say is that they clearly did not have anything on that week jacobi camps it up in the way that only jacobi can do and i thought that he seemed to more of the actor that he parodied in his cameo role in frasier a few years back vinnie jones is not exactly bad he is just clearly out of his depth as a leading man he is really quite amiable throughout and if this was a pilot for a tv series it may have just got picked up however the and the camera work were appalling quite why this and a press officer from the met would ever work together is never explained it certainly cannot have been because of the sexual chemistry of which there is none there is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far fetched plot that you can pass off as original but the whole thing is just so contrived that the two stories just do not make sense at all it was like two stories confusingly edited in to one just to make up two hours go watch some paint dry for a couple of hours you life will be more fulfilled than watching this rubbish,0
2394,i saw this movie awhile back and can't seem to track it down does anyone know where i can get a hold of it i feel it is worth seeing again br br i'm sorry to say i had never heard of chloe until this film yes she can act when i first began to track this movie down i mistook it for another one of her movies sex spa the plot seems similar to me but the roles are reversed br br this is the first film i've seen dru berrymore i looked up some of her other films and i feel she looks better as a blonde br br i agree this is a good introductory movie not too soft not too hard you got to start somewhere,1
2395,spoilers more than likely nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves yeah it's really weird i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box only a list of the bands that had songs in it but after that i had a of a time finding it even here on imdb i kept confusing it with night of the demons but you know they're basically the same thing br br the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time even when screaming wasn't really necessary he'd let out a listen up now block the door with cars and so they'd run cars head on into other cars but then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us what was it why was it there why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen but he was kinda far away i mean he could have just turned the tv off yes this movie was shot on a whim and yes i hated it good day,0
2396,i was lucky enough to see this film at a festival last year and had half expected it to get a release the fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder has surely inhibited its success but as i understand it was never the intention of the film maker to make it look like film in the first place it was more about the story the characters and their relationships is that not what films are supposed to be about but it did have a quality in the texture of its visual appearance that suggests may thomas is onto something we should pay attention to for independent film makers and producers alike who have a the talent and lacking the money and drive a lot can be learned from watching this film technically it has everything going for it the use of light music etc by far outweigh that of any other digital feature film i have ever seen and therefore it is worthy of much praise the actors performances are believable to a point if not slightly under played i felt there was much more in there more depth in particular from the male lead john paul clarke but one thing that really does bother me as a film maker myself is the film being in black and white a need to cover up a multitude of sins than if it was colour do we have more to learn in the progression of digital technology or is this the future of wonderful affordable film making,1
2397,i grew up in new york city and every afternoon abc would show the 4 30 movie saratoga trunk was one of the first movies i remember watching as a kid i loved this movie and it has stayed with me for years i recently watched it again and still thought it was great maybe i am just a romantic but i thought it was well done i do not want to say this movie was good only because of the main actors i really did not know who they were when i first saw this movie i guess i just knew quality acting as a child both bergman and cooper were excellent i especially loved seeing old new orleans during the time period of this movie if you ever get a chance to visit new orleans you should watch movies that show the city during that time period when you get to see some of the old homes in the french quarter not just bourbon street or uptown you can truly imagine life as it was 100 years ago br br i love old movies this one to me is a good flick,1
2398,one of the earlier reviews of this movie ends with only for big fans of the lead actors or fans of exotic romance adventure movies as if those weren't reason enough to love it anyone who after seeing this movie complains about connery's accent or the lack of historical verisimilitude or the realism of the political motivations or any other extra movie concerns simply doesn't love movies see it and be awed by the star power of the two leads the exotic romantic photography and music and the bold adventure of a truly escapist film this is proof that hollywood can make 'em like they used to when it really wants to a solid 8 10,1
2399,francis ford coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of american cinema in the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance open and among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the united states has ever had i am not a historian but all the events that preceded the decade a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the american political and cultural scenes the racial struggles the emergence of the 1960s counter culture the increase of violence and death in the streets seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare be different and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film making following the parameters of war and adventure films and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life the reason of death or the ethics of war it is also a passionate work made against all odds chronicled in the 1991 documentary hearts of darkness a filmmaker's apocalypse a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the vietnam war ever to reach the screen this may not be the definite vietnam motion picture but dealing with it coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two vietnam movies made simultaneously the deer hunter and coming home or in latter ones as platoon and casualties of war before vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre as horror in jacob's ladder or comedies as good morning vietnam among the more respectable coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war,1
2400,this film is a great rampage of action and comedy it gets right in to it right from the start there's no boring build up the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending even though my suspicions were not satisfied the special effects worked brilliantly and were believable would have liked a different ending but it still had me reeling in emotions the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details to fully understand and get maximum enjoyment br br,1
2401,valley girl is an exceptionally well made film with an all around great cast even though the dialogue is a bit dated now when the movie was released it was very hip to this day i know many people teenagers included that cannot form a sentence without using the word like that is without a doubt the legacy this movie will leave a rating of 8 was given for this like most excellent movie,1
2402,i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson he is his usual self in this one maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t v the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a team but not on the big screen even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from bronson's revenge against the bad guys skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend,0
2403,i had completely forgotten about midnight madness until just now when i found it while surfing the imdb now it's all coming back to me br br it was one of naughton's first movies as well as fox's and sharp eyed connoisseurs will also pick out kaplan henry from tv's alice fiedler he does the voice of piglet in the winnie the pooh cartoons and blocker son of dan hoss blocker from tv's bonanza br br but the two that stand out in my mind are furst from animal house and the himself eddie furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad why can't you just accept me for who i am his dad looks over his obese slovenly frame and gives a simple one word response yuck br br and well he's a show in himself as a latter day jerry lewis he stumbles around wades through mini golf ponds puts melon halves on his ears and ends up having maggie roswell fall for him my hero br br as for the film it's typical early '80s stupidity with college kids staying up after curfew and going on a city wide scavenger hunt to prove which division of students is the best on campus the jocks the nerds the rich kids the feminists or the group made up of a little of each br br who wins who cares you'll have a lot of fun watching disney pictures' first foray into pg territory before creating touchstone pictures br br seven stars catch midnight madness any way you can br br long live leon,1
2404,wicked little things was a really good movie i will say at some parts it seemed really unbelievable and others it seemed as if there just wasn't enough thought put into the actions of the characters but overall it was exciting and entertaining i don't understand why this movie's rating is so low nor do i not understand why all the horrorfest film's ratings are so low these are b movies people and nothing more they provide great entertainment and most of them don't have many flaws at all this is definitely worth a look because you won't be disappointed with the outcome wicked little things is one of the best 1st annual horrorfest films and compared to a lot of other films in the series this is one of the best overall,1
2405,postwar england the dawn of the atomic age yet the worries of a young schoolboy yearning to experience his first kiss cannot be derailed by something as inconsequential as the bomb this was a delightful if not educational look at young love from the vantage point of an adolescent male and his world of the br br 1940's free of political correctness and preachy messages this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind and br br hormones of a young teenager can create wonderful subplots br br maintain character interest ala gregory's girl and plenty br br of well blocked shots help keep up the imagery of this era this is a very good story for anyone young or old who has br br ever been in love or ever wanted to be does he ever get his wish watch it and see,1
2406,thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by charlie as a crime deflector things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for and his nonsense i normally like but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way actually i think it didn't help that the mystery wasn't very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didn't make up for everything that went before not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try,0
2407,the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a deep sleep inducing voice then it is high time to put an end to it i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a movie it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen total waste of time and money the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets this is the worst movie i have come across,0
2408,this film looks great and that's about where my praise ends love is a many thing came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955 when candy coloured nonsense like this co existed with trail blazing artistic fair like kiss me deadly as a trend toward smaller socially conscious films like on the waterfront and marty established itself in the mid 50's other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade and love is one of the latter br br this is the kind of 50's movie where the technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high key even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day i never want to hear the theme song again as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime and i certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill ear piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles jennifer jones and william holden are passable but really anybody could have played these parts jones' role is horribly written her character is incredibly inconsistent and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be br br people will undoubtedly tell me i'm taking this film too seriously that i'm unromantic etc but i loved all that heaven allows released the same year and just as cornball in its own way except that douglas sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form whereas henry king director of love is not br br i'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama but in this case i was just bored br br grade d,0
2409,one of my favorite movies of all time beautifully done well written and well acted it portrayed 20 something blacks in a way i don't think has yet been duplicated and the dialog hmmmm so stimulating makes me want to find love like that,1
2410,we saw this film in toronto at the film festival last year it was a truly moving experience i had heard of the truth and process but as others have written did not know much about the details of the process this film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people are able to face up to their pasts understand the events from the points of view of others involved and grieve together archbishop tutu and the others involved in developing the t r process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions seeing this film gave me hope for the human race if we can do t r we just might not destroy ourselves people will look back at t and r as the first step out of human adolescence and toward maturity br br as a film of course there were flaws i did not notice any major problems in acting directing or writing but for the first time in years i was totally lost in a film so perhaps i did not notice br br see this film the audience in toronto would not give up the stage for the next film we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director tom hooper jamie bartlett and went outside to the sidewalk to continue the conversation people came by just to shake their hands and thank them for the film it moved us all,1
2411,michael radford has done an excellent job bringing this difficult play to the screen he has taken a play with a reputation for anti semitism and shown us that shakespeare knew quite well the humanity of the jews radford said after the screening and i agree that shylock is his first tragic hero the first of his characters to be undone by a driving compulsive need for revenge he also points out quite rightly that a man who was anti semitic could not have written speech of if you prick me do i not bleed radford is himself of jewish descent and he has picked out the good and bad of all characters with delicacy and honesty no character is free from flaws no character is evil radford has placed the play in the 16th century which gives a lush background of venetian politics and decadence on which to project shakespeare's words br br if you get a chance to hear radford speak about the film i highly recommend you take it since he gives details about life in 16th century venice that illuminate a lot of the choices he made and give considerable extra depth to the viewing i'm hoping that the dvd will come out with extensive commentary br br jeremy irons does a gorgeous portrayal of antonio a man who himself to bearing the burden of his past misdeeds lynn collins a relative unknown gives us an absolutely flawless stunning and detailed job as not only is ms collins beautiful she also gives layers of intelligence and humor prior to the trial scene i've rarely seen in any production of this play the rest of the cast also does a terrific job with a notable performance by kris marshall as and a beautifully subtle work by allan as playing the foil to shylock finally while al pacino pulls out his usual strong and loud performance his best moments are when the camera focuses on him and he says no words but you can see all the emotions and flowing into and out of him as he perceives his fortunes changing br br if you like period movies i cannot recommend this movie enough,1
2412,this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen all characters are brilliant br br mr david bamber is a very very irritated man irritated by everything and anyone br br he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble not supported by his wife janet who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into and really does not need the help at all br br all characters are played portrayed brilliantly just imagine sending your kid s to a school like this br br it is unbelievable that people do not like it maybe some don not get the many many plays on words that are featured many times per episode br br it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it there are only 2 series br br so please release it let it go so the fans can and will enjoy it br br try it you might just like it br br just some names words from the series man helmet hot bitch mount suzy travis fellatio and many many more,1
2413,8 points for take on probably what really kinda maybe more what it was like back then american indians probably stole more than killed who really knows nice slower odd pursuit means it has a pace and interesting and unique thankfully not another mindless shoot em up i thought this would suck at first i wound up getting wrapped up nice treasure good job i have hopes nobody dissects this film when the entire movie unfolds you have many unique twists impossible to determine what will be next the characters are human and have either honor or not passion or not forgiveness or not wound up loving the white horse the indian sheen even the damned desert all good,1
2414,felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines a ham a ham my kingdom for a ham sandwich the dramatic guy that tells felix he'll have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies he's in tears felix just looks at him like he's nuts and shrugs his shoulders the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood felix thinks how does he expect me to get the money br br in minutes of course this is a cartoon he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat 500 if it works br br well it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home in an outrageous scene felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to hollywood transforming himself back to cat when they get there br br we then witness felix's attempts at getting into show business his audition scenes are very funny especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives in all quite a bit of material is in this 9 5 minute cartoon it's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2 5 minutes assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length br br at any rate there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes crazy stuff,1
2415,two hands is a highly enjoyable aussie crime caper which ultimately succeeds by the way the film easily combines tense dramatic moments with very funny characters and situations to give the film the right balance and feel the comedy of the film occurs naturally and the laughs haven't been set up too elaborately haven't been too worked at it really is very funny thanks to the fact that each character in the movie is excellently cast and that each actor actress recognises and can relate to the aussie humor they portray it very well and very realistically of course they're helped out immensely by a fantastic script by writer director gregor jordan i was reading another review of this film by an american who had seen it and he heavily criticised it basically passing it off as a pulp fiction clone i think that that's just rubbish this film isn't trying to be pulp fiction the feel and style of each of this excellent films are totally opposite without wanting to sound superior or arrogant i think to fully understand this film the humor the sincerity the characters etc you have to be australian or at least understand the culture which the other guy obviously didn't have the faintest clue about some americans whose reviews of certain non american films seem ignorant to and have trouble comprehending anything that isn't an american product it's a real shame because this is a really great film the love story featured between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real sincere and sweet way i'm very proud to have this film in my collection 4 5 out of 5,1
2416,the filmmakers were clearly on drugs that's the only explanation i have how else do you explain this travesty of a jane austen adaptation northanger abbey is a parody of a gothic novel but this film was made as if it were a gothic novel the bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug induced hallucinations rather than a naive innocent girl with an overactive imagination as catherine of the novel is br br the actress who played catherine just stands around bug eyed all the time peter firth looks at least 10 years too old to play henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me i don't see the attraction between him and catherine john portrayal was rather odd but isabella actually wasn't that bad but nothing could save this piece of crap movie one more thing this film invents a character not in the book a french friend of general the why exactly they added her is beyond me must have been the drugs she is scary looking beyond belief with white foundation red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face dimples br br you'd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad it's good quality but unfortunately it's not it's just bad,0
2417,this is a tv movie based on the murder of martha in greenwich in the mid 1970's based how much on truth it's hard to tell this much is certain it is based on the book written by mark anyway the movie depicts the crime in flashbacks and its aftermath including the arrest of a suspect some 25 years after who was never considered a suspect at the time in the movie of course is largely responsible for the arrest and closure of the case for martha's surviving family in particular her mother the narrative of the film is by the ghost of martha talking in the first person this is a very effective device in this movie to me it adds more impact to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim if only an actress playing the part maggie grace plays martha and i was really impressed with her there is no way for certain to know mark motive in investigating the crime it could have been out of a sense of justice and maybe he really cared or maybe he just saw dollar signs from a future bestselling book either way it makes for an interesting movie it's well acted and fairly fast paced i don't think there was a lot of extra unnecessary stuff in the movie just what was needed to tell the story one could argue that they left out things that would have shed a bit more light on the proceedings and one would be right also one may argue that the ending was abrupt and again one would be right but as i said for me i think they told the story with at least most of the essentials anything else would have likely required a miniseries as an aside there is a miniseries entitled a season in purgatory which came out 6 years 1996 which this movie has some parallels to even if only faint however if you like this movie then you may be interested in a season in purgatory it is my belief that a season in purgatory is in fact a fictionalized account of the same crime anyway for me murder in greenwich is an 8 10,1
2418,this film is dreadful it has absolutely zero laughs hebrew hammer adam goldberg sets out to save from evil santa andy dick perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise while there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring this despite the fact that goldberg dick and greer hammer's client love interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite being played for what might be described as whacky over the top gags this film is consistently middle class middle of the road muck do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this note the music was good,0
2419,i expected fame to be an uplifting film but it ended up the opposite the overall plot which follows the lives of several determined students attending a performing arts school has strong potential however fame builds its characters up beautifully and then leaves us with so many questions when its over i was very surprised when the graduation scene pops up we thought the dvd had skipped or something all of the characters have internal and external conflicts of some sort and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends you might think there are too many characters but its probably too many scenes its evident the film was cut up and shortened because its sometimes lacks transition i think laura dean as lisa monroe is my favorite character i really connected with her character's ambition and following her heart boyd gaines as michael the stereotypical poor student who can't read but is a divine dancer is also very good i didn't especially like irene cara's character of coco but this is not cara's fault since her script is weak and her character is not fleshed out her voice is beautiful and hearing her songs warrants watching the whole film in summary the film could use many improvements but the quality actors and great music earn its place in film history,1
2420,another well done moral ambiguity pieces where the anti hero makes it hard to decide who to root for br br if nothing else the beguiled silenced anyone who said there were no good parts for actresses in movies at least in 1971 there were four excellent parts for actresses in this film and all were well cast and well executed br br pamelyn ferdin did a fine job as amy and would go on to play wanda june this must have been the first time an adult male box office star shared an extended kiss with a twelve year old girl on camera wonder if there was much controversy about this at the time it was probably polanski's favorite scene given the fate of amy's turtle randolph it is no surprise that ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist br br geraldine page was likewise excellent playing a complex character with just the right amount of restraint it is interesting that she died just three days after elizabeth hartman committed suicide throwing herself through a fifth floor window as they had also worked together in you're a big boy now br br hartman who looks like she could be blair brown's sister was wonderful as edwina and should have gotten an oscar no other performance was even close that year but given what we now know about her you wonder just how much of her performance was a studied effort and how much just came from inside her edwina shows such raw pain it is difficult to watch like marilyn monroe's incredible performance in the misfits the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing br br finally there is jo ann harris who is stunningly perfect as the flirty carol for my money harris was the sexiest actress of the 1970's combining sensuality with intelligence and humor she was the best reason to watch the most wanted television series and the only reason to watch wild wild west revisited hard to believe that someone who could bring all that to the screen never became a big star,1
2421,done in a mock documentary style late 60's subversives and supposed detractors of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice upon sentencing for their wrong doings there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern california desert at punishment park in the 100 degree heat the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an american flag for their freedom us and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter if the are captured it means prison br br appearing in this pseudo documentary carmen argenziano katherine mary ellen stan scott turner patrick boland and kent foreman,0
2422,i saw borderline several years ago on amc i've been looking for it ever since it was haunting visual textural sensual this movie took me somewhere like a dream and i didn't care where i will never forget the curtain blowing in the breeze i still remember the way it made me tilt my head i remember my facial expression when i saw it i didn't know what had happened when the movie was over but i find life is that way it didn't bother me the unfairness of the ultimate rejection of an innocent character strikes me as sadly real i loved the faces the way the camera dwelt upon them the camera gazed at the set with the unfocused eyes of a borderline was real to me in a way movies aren't it was exactly the lack of explanation color sharpness that made it enter my consciousness like a thief in the night i love this movie someday i will own it,1
2423,i rented this movie because the cover was cool looking the first 15 minutes of the movie are okay and somehow interesting but once the young woman and her little sister go on their trip everything goes to hell and the movie becomes boring,0
2424,black water is a movie that in a way surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations black water is truly a very well structured unpredictable thrilling well directed and well creepy movie the plot is actually somewhat original and will definitely keep you intrigued with it one thing i love about this movie is the direction because mainly on how it surpassed my original expectations my original expectations of black water was that it was a crappily made acted directed paced and boring movie it really wasn't well the acting is nothing to praise because there were times were i feel they didn't show enough emotions and there are some lines that feel just so scripted however i love the direction because all of it's shots seem predictable but arn't like when watching it say the camera gets a slow shot of the water and it goes quite you're like the croc's about to attack however the croc's attacks are very unpredictable which was bad for me who doesn't handle films like this all to greatly and this does make you jump plus i just love that it's one of those horror movies that don't rely on the sudden big sound blast to make you jump but instead the actual movie i also like how the story is about people who are trapped in these trees it made it seem very real and definitely kept your eyes on the screen i must say i didn't think the opening 20 so minutes were done well and i think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life plus i didn't like how they tried their absolute best to make the characters situation seem entirely hopeless when it really wasn't also again i just don't think some of the characters actions were realistic for example i wouldn't have gone anywhere near the water knowing their was a crocodile in it let alone a killer one however these problems really arn't that major and i was still able to enjoy the film overall as far as movies go i've seen better but as far as animal attack horror films a genre i get easily scarred at it's one of the better ones you'll see and sure it's not perfect but that doesn't mean it's not worth a shot,1
2425,the only complaint i heard about this film was that it was slow though perhaps this is the point the two characters clash and the slow build up of tension between them is anxiety producing the intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialog take the tension to a point where an otherwise normal argument shocks the audience istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy scenery captivating and the plot is thrilling not in that look the hero blew up yet another car and he's now flying with his motorcycle kind of way though i had chills down my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watched the fog engulf istanbul,1
2426,the cell 2000 rating 8 10 br br the cell like antz must be watched twice to be appreciated the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing i decided i had to rent it again i did and i found the film to be much more likeable the cell is not for everyone but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched the film's script can be clunky at times as can the acting but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed singh who has also directed music videos goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance overall the cell is a powerful disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great pleasurable watch,1
2427,this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended i was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for vendetta a phenomenal film after this debacle br br it's not bad in an entertaining way like showgirls it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out plot holes the size of planets the worst script in memory horrible acting by decent actors visuals that should be great but somehow flop br br it could have been so good,0
2428,from an artistic standpoint the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution the plot is hard to follow if there is one at all the acting is tough to stomach the dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn't know english only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie although you can still see flaws in the picture br br as an asian american female the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be politically speaking putting asian women in such disgraceful roles should be outlawed perpetuating stereotypes of asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self esteem of asian women but also to the country as a whole i feel for the lead actress who played maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role br br as americans please avoid this movie art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another not hold it back,0
2429,this is a catastrophe movie set in london starting multiple hurricane and tornadoes on scotland are displaced towards east downing england coast and later the south after several hours of heavy the london barrier above thames is short from running over and it paves the way for disaster then a colossal tidal wave travel relentless down east causing devastation and lives of millions of londoners are in danger at the center of the story is a tom a who tries to save london from the effects of giant wave trying to convince the authorities that the town dike was unsafe furthermore a marine engineer robert carlyle and his ex wife samantha they are trapped into the barrier and dropped to sea meantime the secret government agency hq ruled by nash joanne whalley under direct orders of deputy minister david suchet attempt to control many displaced and avoid more dead approximately 200 000 they have a little time to save london from total catastrophe br br perfectly acceptable drama disaster with alright acting magnificent tom as a who predicts catastrophe and excellent robert carlyle and as ex matrimony rekindling their love the movie packs impressive flood scenes brought to life by the breathtaking computer generator special effects better than the classic of the 70s such as inferno and similarly to and day after tomorrow' although isn't a clear denounce we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming which originates the ozone hole the motion picture is well directed by tony mitchell i would recommend this movie to people who like disaster movies another adaptations about floods are the following 1976 by earl bellamy with robert culp and barbara hershey rain 1998 ' directed by mikael with morgan freeman and christian slater ' flood a river's rampage 1979 ' directed by bruce pittman with richard thomas,1
2430,i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema in the past couple of years it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity hannibal was not an exception i wasn't expecting much when i went in to see the movie the book was ridiculous and the saying the book is always better than the movie did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison br br usually when i see a terrible movie i find myself more amused than anything else sadly though i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that hannibal is the movie was filmed with promise i guess it had anthony hopkins julianne moore and gary oldman and for directing there was ridley scott there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained it was pathetic the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it what's worse is that the book was even crazier and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included which is sad in the case of a movie where br br spoiler ahead br br ray liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces that scene more than any other made me want to cry because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level silence of the lambs was one of my favorite films of all time but hannibal was a two hour plus joke this movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie,0
2431,imagine if you will four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in st louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal if you watch this in the dark and late at night you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of blair witch project what is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough but seem to lack genuine personality it seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens this movie is excellent for when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is and,0
2432,this was a very funny fast paced movie i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others i'd just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know how do hk producers choose their subtitle translators i'm most curious please direct me br br again to return to review it is a really rollicking film with plenty of content subtleties reminiscent of the classics though full of slapstick reminiscent say of the mexican comedies of cantinflas br br the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes trying to get to characteristics rarely explored the director's entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a disarming way br br and i don't see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped,1
2433,i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive it took a lot of something i don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy an example of the acting is when paxton's character is upset the south vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the sand map it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic to make things worse i have no idea how i'm supposed to feel about he's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an vietnamese english teacher the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring i give it 4 stars out of 10,0
2434,poor jane austen this dog of a production does not do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice starting at the top poorly adapted the screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to come to think of it i don't know what she was trying for but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years couple that with all the over acting and awful production values this is one adaptation that should never have happened it would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity do yourself a favor read the book it is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production,0
2435,a heist film with jean reno matt damon and laurence fishburne sounds great on paper i suspect it must have done when someone green lighted the production of this movie but the end product is terrible br br the story is dull the action boring and for a film that is only 88 minutes it seems to just drag on i could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better i should have been doing any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps br br sigh i'm a huge fan of jean reno but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this there are so many other great action movies around go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten,0
2436,black water is one of the most tense films i have viewed in a long time the story moves fast as it follows three tourists all great actors into a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat soon after dropping anchor in a remote area of the swamp they are flipped over by something huge in the water br br hastily the three manage to make it into a tall tree nearby as they realize that a crocodile has attacked them throughout the next two days they have to desperately try to escape from the crocodile's evil watchful eye and he doesn't seem to want to go away the movie drags just a tad bit but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget it's so much better than primeval and other recent crocodile underwater predator thrillers the tension is heavy and all three leads give terrific performances truly chilling this movie struck a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me apparently based on true events,1
2437,it came as no surprise to me that this was a very depressing and draining movie after all it's all about the impact of war on civilians and it's by the king of depression ingmar bergman in other words so many of bergman's works delve deep into human misery and angst and so this movie seems not so extraordinary coming from this director br br even though it is more difficult to watch the last half of the movie offers perhaps more insight into the lower depths of humanity that's because initially the main characters liv ullman and max von sydow try to overcome adversity and are basically decent though a bit stupid people however as deprivation after deprivation occurs they especially von sydow become less and less humane and more animalistic doing anything in order to survive br br fun to watch no freaking way but an interesting insight into human nature br br ps 1 thing i loved about this film is that it avoided a stupid movie chiche when the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or wine they finished the wine completely in most movies they barely touch their drinks or leave them untouched it drives me crazy as i would never leave a 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tasted terrible or had a bug floating in it bravo,1
2438,i love john's work as a singer but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view br br i thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part when he says your having an affair with the ol' man to his co star i kinda chuckled at his facial movements or lack thereof br br i would suggest the movie if you like john's music but not as a saturday night video br br if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much br br so so at best,0
2439,a brutally straightforward tale of murder and capital punishment by the state so painfully slow and accurate in the description of capital punishment from the preparation of the to the victim p ing in his own pants before dying it has the power to change your mind about death penalty the whole originated from this story the screenwriter was the powerless lawyer unsuccessfully trying to defend and then console the accused,1
2440,jess franco makes exploitation films and he has made tons of them franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history and god bless him for it unfortunately the diamonds of is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards br br exploitation films should be judged on story sex and gore what else is there this film fails on most of those benchmarks the plot is paper thin placing a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals we really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place as expected her father is the big white chief and she becomes a goddess sitting in trees naked add fortune hunters and precious stones and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line the characters are stock not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings br br gore none or at least very little this film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic italian cannibal movies those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way save for one cheap be heading this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts br br as best i can tell the only reason this movie exists is so katja mess and mari carmen could run around naked actually lita mari carmen does the full frontal heavy lifting while the two jungle ladies are bare chested throughout yes there are love scenes probably the most sterile franco has ever supervised the women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either br br this movie just reeks of low budget buffoonery the sets are laughable the acting is horrid and the editing is confusing there is no real story to hold this together and not enough of a budget or effort to shock or titillate i think franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation,0
2441,i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie probably i expected too much happening in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course but there is just nothing going on in here luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb numb faces started to kill me and that was very often it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly stroke pigs and french kiss men not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex if only it made any sense the whole murder situation is ridiculous seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer and that makes no sence either despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an unexplainable way maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it,0
2442,this movie was supposedly based on a non fiction book i'm not sure what book the script writer s read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances in italy instead it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men note the following examples br br br br spoiler details br br br br bash number one lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce br br bash number two lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the street br br bash number three lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen she falls for him after an afternoon of love making she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her br br bash number four you have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by sp fertilization i am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role in the movie after the female has been made pregnant the male lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it br br in conclusion this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on,0
2443,the next karate kid in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick i thought that eric chris conrad and julie hilary swank looked good in their prom attire to me ned michael was a real bully this was because he got julie in trouble with principal wilkes eugene boles if you ask me colonel dugan michael ironside was a pure a this was because he was a very harsh man who wouldn't tolerate mistakes my favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between julie and the alpha elite in conclusion i highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martial arts flicks or are fans of hilary swank,1
2444,i became a fan of the tv series homicide life on the street' late in the show's run but became a fan very quickly it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras taking the viewer everywhere with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface br br homicide the movie the reunion follow up to the series is as good as a made for television film can be after lt giardello yaphet kotto now a candidate for mayor of baltimore is shot the series' cast members are back to help find the killer in addition the cast members who left the force and those who died also manage to have their place in the film the intensity and fire that marked the series return and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series all in all a terrific tv movie br br vote 9,1
2445,as a long time resident of western pa i have an intimate knowledge of this topic and found it to be so authentically captured on film kudos to the producers of this epic and what a great legacy to the school children for years to come br br the attention to detail and realistic depiction of this complicated web of events make it a one of a kind production br br viewers will find themselves mesmerized by the storyline and captivated by the storytelling br br grahame greene is magnificent as the presenter br br bravo,1
2446,apparently the writer and director of this direct to dvd slasher movie is a fan of friday 13th and other summer camp slashers this movie has everything a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called camp blood the old man who warns them not to go there and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all the whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable special effects but instead the special effects are poorly done the killer walks around as if he's out on a sunday afternoon stroll and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning other than that dull and forgettable jasper p morgan,0
2447,when the movie begins it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are although oliver hardy is enormous it is stanley that looks like death warmed over apparently he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man additionally as i watched the film i was shocked how many pratfalls stan took i half expected his to drop dead from the exertion i really can't understand why they came out of retirement considering their health especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film br br stanley inherits an island and a boat he and ollie are ready to leave when antoine a man is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island along the way they discover that giovanni has away but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island it seems like paradise and they are all very happy a bit later a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand br br unfortunately uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff eventually the mob decides to hang the four men and take over at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared br br i will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting however one thing it is not is funny and that is unforgivable for a laurel and hardy flick while not a bad film it certainly isn't a good one a sad end to their brilliant careers br br all the actors except for the duo are dubbed into english as the movie was made in france while it may not be the very worst film they made this would be the big noise it sure is close watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident,0
2448,i'm shocked that all the hated it ratings are sixes and sevens still above average to me this seems a case of the emperor has no clothes i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's regardless it became a struggle to sit through and watch the dvd i saw did have some subtitles but about 75 of the speech is not subtitled some of it is hard to understand the jamaican patois was cool to hear but you struggle not to out' after awhile some of the shots were nice and the realism was there even if some of the performances were not great jimmy cliff did a good job the plot is not bad but quite predictable in the 1 43 film the highlights are jimmy cliff ivan singing for a scene and a couple of shoot outs and a fight probably 15 minutes or so the rest is pretty boring btw near the beginning of the film there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake which made me laugh for a bit one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there the ending was kind of interesting showing how the media from a young age influences people it could also be a general comment on the white man's influence on other main themes are poverty corruption church ambition in closing the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile the film much less,0
2449,what makes this documentary special from a film making perspective is its which engages the audience to in the delight of gypsy music it innovates the form of documentary while showcasing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of historically traveling peoples br br indeed the film itself is a single take of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the next br br watching this film one's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music rhythm and dance if there is a more deeply spiritual flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures it has yet to be filmed,1
2450,i have seen this movie about 4 times and every time i am impressed with the second camera assistant's work seems trivial but there is something very professional knowledgeable and talented there the movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments the significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago the acting is a bit strained but the work of the second camera assistant is stellar this person needs to get back into the business perhaps directing what is this person waiting for i will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines bob,1
2451,also titled the magical castle this one is a stretch why bother why create another and then add another story line that has nearly nothing to do with the play nor swan lake only some girlfriend of the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters not voices remain stripped to to its bares this is a continuation by a thread next thing you know some bird will have memorized the forbidden arts and swan princess 4 the magical bird will be born thankfully though the chapters are supposedly closed and this will beginning but bad ended trilogy will come to a close,0
2452,i am a massive fan of the log i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series though different was wonderfully dark and imaginative the thought of seeing tubbs edward and briss on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for yet somewhere it all went horribly wrong the writers had no story and no real ideas the part set in old england showed the glimmers of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film geoff provided the best of too few largely poor jokes and and briss's performances were big let downs if you love the league save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again and again a massive disappointment,0
2453,in 1937 darryl zanuck who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers was trying to get his newly created company 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at warners and the glitter palace at mgm this is my affair was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century san francisco in old chicago and in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily the plot is fascinating a trouble maker but heroic naval officer robert taylor is given a secret assignment by president mckinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing american finance he finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot barbara stanwyck and must decide between love and duty br br not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio film making the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt vonnegut for mother night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte and seems quite believable at least within the confides of studio make believe as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and this is my affair was no exception,1
2454,i am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case i'll make an exception the first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks this is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain save the day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him the lead actor gave the weakest performance and laurence fishburne or matt dillon couldn't even save this movie sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great this movie has none if you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest don't choose this one save your money,0
2455,i agree with the user that this episode is awful thr worst of the entire show now i'm not keen on many episodes of the later series but this one takes the biscuit it was unfunny and as for the ending i'm sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combined br br i mean the boys think they meant well but the ending was so upsetting that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits we see it has died could have saved the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they did br br there seem to be no outgoing message okay south park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an one such as make love not but this episode was just wrong avoid at all costs helen,0
2456,as many of today's movies are guilty of the plot isn't exactly stellar the movie doesn't move anyone and certainly this won't warrant any award outside of perhaps but then again who really cares br br eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny at times hilarious movie that i really enjoyed russo and shatner played their small parts well as well man i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has br br moving along this buddy cop flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out br br eddie murphy is at his usual top form and is downright enjoyable to watch de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly br br i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime br br top performance murphy hilarious enough said directing job nice nice action scenes used murphy and de niro together like a charm russo fed off in a nice supporting job br br my rating 7 out 10 it's not going to move you or anything but it's an extremely enjoyable movie br br it's showtime was a great success,1
2457,this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end the acting was bad the plot was worse and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class dennis weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part my advise don't watch this movie,0
2458,given christopher nolan's string of successful films it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature which is shot in black and white back in england running less than 70 minutes long done with little budget but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller br br though short the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the structure and characterization as told we follow a writer wannabe called bill jeremy who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner which at first could be conceived as research before he starts to make up his own rules and break them br br he meets up with charismatic cobb alex haw who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim's livelihood as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond lucy russell a mobster's moll who rejects his every advance br br told in a non linear fashion which comes with scenes that don't quite add up in the beginning this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more which gets duly delivered there are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo where loose ends begin to come together and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through br br it's also amazing how as a first feature shot on the cheap that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being with nolan involved in every stage of production from writing to shooting producing and directing having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends i guess here's an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there now i'll patiently wait for christopher nolan's inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease,1
2459,this brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself it is wooden and pedantic it has no saving grace whatsoever if someone invites you to his house to watch mr don't go even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within the whole plot is so bad that it could drive mother theresa to despair it wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor it was having to act in this clunker that did him in it must have haunted him the rest of his days perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the americans for his confinement he found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty,0
2460,i saw this last night at a screening for a marketing company it is and was a lot of fun to watch it held my attention all the way through and did not seem to lag at all i'd recommend watching it when it airs,1
2461,in reality that happened the royal mother in law and father in law with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public this troubled young elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue we must remember she was only 16 she was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life perhaps this began to appear as a trauma also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law as you say she kept all her children away from her critiqued her teeth and manners which she considered inappropriate for an empress and when sissi finally went to venice with her husband and children her eldest daughter died and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death she never recovered,0
2462,i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes unfortunately i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a popstar and you like high waisted jeans ankle socks and knee length skirts then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you,0
2463,i love juan piquer simón he's my absolute favorite bad movie director and throughout his whole career he incompetently tried to cash in on simply every successful contemporary trend in the horror and fantasy genres after the big hit that was superman j p made his own and hilarious supersonic man he picked in on the violent slasher movie madness with the insane pieces and he really over trumped himself with the return of e t the unofficial and downright laughable sequel to spielberg's sf blockbuster the rift is obviously inspired by the series of profitable underwater monster movies like the abyss and six from start to finish you can amuse yourself by spotting all the stolen ideas and shameless rip offs of these and other classics when a completely new and fancy type of submarine vanishes near the deep rift a second mission with u boat designer hayes on board is sent out to investigate what really happened to siren one in the dark depths of the ocean the rescue mission discovers an underwater cavern where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures the monsters are quite aggressive but there's also the danger of a government enemy among the crew members the rift is a forgettable film but it nevertheless has some ingenious  though very dodgy  monster models fans of blood and gore won't complain neither as the beastly attacks are quite gruesome and merciless the acting is very wooden although many of the cast names can definitely do better it's advisable that you simply enjoy the clichés and gory effects in the the rift because if you start contemplating about the screenplay you'll find that it makes absolutely no sense,0
2464,robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him this may work if you buy into the u s a number one mentality but story wise nothing much happens quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely it just doesn't pack enough emotional punch,0
2465,after a very disappointing part 3 i kinda wondered if i should even bother with the next karate kid while i could see why this saga wouldn't continue i still enjoyed the next karate kid most out of the second and the third karate kid movies while there are some very unrealistic moments and situations it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one br br hilary swank has this girl come far or what she plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when sort of babysits her per say he notices that she has karate skills he offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first karate kid but i would recommend this one i think you'll be pleasantly surprised br br 7 10,1
2466,sappy br br i liked how they went to the to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there br br probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job br br just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it do you like apples br br the guy nods or something br br well how'd ya like dem apples wow that is genius br br duh minnie driver would give her number to anybody robin williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf and there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason,0
2467,despite the solid performance of penelope ann miller this movie was an awkward mess the lead character's american accent was ridiculous and he never seemed comfortable as a result there was no chemistry between the two actors and i'm still not sure what ann margaret was doing there,0
2468,after looking for this for months and then accidentally buying it cheap it was disappointing i heard about it on a dvd r site and it sounded crazy br br but no what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fu ing wasn't too bad but the rest of the movie was pretty awful and made the movie seem really really long much longer then it's 85 minute runtime br br on a positive note the ape was funny for a couple of seconds especially when i think they took the only close up of it's face from another movie and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said which singlehandedly made all black people look like complete simpletons br br but it wasn't enough sadly br br 4 10,0
2469,ohhhh man this movie is awful br br this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name or no name well to be fair i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad name br br next to the characters there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie it's like a drunken snail making its way to die br br thank goodness melanie is nice to look at she's the only thing that kept me watching unfortunately the rest of the movie kept interrupting br br good for a laugh though if you're having a bad canadian movie night though br br did i mention melanie the only good point too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time br br another addition in the canadian hall of stinking movies,0
2470,this is a film about a six year old child from a village in maharashtra a state in india and his grandfather who come to a city in maharashtra to treat the child's eyes here the grandfather gets to know that the child has cancer in both eyes and that they have to be removed to save the child's life the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation br br the movie is not a typical cliché indian movie so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama this ia a supremely crafted sensitive movie which resorts to silent expressions rather than over the top dialogs to get the point thru witness the scene where the grandfather is told about the need to remove the child's eyes the acting is superb dialogs heart breaking your heart goes out for the grandfather who has the unenviable task of telling the child and his mother about the operation br br the handling of the subject has been excellent the film was made under great hardship by the director sawant who had to knock many doors to gather the rs six million approx budget even then the final product seems polished and has decent production values also witness the subtle city village contrast shown by the director by incorporating some random shots of the boy's life in the village sawant definitely seems to prefer village life br br the acting by all is excellent as the social worker is competent adding the required humane touch to her role kulkarni as the is great showing perfect mannerisms of a doctor as the child is a natural he doesn't seem to be acting everything about him is natural and does not seem forced br br but towering above all is as the grandfather he is astounding in his role mere words cannot describe his work it is a performance to cherish forever br br is a sincere effort to make good cinema it should not be ignored just for the fact that it shows that if things are kept simple the the results can be really surprising 10 10,1
2471,sorry randy i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a 'golden egg br br the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent br br there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take offs of other films jaws and european vacation to name but two br br if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation but much better br br i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d'angelo were approached to make this sequel if so they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down br br in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies br br randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead,0
2472,blame guy ritchie the late 90s success of ritchie's cliché ridden lock stock and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered sadly rise of the the true story of essex hardnut carlton leach isn't likely to reverse that trend despite a decent lead performance from hartnett the film falls victim to all too familiar east end stereotypes they're either busy blowing someone's brains out or shagging a scantily clad blonde br br from fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties charts rise through the ranks of thuggery leaving the for nightclubs leach becomes a bouncer where he's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders pat tate fairbrass and tony tucker stone and begins to realise gang warfare ain't what it's cracked up to be br br there is fun to be had deconstructing writer director julian laughable join the dots patois as every sentence seems to start with an 'i'm gonna or 'you or on occasion 'so then i only went an' typically concluded with a mandatory ' the direction too smacks of sadism especially the obvious glee gets from filming violent scenes in close up and in the case of the bloody shotgun to the face denouement in br br director use of the classic rise and fall gangster narrative isn't what will condemn to big screen obscurity nor is it the fact that half way through the film annoyingly sidelines leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of tate and tucker it's sickening appetite for scatter shot violence that ruins the film whether it's a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train it's all unnecessarily prolonged doesn't so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly robs you of two hours of your life you won't get back,0
2473,this unintentionally amusing mid 80s tv movie is based on the premise that sex bomb donna mills in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout is a neglected housewife pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader she escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband james brolin br br there are many laughable aspects to this film mills' first foray into co producing later following her departure from knots landing she found great success as a trashy tv movie queen starring in mostly issue of the week melodramas through most of the '90s she usually played a victim of some sort clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining she played for so long on knots funniest are the drawn out fantasy sequences filmed as though they are meant to be soft core porn wind and smoke machines backlighting porno music but as this is a network tv movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all the most amusing and bizarre scene has mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky haired punks complete with robert palmer soundtrack br br less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter pity poor cicely tyson as the mandatory psycho analyst or veronica cartwright as the mandatory best friend or even pre babs james brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger br br of course as in all of these sorts of films we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho therapy and then the film just becomes silly as we explore briefly the reasons for mills' shocking behaviour as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag br br vacuous,0
2474,compared to battle of britain this is a real film with real characters and a real plot battle of britain is basically a documentary with the occasional lawrence olivier and michael caine but the real protagonists are the spits the hurricanes etc here on the other hand you have two well wrought characters actually three and a real plot i strongly recommend it to anybody even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies it's well filmed and i wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him and i do not think that it's over sentimental it's only that in the fighters you have real people with real feelings and a real life as real as any fictional life in any great film,1
2475,this movie is bad i saw the rated and the unrated versions they are terrible now i know it's suppose to be a low budget porn spoof of spiderman but spiderbabe is just not good at being bad good it's not funny not funny at all i wanted to laugh i tried to laugh but this movie let me down at least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to and is it me because mundae is not a great looking woman from the waist down she's okay but on the way up leaves much to be desired she does look good in that school girl outfit please if you must watch this spiderbabe rent it first rated or unrated doesn't really make any difference they're both bad to me,0
2476,if someone had nudged me about 15 minutes into and asked what i thought of jamie foxx in the title role it would have been time for a blank stare after all what is this fictitious person talking' about that wasn't jamie foxx up on the big screen that was ray charles this is one of the best performances by anybody in recent years like the soundtrack jamie as ray is flat out brilliant br br the blind genius of soul who took a revolutionary step of mixing gospel with r b died during production the movie about his troubled life is good not great taylor direction and james l white's script follow the well worn biopic outline super talented youngster battles adversity achieves greatness while also self destructing then picks himself up out of the gutter for a happy ending the film shows charles' flaws heroin abuse chronic womanizing persistent bastard fathering even as it sucks you in with his beautiful music br br kerry washington and regina king play the main women in ray's life one his long suffering wife and the other his longtime mistress both actresses match foxx stride for stride what takes him to a different level though is his deep understanding and uncanny impersonation of the great musician the entire cast is effective especially sharon warren as his headstrong mother and curtis armstrong as a music exec stars are likely to be rewarded with trophies and better yet more starring roles br br i was not a ray charles aficionado before apparently the film has left out a lot as do all biopics but this picture functions as both an old fashioned crowd pleaser and a dark investigation of a brilliant troubled man for those who whine that foxx doesn't actually sing as if that somehow diminishes his performance take a hike no mere actor can sing like mr charles anyway you can't have everything what the talented star does in this picture is about as close to everything as we'll probably see for a while,1
2477,i've never read a good review for vanity fair and i can't understand why for something that was rushed through in ten days it all comes off surprisingly well though admittedly becky sharp is a better movie and miriam hopkins a better becky there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9 10 at times myrna loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees meow the move to a more modern setting did not work against vanity fair and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting barbara kent amelia was under 5 feet in height and few of the leading men were very tall either this all coming together to make loy look like an absolute amazon woman br br vanity fair is similar to craig's wife in that no matter how bad the main character is you have to love her and you know she deserves her comeuppance and then some but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it though based on the same story as becky sharp this version had a different ending which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical for pleasure value the ending of becky sharp is ultimately more enjoyable although aesthetically and from the flow of the story there is no doubt that the ending of vanity fair is the better one whether or not you actually like it,1
2478,i went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least half intelligent story i was extremely disappointed as it did not the plot and the decisions by the main character were so far fetched i was hoping for a dog day afternoon type movie but instead got something totally unacceptable i actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't heist movies are to be feel good flicks and this one tried to be just that every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie i found myself saying no way without giving the whole story away it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out and whose house was going into foreclosure he was invited in on a heist and accepted only to back down once the action began weak,0
2479,it's a deeply stupid humor but i loved it jean is a great actor in this movie is cute it makes fun of all the secret agents like james bond refreshing it's probably the most hilarious movie i've ever seen i already saw it three times and i still want to see it again buy the dvd as soon as you can you won't regret it it's the kind of movie in which you don't need to have a great scenario because it's a parody the only defect is that oss 117 is too short it's a jewel it's not really frequent to see a french movie get success in the usa but i think that this one has everything to succeed trust me,1
2480,people seem to be expecting citizen kane here the planet is a b monster movie and as such is good fun and different enough to be enjoyed the director clearly has something to offer not so sure about some of the cast as for the effects ain't a lot of effects budget i for one would happily recommend this outing to a sci fi head or anyone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously if so watch blue instead i noticed one review saying it had ripped off alien like alien didn't rip things off the best thing about the film the director the worst thing about the film the cast maybe it's time for the director to move from glasgow to london and find some talent in the meantime well done at least you're trying to do something,1
2481,the 08th ms team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict the zeon officer and shiro the federal new pilot meet in a battle in space throughout the 12 episode series and one movie the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them it features a romeo and juliet romance and unbeatable animation by far one of the best to hit american shores suit up,1
2482,any person claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it otherwise i can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title br br the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable instead of casting franco nero as the ninja they could hire some experienced martial artist instead in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar his kicks and punches are lame br br there's enough of old action movies with good action this is just a waste of time,0
2483,if i had to decide which was the best ernest movie and don't act like that sort of thing doesn't happen all time it would be this one br br all of the ernest movies are entertaining but the best ones are the ones that have jim varney doing a number of different characters additionally i am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of bill and gailard sartain as brothers chuck and bobby tulip ernest goes to jail contains all of those elements as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved character actors br br and that is why i have chosen ernest goes to jail as the king of all ernest movies disagree with me if you must but deep down you know i am right,1
2484,this a wonderful sequel to the award winning lonesome dove miniseries in the 1980's this sequel is perhaps better than the original it is definitely more family friendly the language is more subdued there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome however overall a great movie the acting is superb william peterson is fantastic such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing jon voight aptly fills tommy lee jones' shoes as captain call ricky gives a great heart filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him highly recommended,1
2485,i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works e g linda grant's when i lived in modern times usually from the israeli side of the fence also a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year so with such a recommendation br br however i actually found myself nodding off at points admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes i went with it but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film i liked the concept of a restrained almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments the sexy girl the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter but personally i think the film has been over hyped i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything it's definitely not but even a little more dialogue would have helped,0
2486,i was surprised by how great black snake moan turned out to be being a fan of christina ricci and samuel l jackson id figure id give this a try well when this was over i was just left stunned by how great this film truly was i mean everything was dead on great and very accurate for that matter this film shows how the great director and writer craig brewer who made hustle flow another great film can just take anything even something that seems and make it into this well i like how it is just a good time like its a film that just makes it there own in a good way also i love that it doesn't show big of the south and how its been portrayed in things as the most repulsive place to be but not this film it makes very accurate and because of that very the in this was just phenomenal especially from christina ricci who deserves an oscar for this role the always great samuel l jackson and even justin timberlake did a great job as well overall almost everything is great about this and while its not everyones type of film its definitely worth a viewing from anyone who can enjoy a good time three cheers for black snake moan br br 9 3 out of 10 stars,1
2487,shopping sunny skies beaches boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent it's confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism when kristin the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season left the show all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection very many people will have to lower their standards with hope they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing jamie lynn spears is useless for acting singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career there is no wondering why she is a self proclaimed actress critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that,0
2488,good drama comedy with two good performances from hunter hurt but albert brooks steals every scene he is in with a great script this movie soars and gives everyone a chance to show their acting talent and although joan cusack is not in this much but she has one if not the funniest scene in the movie the highlight of the movie for me was albert brooks speech on the devil only one draw back is the fact it goes little slow in places and i only got totally interested in brooks role not so much in hunter's or hurt's i give this a 7 out of 10,1
2489,this is an old dark house movie a young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by satan where they run from and into one after another of an ill assorted crew a lady in distress an ape an ape man a midget various odd looking people and for some reason two chinese they end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a price is right sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints hence the title for my taste it's too much of the same thing the creeping around fun house corridors is amusing for a while then becomes repetitive by comparison with harold lloyd or buster keaton or laurel and hardy doing the same bit in two reels it isn't truly funny it's not frightening either and apparently wasn't intended to be the household is too absurd most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat and usually two one that the characters are led to believe is real and another for which it's a cover here the cover isn't to be taken seriously and neither is what covered a few moments of fun emerge from the mix but it's rather heavy fun the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect and still could be,0
2490,based on the book space vampires by colin wilson this is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of sci fi horror to come out of the eighties the effects done by ilm still hold up by todays standards the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism br br the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for it's low but for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well paced plot br br not to be over looked,1
2491,this was really one of the most enjoyable specials that i have seen on tv he is just an incredible performer his personality shines through in each one of the songs that he does i really wish this was available as an uncut dvd so i could watch it over and over without the beeps for explicit language i have not had the chance to see him live but that is something that i really want to do now i can't forget his backup singers they really added a lot of substance and humor to the show with their campy style and flamboyant dance moves they really complement the true talent of dan i wish there were some more of the songs that are on his live cd which is also incredible it is refreshing to see someone like him perform just so incredibly personable and real i really can't say enough good things about dan and this show once again i just wish this was available as an uncut dvd,1
2492,lame ridiculous and absurd my 6 year old son talked us into watching this rubbish tripe stereotypes and themes not appropriate for children the antithesis of the commercialism of christmas is not socialism it's jesus,0
2493,i expected it to be good after i'd seen some other superb moments and read much about it but this movie is brilliant clever very bright emotionally and perfect in all moments every movement is there for a reason everything fits so closely and true and honest this is the movie about the beauty and innocence about it's simplicity,1
2494,i've watched a number of and sub rosa extreme movies lately and have found a lot to like about them br br this movie seemed a lot more slight than all the others i've seen perhaps that's because this is a comedy horror movie rather than straight horror and perhaps it's also because the humor didn't register with me very well br br it's a little less than seventy minutes long and the credits begin as the last ten minutes are beginning there are some outtakes goofs and behind the scenes stuff going on while those credits roll br br movies do tend to be short and tend to feel padded out in spite of that this is no exception with some scenes that tend to go on too long br br the story involves a poor kid in california who'd been picked on by all his classmates he'd had one shoe stolen and unable to replace it he was dubbed due to an obsession with pirates his parents gave him an eyepatch for christmas with a christmas tree emblazoned on the eyepatch br br many of the classmates are killed and the few who remain gather together to decide what to do they're picked off one by one by who stalks around to the sound of sleigh bells ringing br br the characters are pretty much all broad stereotypes like the nerd named etc there's an odd scene in which a kinky couple has sex the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded the man wears a large paper watermelon slice over his head this reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from director rinse dream br br the picture quality is good and there are a lot of extras but basically a pretty silly movie br br oh well i guess you can never have too many christmas horror movies still there are a lot of other needy holidays,0
2495,and nothing wrong in that heartily endorse the comments of and snow leopard br br i'm thrilled to find this movie is available on us dvd i've only ever seen it through once i persuaded the goethe institute here in london to show it in their conrad veidt season some years ago and long to see it again br br barrymore is resplendent when engaged as in this movie possibly because of the prick of having a renowned german actor as a foil and veidt is such a wonderful scene stealer doesn't he pick his nose at one point this is one of the seminal films to connect 'dr with century' 'grand hotel' or and 'the cabinet of dr or 'the student of prague' with 'the spy in and 'casablanca' br br see it,1
2496,is a cinematic survey of gypsy music from several countries it is touching sad and joyous most of the segments appear to be completely unrehearsed the music ranging from the sensual flamenco music of the spanish gypsies to the melancholy music of the central european gypsies is exquisite if you love gypsy music you'll find absolutely beautiful br br,1
2497,visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made for tv quality the romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized perhaps a nice under the blanket on a cold night freebie on cable but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful though,0
2498,filmed less than a year after the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the subject matter was fresh in the minds of the cast the director and the audience most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war the soviet army cooperated quite a bit during filming which is odd br br the afghan intervention was a bloody and pointless war in which even the generals had forgotten the reasons for the bloodshed this film shows the tension and the cruelty of military life the emotional atrophy experienced by the troops and the pain that convulsed a small nation torn by war and civil war br br there is no lack of powerful scenes one of the first is footage of steel coffins being loaded onto a transport bound for the ussr solders go about their work while an officer calmly ticks off the destinations moscow rostov the baltic br br an earlier comment describes the last scene with as illogical it is perfectly logical and in the spirit of the film the only human relationship maintained was with the afghan family which he accidentally kills in the assault having lost his only buffer against the senselessness of the war turns his back on the boy and his gun in resignation to his fate br br i particularly liked the last scene a flock of mi rising over the mountains as the voice of a pilot yells we're leaving boys we're leaving in a tone of sincere relief br br is an excellent film brutally honest and as as they come,1
2499,this is one of those movies that has everything in it i don't think i would get tired of seeing it hopefully more movies like this one will be made in the future the casting was perfect in all respects in a sense the song sung by engelbert humperdink i never got to say goodbye is the song come to life you will most definitely laugh and cry throughout the entire scenario for sure i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend i think that it's positively worth seeing and your heart will be glowing it would be nice to cuddle up with your honey sip a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other there is so much heart and emotion at times you honestly don't know where to turn you will know exactly how the character feels true family expression is available all the way through in fact at times you'll even think you are part of that family or they a part of yours see it,1
2500,this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the between required public life and the need for privacy robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation he sends him to england to negotiate a deal where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it he comes back handed having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive it could have been gritter nastier and less romantic the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics br br somehow the costume design was nominated undeservedly for an oscar it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively studio politics at work yet again no doubt br br what is however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent this if anything deserved the oscar nom it was mgm's first film in b w br br not as good as it could have been but not terrible either,0
2501,one of the worst movies i've ever seen when i was trying to watch this i had flu and i was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment unfortunately this was too much how so many totally ungifted actors can be in one movie this movie makes porn look like european art movie cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions special thanks to charlie baldwin soon to be ex wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather just horrible and funny br br with lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs just like ed wood movies the plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some cheeky soap opera br br hopefully nobody paid to see this movie br br,0
2502,war is in your blood rambo says early in the film don't fight it say what is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here yet stallone utters it without a hint of irony br br the same lack of humour applies to the movie rambo iv is an over the top idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous it is not enough just to kill them  you have to dismember them with relish stallone stops at no blue collar cliché to make his point it is not enough for the chief villain to be feed them to the pigs throw babies into fire kind of sadist he is also a pedophile homosexual br br what is happening to imdb is it taken over by the rifle society how can this loathsome excuse for gross exploitation rate that high i like a good action movie as much as the next man but this is not entertainment  this is pornography of violence that trivializes and ultimately denigrates the real tragedy of the only good thing about the movie is that sly doesn't take his shirt off for this i will give it one star,0
2503,i think south park is hilarious and i have no problem w them taking shots at people on the left but you'd think that after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war and then being gasp right along they would have the sense to start giving w and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is br br gore is fair game but please what do the republicans have to do how bad do they have to f k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can and that they have done some true screwing up or maybe just go after rush limbaugh hes a good target or even just make fun of condoleeza rice's gap teeth,0
2504,where do i begin walt disney's happiest motion picture lady and the tramp is one of if not possibly my favourite in the theatrical canon of disney animation the sequel however is to say the very least enjoyable i enjoyed myself throughout the whole movie it was flame shield up adorable the broadway style of the songs and the movie kind of worked and i was humming the songs for the rest of the night i can if you asked me to still sing all of the songs br br but where the movie was really good for me it was bad in a lot of other places the animation was kind of scary at times every time there was a close up shot of someones face i don't know it just seemed scary to me also where the hell was lady she gets like two lines of dialogue and only doggy hugs scamp at the end she gets 0 interaction with the plot and her only son br br but all in all i liked it compared to the original does it hold up no the songs aren't as good still kind of catchy though the plot was a lot less involved lady had almost nothing to do with it and it's not as cute as the first one but if you go in with an open mind you'll have fun and maybe ' like it,1
2505,this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p town 2001 before it was curiously enough banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort the codes which resulted in its closing have since been i saw it again later in the off broadway long running production in new york oddly enough the p town production was far better than the new york one fresher cuter more spirited and funnier but that was only in the 2001 showing subsequent attempts to clone the production bare naked lads in 2007 were definitely third rate this filmed production features a los angelos production cast and it is as other comments have suggested not the best i would rate it somewhere in between the top notch 2001 p town production and the third rate bare naked lads p town show from last summer,0
2506,i think this is the worst movie i have seen since mortal kombat 2 the action including the effects is like in a cheap glen a larson tv show the acting is terrible and the dialogs are even more stupid than in mk2 avoid at all cost,0
2507,i feel privileged to have accidentally seen this movie i actually ran across this movie by accident i was taping another movie on showtime one night overnight and this movie came on afterward so i sat and watched it and boy was i blown away the acting is absolutely superb kathy bates who has been my favorite actress since misery and fried green tomatoes gave an amazing performance as a domineering mother who tries desperately to hold on to her old school values religion family at the risk of alienating her family martin sheen is superb as the tough patriarch who is really not in control of anything in his life or family the one thing i really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home it shows the true damage that is done to our soldiers after they fight pointless wars for political and financial gain this movie just blew me away and i feel blessed to have accidentally taped this movie and seen it this is a must see for anyone who wants a true drama this is not too melodramatic and preachy but pulls at your heartstrings like none other,1
2508,this is unfortunately carlin's last recorded hbo concert from a series that lasted over 30 years though this may not be his best work it is excellent funny and thought provoking this recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts that it is a bit than most of his other concerts br br throughout his long prolific and influential career carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fart jokes towards a more viewpoint of society and culture his focus on the english language and euphemisms increased throughout the years and culminates in this performance though i would argue that his audio book when will jesus bring the pork chops best displays his vast wit with regards to language euphemisms and the breakdown of our values it's bad for ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to a writer br br if you are offended by foul language or the disparagement of the church you will probably not like any of carlin's stand up material however if you enjoy being mentally stimulated and can tolerate the language and blasphemy you would probably greatly enjoy this concert,1
2509,this is probably the second best of the death wish movies death wish 5 is the best one br br death wish 3 reminds me of west side story with a new twist not even the recent flick gangs of new york can measure up with one new york neighborhood in death wish 3 which is plagued not by two rival gangs but one big gang a gang that is willing to do things like cutting a person to death with an ax if he trespasses on its set br br deborah raffin who plays a public defender plays gently in this action packed movie that is filled with a lot of shoot em up violence so like nichols in death wish ii death wish iii scores with its gentle romantic moments as well as its violent moments only the james bond love interest scenes would do much better br br and in addition to his 38 plays with this new gun called the 475 magnum it reminded me of the dirty harry movies when callahan used his 44 magnum in magnum force sudden impact and dirty harry the gun packs a big punch and when kills with it he doesn't care if the gun has a big kick in it br br and that missile that killed off the main gang leader well that is something would not use an missile as his regular vigilante weapon that is way too military for him,1
2510,i saw on a night i couldn't sleep and i was never so glad to have insomnia this story of a young white teacher who takes a position teaching poor black kids on an island in the is a great advertisement for teaching and for simply helping each other set in the early 60s with the civil rights issues viet nam and all that came with the 60s it is forgotten that the peace corps and many young people struck out to make a difference helping the with his open style of teaching is interested in these kids as people and encourages an honest interaction in his class that scares the power's that be the greatest part was that jon voight said they had a 20 year reunion and 18 of those kids became teachers its enough to make you think we as humans may have a chance to survive ourselves maybe hopefully see this film,1
2511,well i like patricia she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming of this film she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious problem however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels the other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion there are some nice shots in the film you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all it really is a pity really shines in this film,0
2512,this is more than a sat afternoon special well written if very low key there is a lot here if you look for it catch the cat companion scout for instance it not only could have been a comic book it should have been a comic book the comic industry as well as the film's publicists missed the boat on this one of the least know really great films a great script by john sayles is a strong point but the acting is good as well probably the best super hero film i've ever seen short on special effects but long on believability this one's a keeper i have never seen a dvd of this film but i used to own a vhs version good hunting,1
2513,i have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunner br br an american werewolf in london that film had it's funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else this updated version now set in paris does not have that edge at all and simply isn't in the same class but it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall it's still fun to watch br br so werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the london version i'll still give it decent marks since i don't care what others think i liked it even though i agree london is better and i prefer that version too br br the first 30 40 minutes of this movie is strictly played for laughs including a hysterical scene with a balloon in a restaurant it also introduces the lead female character played by julie delpy i don't see enough of this actress she doesn't seem to make that many films or least ones i hear about over here in america this french actress has a face that is classic beauty so the film got points for having her in it and she looks great br br when the horror starts it can get scary and the special effects are good i also liked the lack of profanity in this film unlike the first one no f words and no lord's name in vain amazing br br however there are plenty of sexual remarks and there is one scene with a guy running out of bar tied to a cross which was blasphemous to me the soundtrack is heavy metal which isn't appealing to a middle aged guy like me either this film is geared a lot more toward 20 somethings if that helps anyone br br it's entertaining just don't expect it to live up to the first film,1
2514,you know i always fancy disturbing or strange movies especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg germany but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst film i saw this year will this comment contain any spoilers br br no because i just did not understand this movie but well what can you expect from a flick that was introduced to a festival crowd we the guys from the festival know that not all of you will watch this one until the very end br br i like splatter movies and i also like movies with a strong graphical language but this there are a lot of bloody scenes in this one but why what is the director trying to tell us is he saying that we lost all morality and all religious feelings or is he saying that incest will always end in a disaster who knows i do not br br if you want to watch a movie that keeps you thinking for quite some time watch it but don´t expect to think wow i got the message i did not get it,0
2515,meatballs has been a main staple in my family for over 26 years we saw this movie when it first came out and have seen it dozens of times since bill murray is at his best and is most touching in the scenes where he reaches out to a lonely pre teen boy and befriends him while leading his into once mischievous scheme after another the cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other this is not another sleazy dumb teen sex fest it is funny and sweet and just all around fun anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves it is a must see watch out for spaz he is by far the best character especially during the camp social while bill murray hams it up for the camera just watch spaz behind him dancing with the poor girl he picks to dance with by far one of my very favorite comedies of all time,1
2516,this is definitely a touching movie and a great expression of charles personal struggle the movie is not only about his struggle to get his book the origin of species published but also his relationship with his oldest daughter his daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views something that she as well had to pay for een more than him at times br br now this is not an evolutionary propaganda film as a matter of fact i think it managed to stay very neutral a hard thing to do in my opinion of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church quite the opposite actually if you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film it will be liked by and atheists alike but goes away from the movie talks about evolution and that's it br br paul bettany as charles darwin was incredible of course we all may think of darwin as that old man with the funny beard but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's early 30's jennifer connelly emma darwin is great as always but the actor who impressed me was martha west as annie darwin daughter definitely on of the best child actors of the decade the story is about darwin and his daughter and it is beautifully acted br br except for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing the production of this film is pretty flawless some scenes were darwin observes nature is just marvelous and is almost like taken out of a high production national geographic documentary br br i must admit though i'm not quite sure of why they chose creation as the title i doubt it is an irony the movie is too respectful for that well i'm sure there's a meaning too it just don't let it scare you away br br i give this movie a 9 10 this is truly a great tribute to charles darwin and please give it a chance,1
2517,this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work dean martin isn't bad and montgomery clift is quite good as well unfortunately it's a very disjointed very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours it's almost 3 hours br br we follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they're made of for some it's the women in their lives that brings about this realization for others it's the broader general circumstances all too often however i found myself asking what had just happened or what the import of a particular scene was,0
2518,this game is an action adventure with combat there are quite long periods with no combat but other times you have to get rid of various kinds of monsters the monsters are not like anything you would see in real life and they have to be gotten rid off in order to continue with your quest the whole game is a quest you play adam randall whose father contacts him from the beyond and asks him to come and save him the game is from the mid 1990's and has to be played in dos i used and was able to play the game quite well the graphics are not as good as some games even of the time mainly because the resolution is not high and some scenes look quite blocky but others look batter but don't let that put you off the game the game is very imaginative its long and can make you jump when unexpected monsters appear out of nowhere not for young kids who likely wouldn't be interested anyway but over 13 or 14 might like this game its a horror mystery action adventure combat combination i thought it was a great game its had to find now maybe ebay but remember its a dos game and you would not be able to play it on todays faster computers would be hard to play on fast computers unless you use oh and the acting is very good too,1
2519,this has to be one of the most powerful message sending movies i saw lately it was absolutely flawless all the way amazingly original and thought provoking story is unusual and original and the characters make this story very very powerful it's about a guy who kills his ex girlfriend's retarded kid brother and as he is sent to juvenile prison through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don't let it go until the very end murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more it's a total tour de force cause those actions cannot be described by simple words his motive of committing murder is left explained and it makes viewers think acting was pretty much flawless and the cast was very good it contains many familiar faces if you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them e g 'mulholland dr ' then 'the united states of is an excellent movie choice for you otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for serious thought provoking movie br br 10 10,1
2520,mixing small town sheriffs high school students fake rock music and some weirdo who kills for well no reason in particular this film is essentially a re make of the giant gila monster except without the gila monster of course br br now anyone who has actually seen giant gila monster knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time frequently so slow it's not even funny and i can't believe that by 1967 giant gila monster had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel let alone a remake so will someone please explain to me why this film was made the dance sequence by the way is historically interesting although about three years out of date but even that's spoiled since it goes on and on and on,0
2521,i'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not so here it is the quick and the undead is a rip off of the quick and the dead i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it but oh no i was really in for an very big disappointment br br to put it simply the movie sucks i'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent br br but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm br br if you're a big fan of zombies watch this if you're not better look for other rob zombie films,0
2522,trading on the success of the 1975 hit this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where gets down with the slave women and the missus gets down with the big black stud and with son also in fact there is so much getting down going on that i really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed br br so if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes then this one is for you br br there is a funny sad story in here but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation,0
2523,this is a true feel good movie full of genuine sweetness and admirable people although the premise requires a significant suspension of disbelief it is worth the trouble to do so the director writers and actors truly convey what it feels like to be in love,1
2524,maybe the subject was good but put down to a script it fails in pace maybe the author was trying to obtain something slow paced like alien but instead of being haunting this movie turned out just boring technically good anyway a pity for the lack of tension,0
2525,this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue lyon of lolita movie fame and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she bolts out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one a total wasted effort,0
2526,i quite this anne rice book adaption while most of the film is filmed here in australia it offers a great amount of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot in lestat stuart townsend has recently woke up from a long period time of sleep and has decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band when he becomes a popular movie icon his fellow vampires go mad and plot his death meanwhile jesse marguerite moreau a orphaned member of the supernatural studies who has an ancient vampire family tree has become deeply obsessed with lestat her boss david paul mcgann understands her obsession and his obsession with the vampire marius vincent perez who is an ancient vampire and the man who made lestat a vampire too jesse is given diary and reads of his first killing and an encounter with the queen of the damned aaliyah when lestat holds a concert in death valley he receives news that not only will angry vampires be there may come as well meanwhile has other plans she goes to a vampire coven a bar and kills everyone in her path with lestat tempted with and loving care by the ancient vampires consisting of marius and aunt lena olin plot against them join her or die br br i thought the film was fantastic it had great fight scenes great music and great locations aaliyah sadly passed away in a plane crash shortly before the films premiere but she looked stunning on the set and off the sets br br i gave this film 10 10 because it was a fantastic film and i urge you to see it,1
2527,this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though i will concede that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director as it turned out this was not to be the case br br apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series i fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointing br br true it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in batman a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfying br br michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne with tycoon max schreck christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partner in crime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier's richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities br br there are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain to the script in some places which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four cornered fight there simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on br br nevertheless this is a damn good film i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton,1
2528,the problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a 6 hours movie into 2 hours the result is clear it seems too forced unclear and too simple minded br br the only plus side is the beginning it explains well why and how hercules was born the rest of the movie was just mumbo jumbo that is put together it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into 2 hours br br the acting is not very convincing either ok not all is bad but most of them are special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier although the 1st monster is pretty good overall i give it 4 out of ten for the reasons i described above,0
2529,opposing force 1986 wasn't as good as dr strangelove and it wasn't as good as the bridge on the river kwai heck it wasn't even as good as g i jane which is pretty sad br br the film revolves around a basic ethical problem in a simulated prisoner of war situation how far can you go before you start breaking the law what exactly is the law in such a situation how can you simulate the torture of someone without actually torturing someone can you intentionally inflict pain how about breaking bones mock executions sexual abuse severe blood loss real guns with bullets death somewhere between these is a really fuzzy line dividing acceptable from atrocious br br now what could you do if you found yourself in such a training program and the lines between simulation and reality begin to vanish what could you do this movie attempts to portray this dilemma br br i found it interesting to see the types of tactics used in resistance training i have a brother who went through the pow training program according to him it was pretty close to the mark technically br br the film has a fairly good premise but it doesn't have a particularly good story i wondered if it might be based on some actual event but it became pretty apparent that it wasn't when the explosions started they must have changed scriptwriters three quarters into the film because it takes a real extreme turn and devolves into a somewhat pointless shoot em up with lots of distracting explosions br br i found it to have a rather unsatisfying ending again kind of pointless i'm left wondering what the point of the whole thing was i'm beginning to suspect there simply wasn't one it could have been much better with just a little more story to go along with the fireworks,0
2530,i really can't see why people seem to dislike this film i found it very entertaining of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous laura fraser is a bonus when i first heard about it i thought it would be along the lines of a role reversed weird science and to an extent this is true however there is a twist which i really didn't see coming having seen the trailer on the dvd which i hadn't seen before watching the film i saw that the twist is actually shown in the trailer very strange br br as the film progresses the weird science comparison fits less and less and i think this is the better of the two films certainly there are some scenes which don't work wonderfully but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young cast br br in summary i'd suggest that this is a fine example of a sci fi chick flick and i don't think i've seen many of them,1
2531,this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on this has to be the worst football movie ever made this has to be one of the worst movies period the premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4 this movie isn't even a half a star bad acting scott bakula sinks as usual larry miller sinbad couldn't act if he tried rob schneider's one liners completely stunk fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower not even close a complete waste of time and of film if we could give a negative number minus 9,0

2533,this flick is strange but i liked it a lot its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away its weird yeah but different than other movies in a good way i think i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story but has lots of funny stuff too like get to see james franco in a wig i liked the notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story but the rest is way different nothing like that sienna miller is really good i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't know br br see it,1
2534,i love bad movies showgirls plan 9 from outerspace so on and this movie fits right in don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film it's downright awful tim accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark there are people hopping up and down mt as if there were escalators installed on it this thing is laughably ridiculous so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor it is totally implausible i loved every minute of it,0
2535,cates is insipid and unconvincing kline over acts as always as does lithgow while butchering an english accent at least i assume that's what he's attempting and the tone staggers uneasily between farcical and maudlin as with most pet projects showcasing a celebrity couple it's a relief when this shoddy piece grinds to it's forced and jarring conclusion,0
2536,this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it to make little like it which made it even stupider even some of the names were unrealistic the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned,0
2537,once in a while i like a good horror movie so i thought this would be a splatter and gore movie but it was a boring boring movie maybe because i have seen a cut version because there where only two things that where a little splatter one time where some ones cuts someone arm of and where some one shots an arm of but that where the only things for example had more cool then evil ed its more a boring ed than a evil ed and some actors where lousy to o,0
2538,while this film might not be the next evil dead hell who knows maybe it will it has only been out for a year it is worth a look don't expect a 10 million film cuz you'll be disappointed do expect to be entertain to laugh and to enjoy the experience all in all this film is much better than many if not all of the low budget horror films out there i have seen films that spent more than 10 or 20 times what this film cost to make and turned out times worse the effort that was put into this film far out weighs the set backs it faces by having a limited budget movies are meant to entertain and this movie sure does that in fact this film might even open up new doors for you in movie watching it's available on netflix if not your local video rental store so watch it then decide,1
2539,i love sarah and was worried about the tv adaptation as i'd been disappointed by the bbc's version of tipping the velvet which although beautiful to look at was let down by hawes not being able to sing and rachael stirling not being able to act is a very tightly plotted novel with breath taking twists and turns and i wondered if this could be done justice to in just 3 hours br br i needn't have worried the adaptation was excellent very little cut out and went along at a cracking pace although i did wonder whether if you hadn't read the book would you miss things it had the look and feel of a bbc classic costume drama and i kept having to remind myself that this is a contemporary book br br the acting was stellar sally hawkins acting her heart out as sue trinder and elaine cassidy a slow burner who by the end of the story was incandescent as maud lilley the love the passion the realisation of the acts of betrayal both would have to perform were written on their faces it was a joy to watch br br i hope rachael stirling was watching that's how you play a sarah waters character,1
2540,we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible,0
2541,i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film,1
2542,with anatomy the german film producers have tried to make something totally new usually there just drama or comedy movies in the horror genre is or was totally new at that time br br the story's also new and shocking franka potente plays her role brilliant and i bet you won't find out who's the murderer it's possible but difficult a really great movie with a lot of talented actors,1
2543,clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work the autobiographical henry character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's also starring faye dunaway anyone who has seen should certainly see to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood soaked rourke rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's a place setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting handsome relatively clean looking wanna be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of story dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er do well henry the women in can't hold a candle to dunaway's and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip off from br br if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film see and 'love is a dog from hell' which also goes by the title love',0
2544,i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time i have seen it well over 100 times actually had to buy a new copy as a result of it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again buy a copy now it is a classic,1
2545,i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag childish humor cheap looking sets cheap looking effects a plot that makes legally blonde look like the usual suspects and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996 the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves but there's where it ends ok so the guy decided to do something new for a change a children's spy movie well if i were 12 i'd feel insulted the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla that just stole every scene she was in sadly there weren't many 4 10,0
2546,while aeon flux was mildly entertaining and a slightly better way to spend a wednesday evening than the pub i did leave pleased that i had got buy one get one free tickets knowing nothing about the film as i went in in fact i didn't even know there was an animated series before i read this site i was ready for anything and as some other viewers noted the trailers showing a well filmed good looking and interesting piece of cinema had pulled me in half way through the film though i was kind of disappointed it did remind me of the fifth element but i too feel it just lacked the extra bit of depth and left me with the empty feeling and enough of the pointless and slightly boring gun fights if you're going to do them do it with some style not just loads of explosions and inept guards falling down personally i'd rather have seen a bit more about the story and the people in the city or got to know more about how the chairman was being undermined than yet another long and loud gun fight,0
2547,this movie features a pretty decent fx sequence of an earthquake for 1936 the reason you haven't seen it is because audiences in the 30s were enamored of the jeanette macdonald picture in which the eponymous star her way through countless songs while plots came to a complete standstill the fx cross time very well macdonald's songs do not and the awkward insertion of said songs to show off her only typical talent is not good br br the hoary device of two friends growing up to become a priest and a hoodlum is given another run through the machinery manhattan melodrama the departed at the 30 minute mark you've already heard the song francisco' three times entertainment in the thirties is generally an accumulation of irritation only grand hotel from the decade foregoes annoyance to the degree shown in san francisco dinner at 8 little caesar stagecoach all quiet on the western front les miserables etc,0
2548,to keep from being bored during love and sex first i tried to think of all the movies this was of breaking up with russell crowe and salma hayek though that had a more original ending about last night with rob lowe and a lot of tv shows br br second was admiring just how gorgeous janssen is so i couldn't believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date she is certainly in line to give julia roberts a run for her money literally and wasn't julia in some movie with this same plot or other br br third was trying to figure out why the writer director bothered to give jon character the jewish name of adam levy he even refers to eating a ham sandwich br br fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why i was in the theater br br originally written 9 2 2000,0
2549,rowan atkinson's mr bean ranks right up there with laurel hardy buster keaton the marx brothers and other comedy greats i have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when i introduced them to mr bean via my videos and now dvds i'll never forget the first time my brother saw him he was over for a visit and i asked him if he'd ever seen mr bean who he said so i got out my video and showed him the one where mr bean is in church and starts to nod off my brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard he became an instant fan of mr bean we all know how hilarious these episodes are but the fun is in sharing them with others i have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts favorite episodes are the visit of the queen the hotel room stay late for the dentist appointment the christmas episode a classic plus kids love it and the new year party rowan atkinson is a comic genius,1
2550,before seeing this picture i was quite skeptic i don't like movies with an agenda nor do i appreciate being scared into thinking like the writer i was also afraid this would be like the 2 part mini series 10 4 which had a far fetched concept little relation to the real world and very poor execution at the beginning is says this film is fiction but the events portrayed and the information about uk emergency planning are based on extensive research and the general feeling is that you're not being sold on an idea but that you're being taught a lesson in civil awareness the message that is being conveyed is obvious from the start it is coming and we're not prepared the use of real places and a scenario which not only could happen there are plans for when it does all add to the disturbing effect the movie will have on even the most cynical of viewers the movie's perspective is that of the society and it stays away from heart breaking personal moments which won't convey the message so none of the romeo juliet drama we're used to,1
2551,a bad movie but with one reel that is worth savoring for most of the film the jokes are bad the songs are bad even w c fields is bad then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie ex the dialogue is witty and the song a version of thanks for the memories light cynical and delightful who in for this one bit yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission,0
2552,i'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie the only woman who shows any balls unfortunate pun regretted is made to look talk and seem like a guy the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind sex being sexy with sex as their only attribute and skill iris or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose doc the only strength iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist i have to give the camera work props and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene after that his performance loses steam empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy at least the film skims the subject of the duality of good bad in the criminal mind,0
2553,this is a lame comedy br br here's why a man and wife sitcom okay br br the husband is a douche bag the wife is the einstein br br how original is that br br jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld br br the gags are lame no witty one liners br br i have had enough stop this now br br the last word stupid the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc the worst part kevin james is actually a funny comedian he just isn't here leah is great eye candy but is unlikeable wasted talent is the word bad sitcom,0
2554,this coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in new groove the character i liked most of all was so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel sp featuring non other than br br i just watched new groove it took me two days because i had to shut it off i was so bored halfway through it i finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first br br being a disney film i was expecting to have some musical scenes however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing the great thing i found about new groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience from toddlers to adults new groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first it is really aimed towards young children the comedy is pretty childish the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny br br save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing i was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was they actually managed to make a character not funny in this film that is amazing in itself br br obviously every ones opinion differs but i am very easily amused i usually enjoy sequels sp even when others discredit them mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film i cannot say the same for this one i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom br br buy at own risk,0
2555,seems like a pretty innocent choice at first the name employee of the month might ring bells with office space and the show office clerk i think not this isn't even a dark comedy the director of this movie whoever the guy's name was a complete jerk and has a sick perverse mind there is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife steals from his top notch job and lies through his teeth 24 7 the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it and believe me they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief perhaps even some fable in the end sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good no memorial was made br br this movie has borderline insanity it the elderly the dead and women and the director tries to make people to like it br br i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good but not even that was all that memorable if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters my friends do not do this at home,0
2556,it has to be said that this film is definitely one of the better bargain bin movies out there i'd feel a bit cheated if i had paid for it but at about £1 50 i felt that i definitely got more than my monies worth br br the film can't quite decide if it wants to be mad max or one of the clint eastwood man with no name spaghetti westerns and as such is stacked with clichés from both even the manic loony who hangs out with the bad guys in mad max is there br br that guy from blade runner also cops a good billing although he only turns up at the beginning and the end of the movie br br favourite bit for me the punch up on top of the oil refinery if you look closely you can see the post apocalyptic rush hour traffic thundering past in the distance as the two protagonists knock seven bells out of each other br br get several in a few pizzas and sit back and enjoy what is ultimately lightweight but entertaining drivel,1
2557,i don't know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers' aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation not give us a true portrait of the man himself in the movie besides a few racist remarks he's shown to be just another hard nosed old coot he's so full of life with a heart of gold more or less this is also the worst acting i've seen t l jones do he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character he just doesn't flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb robert wuhl didnt impress either the comedic elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all a bloody waste of time it is,0
2558,i guess this is the first movie that made me aware of the term cult flick it is totally a bad movie but i can't help it i like this movie richard boone has made better and so has joan van arc but if you are in to staying up late and watching movies that don't make you think to much this one is for you,1
2559,perhaps this movie is a little too long but it still has some charm 45 years later the main roles seem more appropriate for clark gable and vivien leigh i could care less about gary cooper but ingrid bergman is fine particularly in dark hair the movie is worth seeing for the supporting cast flora robson is terrific as a servant she is a white woman in blackface and can have an expression of evil or of a voodoo mistress jerry austin as a servant dwarf has a delightful role that keeps you chuckling despite some overlong scenes speaking of scenes florence bates steals most of the ones she is in as a dowager social lady i didn't understand the outcome of the railroad fight at the end of the movie and the last scene was pure hollywood dreck it's an odd feeling when you realize the film title refers to a railroad rather than a piece of luggage,1
2560,quite simply goldeneye is the single greatest n64 game to date the learning curve is just about perfect and you'll still be playing it with your friends months on as the multiplayer mode is nothing short of exceptional br br the system for acquiring cheats for once requires some degree of skill rather than simply knowing which buttons to press and the challenge of aztec on 00 agent level is astonishing br br all in all it's the best game i've ever played on the n64,1
2561,this film is a masterpiece it was exhilarating from beginning to end writer director paul thomas anderson's story about a porn star is told with style grace humor even poignancy the actors and the characters they play are all first rate including mark wahlberg in the lead who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film burt reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers wahlberg the film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead on accuracy from the disco scene that begins the film to wahlberg's don johnson miami vice outfit that he wears in the final scene most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to pulp fiction but it really has much more in common with the films of robert altman and martin scorsese the film is a triumph in style the opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in the player and absolute beginners the editing by dylan is simply phenomenal i couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an oscar nomination good will hunting was a better edited film the best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers i had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense when i saw the film a second time i had the exact same reaction to the scene unfortunately it may not have the same impact on tv as it did in a theater with good stereo sound it's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run because it is the best way to watch it anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on tv so get the dvd or a letterbox tape it is amazing how easy anderson makes it all look because this is only his second film the music sets costumes photography offbeat characters sex violence happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking,1
2562,shaky hand held cameras this piece was shot for television mind you not film not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story poor miss austen must be rolling in her grave all i can say is if you enjoyed the novel stop there until the bbc creates one of their smart sensible period masterpieces like pride prejudice with colin firth which speaking for what i imagine in my opinion austen would have revered the bbc would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and indigo girl over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to the specialist if you want austen as you love her look for the bbc logo,0
2563,the message of hero is quite clear the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over produced government sponsored dogmatic trash br br particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media roger ebert of chicago tribune david of slate charles taylor of salon and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero in so doing they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message the only critic that i know of who saw through the film's glossy facade was j hoberman of the village voice who wrote of the film's sanctimonious traditionalism and its glorification of ruthless leadership and self sacrifice on the altar of national greatness i for one sign my name under final pronouncement hero is nothing more than fascinating fascism,0
2564,i hate vampire movies with that said this one was very interesting to me i do want to point out one thing tho literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories you see count dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or we also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many them to be exceptional as i watched the film i realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat vampire connection br br duality of human nature if you ever read fables there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story br br the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex sang blind priest friend sang effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire tae ju playing both sides her ordinary boring life vs her thrill seeking vampire adventure etc won't ruin too much u have to watch the film and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance sex violence religion dark comedy tragedy vengeance you name it br br i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long but this film is very fresh and new something that i haven't seen b4 yet i wouldn't say this is cw park's best work but it is mos def the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing,1
2565,this is a decent movie although little bit short in time for me it packs a lot of action grit commonsense and emotions in that time frame matt dillon and the other main character does a great job in this movie the emotions and intensity were convincing and tense throughout the movie it is not typical fancy expensive hollywood cgi action movie but it was a very satisfying movie indeed for the price my evening was great because of this movie this movie is straight traditional action movie with great acting story and directing i would recommend this movie the character development of the characters were good and makes you believe that were are actually seeing a real event taking place because this movie i believe was made with cheaper budget the acting and quality were much higher,1
2566,take a young liberal idealist christopher boyce timothy hutton put in a top secret classification in a government front company because of his father's position team him up with a drug dealer lee sean penn who is wanted by the police and needs a new source of income and you have a recipe for espionage sean penn played the part of the punk drug dealer with a certain sang froid probably out of particular verisimilitude with such raunchy types the gall penn carries with him in every situation is unique he even suggests the soviets run drugs for him br br i've seen the movie over and over again and each time i see something new it seems to me that a major problem with us spy organizations is its inbreeding which leads to the hiring of an obviously unsuitable candidate by reason of temperament and inclination for a government front company br br i do recall when the escaped from prison and led the authorities on a wild goose chase i see that despite the escape he is now released a pity the soviets are no longer around to accept the wretch a cheery,1
2567,another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose as the name implies this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they're still using them as usual ancient burial grounds can you say poltergeist have been disturbed by clichéd greedy land developers building stuff br br the cgi if it had been better might have made the effect more treacherous looking but they skimped on the budget and it shows to comical effect the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like and it wasn't impressive the deaths are just poorly done again with shoddy cgi i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects as for the victims they look they're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams it's always obvious who's going to get it a character with only a few lines shows up strange noises are heard cgi dots fly exit character repeat several times br br still there's a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable unfortunately the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on so it's used too often when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do overall it's pretty silly but i've seen worse this flick is cheap but it's oddly fun to watch,0
2568,the cavern 2 out of 10 blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache br br i have something to ask all film schools could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady flailing the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing br br also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action film also requires light to work perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time br br for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth br br a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire i honestly can't for the life of me think of one br br now on to the screenwriter try to make at least one character likable i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story br br if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie you might have wanted to start with spelunking br br the cavern is a pretty bad film poorly shot with a confusing improbable and anticlimactic ending,0
2569,the gay desperado is wonderful throughout the banter between leo carrillo and harold huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today best line that would be my third choice diego is obviously the archetype for kevin smith's silent bob lucien n black and white cinematography particularly with the shadows was striking all i can say about ida lupino is thank god for dvd you can go right to the scene where she is trying on and and watch her standing in front of that mirror over and over again br br lest i forget that nino martini guy sings real too,1
2570,this focuses around the lives of four women all good friends and their male companions each has a story the men as well everything links everybody to everybody and everything is being brought to a quick change after a trip the girls take to palm springs br br basically the film is no different from other of the genre but i liked the details brooke shields is a divorcée that fears loneliness therefore she bangs just about everybody to get to have a warm body next to her in the morning but then can't really commit as a man i find these women are a blessing but she is not a happy person everything else that happens revolves around this crazy woman but in the end we get more clarity over life and relationships which is good br br i can't tell if the acting was bad it didn't seem to me the script was a little inconsistent but not more than any romantic comedy it's a bit more depressing than most which is good because you don't get dreary romantic comedies every day br br it's worth a watch with the especially if you have cheated on her or plan to,1
2571,the synopsis of this movie led me to believe that it would be a story of an unconventional woman challenging the conventions of the society in with she lives i like strong female characters and expected a movie much along the lines of chocolat with a less fairy tale and more bite what i got was a cast of despicable characters br br for a character driven movie to be effective i need to feel a connection or compassion for the people there was no one with whom i could relate in the movie grazia golino whose work i admired in rain man portrays a mentally ill probably bipolar female that is often rude aggressive and violent her husband bickers and yells when he is not hitting or slapping someone the children are rude brats they yell at each other and the females in the movie they attack other children with no provocation violence begets violence this seems to be an island of unfeeling aggressive violent and rude people all the way around br br the direction is not compelling there are intermixed scenes that attempt to be art but instead bore the viewer the location is exceptionally gorgeous but even that fails to be captured to the degree that it could be on film br br i would have to recommend that you stay away from this failure of a movie,0
2572,it's the one film i almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me normally even if i don't like a film i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end that way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself but with the million dollar hotel it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one i didn't normally like so much but coming from wenders it was all the more shocking to behold i know bono from u2 a good friend of wenders's wrote the script to this abysmal film and i wonder why wenders let him as buddy buddy as the two may have been stick to the day job bono is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess pretentious disjointed a mish mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon especially the leads jeremy davies milla jovovich and mel gibson none of whom i dislike normally the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible on a positive note the first five minutes of the film are extremely good with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2 but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film which takes a spectacular nose dive from then on all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered not even close,0
2573,this movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths well written by shane black the film is executed phenomenally by the cast under the watchful eye of director jack clearly is a director that we should look out for in the future his strength lies in his adaptation of personal experiences both on screen and in the classroom br br this thought provoking film is a must see for anyone who can appreciate action drama suspense and mystery as with all good films the viewer goes on a journey of their own to find their individual interpretation of the movie the mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the suspense you find your self looking for the answers along with marquette audiences have liked the movie on the festival circuit with many awards received they must have agreed that a w o l 2006 is well worth watching br br i'd love to own a copy how do i go about getting one,1
2574,a blackly comic tale of a down trodden priest showcases the economy that luis bunuel was able to achieve in being able to tell a deeply humanist fable with a minimum of fuss as an output from his mexican era of film making it was an invaluable talent to possess with little money and extremely tight schedules however surpasses many of bunuel's previous mexican films in terms of the acting francisco is excellent narrative and theme br br the theme interestingly is something that was explored again in made three years later in spain it concerns the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism amongst a society that rejects any notion of virtue father however is portrayed more sympathetically than sister whereas the latter seems to choose charity because she wishes to atone for her perceived sins whole existence and reason for being seems to be to help others whether they or we like it or not the film's last scenes in which he casts doubt on his behaviour and in a split second has to choose between the life he has been leading or the conventional life that is expected of a priest are so emotional because they concern his moral integrity and we are never quite sure whether it remains intact or not br br this is a remarkable film and i would urge anyone interested in classic cinema to seek it out it is one of bunuel's most moving films and encapsulates many of his obsessions frustrated desire mad love religious hypocrisy etc in my view is second only to 'the exterminating angel' in terms of his mexican movies and is certainly near the top of the list of bunuel's total filmic output,1
2575,as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time second only to the breakfast club the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time it's underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people it comes on tbs maybe once a year but sometimes longer the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious with only a few comic scenes in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin hes in high school who has a couple of best friends his two friends are sex teens the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures that are very funny gary is major in love with the new girl in school he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her he also cheats on the side you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much you can feel it even more in the second half gary's friend turns out to be a creep but his other friend is pretty cool the movie shows how mean people can be you can relate to a lot of this movie the plot sounds like your teen sex comedy but it's so much more than that it's a very honest movie it's also very 80ish which i love if you love the 80's or grew up in the 80's rent this movie but there may be some people that don't like the 80's but still may like this movie i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think it's very entertaining and very funny it combines very touching moments with very funny moments it's an underrated gem i have the movie i love it i give the last american virgin 1 2 out of,1

2577,bronson took the money and ran with this film he must have house payments like me this low budget film made in mexico reminds me of a few of those italians stinkers from over seas i heard i do not know if this is true but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes i believe this because why else would they make this film it sure wasn't to make money we had a whole lot of these canadian made stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry i wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in canada anyway back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect i believe they grabbed charles bronson in order to sell this stinker that dead body at the end looks very phony 3 10,0
2578,first off let it be known that i came into this movie not for the music actually i find it repugnant really i was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture on this point the documentary did fairly well one disagreeable aspect was the numerous scenes in which songs are played and the hyped up band and belligerent crowd are shown running amok if you've seen the first such scene you've seen them all this is party made up for by printing lyrics for some of the songs with these the audience is able to somewhat connect mentally with the band the lyrics are of far more interest than the jumble of sounds projecting from the speakers i don't know why all the lyrics were not printed scenes without lyrics slow ironic eh given the many references to the speed of the music the flow of the movie also insightful were the interviews with fans and bands though there is a letdown when the latter band's interviews prove to be not nearly as enthralling or humorous as the first two overall a good movie that i'm glad i saw i'll check out the follow ups if i ever get a chance br br favorite quote he tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter over himself and breaking glass br br broad punk generalization though their lack of vocabulary and hygiene and drug induced is often hilarious in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic juveniles who rebel just for the sake of rebellion as seen through sophomoric lyrics and naive attempts to philosophize and disregarding black flag who are slightly less misguided than their peers,1
2579,this is the first sci fi series that i have seriously become hooked on since star trek and i haven't watched trek in years it takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way it also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series the cgi definitely doesn't overcome the plot or the characters except for the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbor's dog is a 1 in my book he was a stroke of genius br br i am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones i hope and crossing my fingers and toes that nbc or someone else sci fi maybe will continue to run the series and answer those questions br br a really great classy show,1
2580,along with cops the goat is one of keaton's two funniest shorts which makes it one of the best shorts ever made this has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict how the mistake happens is a classic and then must elude the authorities best gags the bread line and t he elevator,1
2581,i checked out this video expecting to like it wanting to like it i like foreign films i like beautiful cinematography i know the critics liked this film including my favorite roger ebert and i don't mind slow films br br well it's beautiful that's about the best i can say for it the plot is very thin the shots are very long the glances are very meaningful the actors are very sincere and it seems like a very long movie i fell asleep half way though it woke up rewound the tape tried again it was a trial but i made it to the end i didn't like it any better for that,0
2582,ray bradbury run and hide this tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de evolution is not well known from the theatrical run did it have one and exists now as a dvd on the shelves released during a slow week br br what looks to be a fancy sci fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different back in time where a major company sells macho guys in the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles one slip of the foot butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man eating plants and beasties of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually ok br br yes that is the story and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters edward burns all buff and hunky is our hero du jour ben kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig catherine mccormack is the know it all woman creator and as an evil one all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop and the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time a must miss grady harp,0
2583,ok yes i know i'm a philistine and i have no knowledge of nor love for opera i readily admit that i might feel differently about this film if i did but i don't so for those of you like me skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty sometimes unclothed girls for what it's worth i thought the first segment with theresa russell who i didn't recognize was the best of the lot,0
2584,i love movies in this genre beautiful girls toilet humor gratuitous nudity so why didn't i like this movie no movie like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot who's who where is the money it's not se7en just make me laugh maybe it's me but i never felt this frustrated watching american pie movies or any other more modern national lampoon's movies this movie has no flow that keeps me smiling waiting for what's next instead i find myself stopping to think why did they keep that scene i do not recommend this movie if you are expecting van wilder think again the only fun i had watching this movie was guessing what movies the actors were in when they were kids 2 10 generously,0
2585,this without doubt one of the funniest and most entertaining movies i have ever seen i really enjoyed the characters in the movie they are all wonderful bizarre in them selves it's quite something i have never seen before in any movie br br the story is almost non stop from beginning to the end there are no boring moments i was totally captured by the movie and i thought the acting was great br br so if you want to see a fun movie you should look for the green butchers a great movie br br i give it 10 10,1
2586,du rififi chez les is a brilliant film which studies criminal minds and allows viewers to have a better understanding of criminals who are fundamentally not different from ordinary folks like us what director jules dassin shows is that criminal do have families and they care a lot for them that is why they adhere to a strict code of honor for them a family is not only made up of wives mistresses and children but also include casual acquaintances and close friends contrary to what many might find it hard to believe jules dassin has not tried to glorify crime in his film as rififi makes it clear that crime never pays it shows that all kinds of bad activities result in some kind of human loss apart from its philosophical stance is worth watching for its technical finesse while watching one of the film's most brilliant sequences about breaking of a safe one would find it hard to believe meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans this is a scene which nobody has dared to copy in hollywood,1
2587,looking for a movie for your turkey film festival the roller blade seven is on my list of the ten worst films of all time the plot the story of a post apocalyptic roller samurai warrior is a convoluted hodge podge of film references of everything from star wars to the seven the acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal the scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter frank black knight reminds one too much of john cleese's black knight in monty python and the holy grail word of advice frank when you stoop to doing a movie like this one your career is over i chanced upon this little stink bomb on a low end cable channel and i could not stop watching it is like watching a train wreck you just can't look away,0
2588,this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot as a french noir film its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts but to me this just added to the realism additionally i liked how non glamorous everyone was particularly the husband and the lieutenant about the only negative and the reason the film gets a 9 and not a 10 is because there was a glaring plot hole like another famous french film drôle de the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning but the characters made rather stupid decisions for this you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching the payoff is well worth the wait br br this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen period,1
2589,i have seen so many bad reviews on de los that i felt compelled to stand for it or at least i'll try first of all of course that it looks dated it was made in the seventies with very low budget but that's part of it's charm i like contemporary films but also dig the old ones for what they worth i'm not the one to feel the urge to only see or like movies with modern treatments and effects besides almost every movie buff likes old fashioned motion pictures who doesn't like films from el santo or plan 9 from outer space no matter it's overall quality in the aspect of pace is just a tool for covering again it's low cost and i think the constant dialogs are in order of a better character and situations development sure alive has better fx but i won't despise the old one just because of that and i don't feel quite attracted to english speakers in an event involving people from uruguay and for me that gives a plus to de los it's like even if from the seventies and based on a true event too would have a better remake now due to the advance of technology but i think i would stick to that one based on the emotions that offers regardless it's production date br br all of this is based in the impact that had on me because the first time i saw it was on tv and nowadays i don't think it has lost some of it's primal force of course it's been a long time and i've seen tons of better movies in every aspect of cinema but that doesn't diminish it's true value it's not a bad film and i place it above alive without hesitation just give it a break,1
2590,cartoon like special effects horrible acting and dialogue and dry plot this movie has it all my friend and i went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of but this was just too much the movie begins with a women and her son vacationing on a made up island in the region the women who just happens to be a doctor is in the area when a man collapses he has a strange wound on his arm and she immediately knows that it is a contagious virus the story goes on to show startlingly fast romance between the two teenage leads this is justified by the girl saying i know it's fast but it just feels nice anyway the entire island gets infected with this virus and the is brought in we are told that within three months if the virus is not treated and contained that it will spread to the united states and kill millions of people this information does not stop the from leaving the island to save themselves thankfully the cure to this horrible virus is found just in time and the entire island is saved to celebrate the death of there loved ones the island people have a smashing party where everyone is dancing having fun and forgetting about the horrible epidemic that just occurred,0
2591,babette's feast for me is about healing the schism between spirit and body in orthodox christianity this puritanical community in remote denmark is missing an adequate appreciation of all of god's gifts in creation they have taken the dualism of st paul to an extreme and stress the life of the spirit not the life of the flesh both elderly sisters in their youth were frightened by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village they and their parishioners cling to the narrow biblical interpretation of their former leader and the sisters' father the aging congregation has become testy and quarrelsome and the sisters don't know what to do enter babette a french stranger and someone to whom they can show kindness they have no way of knowing that she will ultimately return their kindness and give fertile soil to their dry dusty theology babette will give everything she has and in the process will teach the sisters and their flock about grace about sacrifice about how sensual experience as in the bread and wine of the can change lives and about why true art moves us so deeply when they can forgive each other and themselves they can focus on god's love that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present as a minister and an artist i can't recommend a movie more highly true art and true grace,1
2592,this is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america the mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass an opening sequence sees the mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a that they should set out for the new world or remain where they are it further shows life aboard the liner huddled masses indeed yearning to breathe free and conditions in ellis island where their journey still not over they are interrogated and examined to prove their to enter america what is not shown is the ship in longshot or indeed any shot that would identify it as a large ocean going liner what is also not shown is anything that would identify america no cliché view of new york harbour and the statue of liberty so that ellis island could be anywhere in any country perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a camera crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together slowly almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at screen left begin to separate from the third at screen right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock a powerful statement of society being fragmented there's a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families conditions at the time with almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it's not for the popcorn brigade at the multiplex but for the rest of us it's a very fine film indeed,1
2593,wow i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic time runner some things are better left unknown mark hamill's role is quite limited i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b movies of the 60's and 70's in those movies they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie memorable acting by mark with such great lines as don't try to run you're under arrest did i mention he says that exact thing more than once bill paxton fell into an type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session the hair the hair priceless bill truly should have been game over for bill but somehow he got treatment and went on to better movies this movie blows it is more dull and boring than the crazies at least that movie was crazy this is just boring do not watch this movie sober,0
2594,i'm sorry to say that but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen br br due to its name darwin's nightmare i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoria br br what i actually saw in this documentary is a loose accumulation of individual stories most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake and for a large part you can hardly call them stories it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection br br why does this movie waste time on showing us non relevant information on the families of the russian pilots several minutes are wasted for example on their private snapshots of wives and daughters mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile as if that could not have happened without the nile perch showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport showing us strange religious events for several minutes discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport talking to kids about their mothers fathers what they work and or how they died well guess what some died of hiv who would have guessed that those are just some examples i could go on for several pages br br this movie is absolutely unfocused and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social health hiv violence war problems then this movie might be right for you if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90 of what this movie shows won't be new to you and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep br br perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter,0
2595,curse of michael myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series after a very disappointing letdown in halloween 5 the series reached a near ebb in plot lines with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers curse of michael myers ups the ante in blood and gore but really represents a decay in the series' integrity it's too bad to as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr loomis pleasance has some good screen moments precious ones if your a fan of the series as the now very aged and as he says very retired doctor sadly he died before the movie was completed and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized right from the beginning credits halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made for tv movie then that of the block buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978 any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film dr loomis and donald pleasance deserved more,0
2596,some aspects of this production are good such as the performances of angela lansbury george cris and sal but am i the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by betsy joslyn as johanna she is terrible she the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand i also think the chorus isn't up to snuff they drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions overall i think this production is okay but sweeney todd can be so much more if done correctly this production doesn't come near the level this material demands the concert version with george and patti is much better,0
2597,eh oui impossible pas br br well paced highly entertaining film pretty good command of the french language and knowledge of modern france and history are recommended i don't think this film really works in any other language the film is incredibly much better than the previous one in search of apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions word plays etc that make for a really great movie the cartoon is recognizable but the film is very emancipated the cost of the film is put to good use indeed all the special effects fit into the movie you never feel choked by them br br oui les un mais à part imhotep br br a neighbour from the other side of the rhine,1
2598,never has the words hidden gem been so accurate bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like death bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but somehow death bed still fits into the bad category with a vibe that's somber and empty death bed is a true masterpiece of low budget horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision br br death bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds although not all that scary considering it's about a killer bed death bed possesses the qualities that make for successful horror a dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional not only is it intentional but from what i've read death bed is based on an actual dream george barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task br br old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid quite a bizarre dream indeed also this isn't quite the brand of b horror i was expecting considering the title and all before viewing this gothic gem i expected something more like class reunion massacre now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what i'm saying after considering all of the above i feel like death bed deserves only eight stars but since it stayed so obscure for so long we'll say the bed that eats deserves nine,1
2599,the word impossible has led many to select a particular view concerning any incredible task in 1927 it was believed no man could fly the breath of the atlantic ocean many had tried but failed and some even gave their lives to the effort nevertheless it had to be done as every challenge needs to be met with equal determination such then is the heart of this movie called the spirit of st louis the actor chosen for this historic film is none other than america's own james stewart who convincingly plays charles lindbergh although there are many facets of life the segment featured here is his efforts to be the first man to fly across the atlantic the story is an interesting one and for fans compelling to say the least seeking enough funds to build a special aircraft to the fateful decision to began the journey on a gloomy day in may 1927 as he was christened endured enormous risks which are featured in this superb film other notables which helped make this film believable are murray hamilton who plays bud gurney bartlett robinson as ben mahoney arthur space and charles watts as o w schultz the sum total of this now famous movie is that despite poor endorsement on its debut it has since become a classic in it's own right well done,1
2600,1 bolo yeung is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving iced drinks to his boss 2 a lot of street thugs looking like junkyard keepers get instantly overpowered by the asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a manure truck 3 thug let this to me shirt off gay model like muscles hee hap hap he's dead on the floor with his neck elbow chin or balls broken 4 cheap semi sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere digs the asian superhero 5 norton former c action movies star does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who traffics white slutty girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire snapping at them you reap what you sow 6 yes the local police captain is involved and yes the first butchered cop is the former patrol teammate of the super hero 7 action scenes are fake like a hee haw chinese tries some spinning kick b skinny leg of chinese to the throat of negro thug c finishing death move to his head too much like walker texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finally br br utter rubbish those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body doubles in other c movies and be credited at most collectively as stunt crew provided by the county prison,0
2601,i wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script who then he travels to hollywood to get even but hey it's still a fun film frankie of malcom in the middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and amanda bynes as his friend is also very good yea the film does work as an advertisement for universal studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film but i enjoyed it anyways grade b,1
2602,i can get over the political parody even if this was suppose to be a masters of horror flick br br but what i can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes and their sacrifice as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement br br to me it was purely insulting to arlington and our heroes i have family at arlington the idea that this guy dante would even portray the arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke br br i'm done with dante and done with moh,0
2603,a few years ago i saw the scent of green by the same director my feelings about both films are in fact the same beautifully shot but terribly slow and boring i saw this film in a sneak preview and left after half an hour couldn't stand it anymore how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are and how perfect their lives are i had a fantasy about a forgotten american g i still wandering around in the vietnamese jungle who was not aware the war had ended how he would suddenly pop up in the film and would start emptying his at the characters in the movie the red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film so i was not very much gripped by this film time to leave,0
2604,most of the other posts beat this movie up and deservedly so i've just got to chime in on the technical ineptness of the film makers it would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was because he had no clue br br spoilers ahead you have been warned br br stupidity br br spec ops team assembled from various military units whose members have never met each other before br br maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines parts ammo etc br br the sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun pistol caliber as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more proficient with br br one poor team member's night vision optics weigh more than the rifle does you can tell when he handles it that it is seriously top heavy br br the team leader sends out a team member to challenge the skeleton man when they first confront him challenge a 200 year old reanimated native american skeleton with a long spear and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe nosebleed i think not bubba br br bullets do not spark when they hit trees mr director a couple of people have already mentioned this br br the teams air support consists of a ubiquitous black helicopter only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles underneath someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the skeleton man doesn't fly and they are over the american heartland where there won't be any enemy aircraft they should have carried some air to ground missiles instead br br the air to ground consists of a door gunner with a semi auto ak 47 or 74 needless to say he only hits dirt should have brought a belt fed light machine gun br br door gunner later finds out that a grenade launcher is pretty useless as well br br a wooden arrow from a freaking recurve bow does not down helicopters mr director br br i pretty well could not take anymore after this point about 30 minutes and gave up you seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick it is just that painful,0
2605,this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian party or some similar group the strong man places himself above the law but not outside the law and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group and you'll see what i mean br br it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie,0
2606,this superb 40's post war classic tends to be overlooked these br br days when it was released in 1945 it cleaned up at the 1946 br br oscars mostly at the expense of it's a wonderful life ' both films were up for best film best br br director and best actor all won by years' frederic march br br and dana andrews along with an amateur actor harold russell a br br real life soldier who lost both hands in an explosion play the br br returning soldiers finding life is very different from what they br br remember myrna loy is superb as march's wife who has to keep br br the family together while he has been away the tear jerking br br scene where march and loy are reunited is magnificent all three br br men find that they have problems readjusting to post war life not br br least russell coming to terms with artificial hands and his finance br br cathy o'donnell trying to be too helpful sam is quoted that he doesn't care if the film makes no br br money at all as long as everyone in america sees the film so they br br will appreciate what these men went through if any film is worth 10 out of 10 it is this one,1
2607,i got stuck in traffic i live in sicily on the way to the theater at a military base to see superman returns was 15 minutes late and the only other movie playing was see no evil there was no poster up for it and just a short description of the movie on the schedule but my girlfriend and i decided to check it out as soon as i saw it was produced by wwe i just knew it was gonna be awful the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that i honestly considered walking out on and i've seen the ringer okay i would have walked out of that one but i was too busy sleeping the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid,0
2608,i found this movie to be one of the best for this time and era the cast was very exceptional and most entertaining to all that saw it i would like for my younger generation to have seen this movie but i haven't been able to find or see the movie in the past my first viewing was back in the early sixties and i have been looking for it every since the movie showed me potential of how far we come go to become a gifted at a craft where we could only have meaningless roles to act as buffoons and servants br br porky and bess showed some of the urban life of my neighborhood as i saw it in the time where i needed good solid male role models the singing and acting had me skipping for days playing the part of different characters in this excellent movie,1
2609,having read most of the comments i feel like i have a word to say as well br br what bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them i remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published yes it has interested me so much ever since i heard that it would come out that i have not forgotten about the articles i read back then in which tim robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other br br and i think that is completely right i have to admit that i believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti death penalty side but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice and this is a very rare thing in american films br br i have shown this movie to many people since it came out and i have seen all kinds of reactions death penalty supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief and many death penalty opponents including me grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world but i have even seen opponents turn into supporters this and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it so whatever effect it has on you the important thing is that it makes you think br br this is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent this may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson there is no lesson here you need to find one yourself br br everyone praises the acting directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the i will not repeat it all again br br so if you have not seen this yet do so if you dare to be challenged,1
2610,the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film then closed again br br watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen like all other movies nothing makes sense in this movie br br it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems in fact except as a warning it really isn't worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film br br from now on i will check imdb before watching any film br br hot darn imdb is forcing me to write more about this film i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it but if you had to chose between the two pick edison force,0
2611,a captures a mythical on a caribbean island to get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous results br br lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit the cgi scenes looked like a different movie ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b movie br br the best thing was john rhys davies his daughter the eye candy a close second john was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say he said it well good job given what he had to work with the was over the top and fun to watch too he had some funny bits the marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests there are a few pretty funny lines in this movie and a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief br br the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie i did like the gore of the legless man really since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie br br all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit,0
2612,only light spoilers in here br br stealing sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers dimwit victims and a few other side stories thrown in to eat up some time br br you will see some poor performances all around in this movie the drama is forced and the humor makes no sense whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with care for some tea none of it is believable this quite comfortably fits into the wannabe movie category br br you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie it's quite unprofessional and adds nothing it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty br br however if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storyline br br i voted 4 10,0
2613,first of all should cameron diaz ever be allowed to act again to call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances that was a historically horrific performance any small chance that diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that laughably horrible br br two the movie was extremely boring and not very thought provoking at all i can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors play out a terrible story br br third there was not a single likable character and even worse it seemed like that was done by design you were not supposed to like or feel sympathy for any character it was quite effective i wanted them all to just die to be honest aliens included kid included everyone was just one big mope in this movie everyone literally just moped around and they called it a movie you could barely distinguish the zombie employees with regular people because they all seemed like zombies br br lastly nothing really makes sense from the characters reactions and emotions to the literal story line it all just seems random this is just a really bad movie disguised and couched as a thinking mans movie which is meant to be confusing give me a break a bad movie is a bad movie and this movie was bad,0
2614,this film is truly a sorry excuse for film making the pacing is poor the budget must have been depressingly low and the acting is cut rate that is except for bela lugosi the audio at this point in time is also terrible with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as though a jet were taking off for the entirety of the movie if these things bother you at all don't watch this film br br if you can get past this however you will find that the idea behind the film is a very good one a german plastic surgeon bela lugosi was hired by the japanese to operate on several japanese agents and turn them into the of upstanding american businessmen whom the japanese have kidnapped and killed after completing his work he was betrayed by the japanese and thrown into prison he later escapes and travels to america to seek revenge on his patients through a series of highly publicized murders br br it seemed as though bela lugosi was the only decent actor in the film and to be honest the rest of the actors were completely forgettable and stodgy the leading actress ended up being rather boring and stereotypical while the police officer assigned to her case was the common chauvinistic and always correct dominant male that is found in many films of this time period br br i also found that the camera work was completely uninspired often taking the exact same angles of the exact same rooms time and time again after a while this tends to drag the film down setting a very slow pace for the action which is more or less non existent anyway br br to me the idea is a fascinating one and with a better writer director script equipment and actors it could become an excellent film sadly these handicaps keep the film back for now and i can't recommend it to anyone but the most open of movie lovers,0
2615,well i'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday we sat down to watch it and it was so boring i don't remember laughing once it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end elizabeth is great in this though maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life it's a very forgetful film,0
2616,i recently purchased lost horizon on ebay having vivid memories of the things i will not miss number from childhood i am an ancient 29 i also recently finished the novel upon which it is based i was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure a wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story subtly updated from the original film and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by james hilton sally kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic sally hughes who gradually warms to the charms of shangri la only liv flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher a role far more suited to a julie andrews type the fact that finch and hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell the songs do vary in quality the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper dvd release and a lot more recognition,1
2617,despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer br br by the way what has become of ms driver she had such a potential in the film industry br br this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare with the death of her father driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family hiding her jewish identity br br while i realize that this is a period peace it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotland br br the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing song voice of hers i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment what kind of name is mary i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian but does this name signify all the way br br in the interim mary finds love with the young father wilkinson and his emotionally unbalanced son br br in the end the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film br br the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more there is a definite underlying feeling of anti semitism by the wilkinson family but that's never allowed to come out,0
2618,watch the beguiled because it's a good place to begin when you study the femmes fatales in clint eastwood's filmography br br the smothering gothic sexuality of the beguiled has already been discussed what everyone missed is the synchronized sexual that occurs in a group of females living together especially when a man is introduced into the group they all become horny and then bitchy at the same time br br femme fatal filmography for clint eastwood inger stevens hang 'em high 1968 jean seberg paint your wagon 1969 shirley maclaine two mules for sister sara 1970 page the beguiled 1971 jessica walters play misty for me 1971 sondra locke sudden impact 1983 genevieve tightrope 1984 marsha mason heartbreak ridge 1986 peters pink cadillac 1989 and the best heart breaker of all meryl streep the bridges of madison county 1995,1
2619,working at a movie theater as a projectionist i have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out when i first saw the trailer for 'black snake i laughed and thought great another 'snakes on a plane' samuel l jackson movie but of course i wanted to see it for the laugh factor many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title the images on promotional ads and on the fact that justin timberlake is in the film personally i loved every second of this movie it tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another the story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live of course i do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from sam jackson christina ricci and yes even justin timberlake i encourage you to see 'black snake,1
2620,i enjoyed the movie very much everything in the italian job is simple an explosive guy a safe cracker a computer genius a wheel man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun this film is entertaining although it has no central idea it is a non stop movie with lots of actions all the stunt work is gorgeous from the speedboat chase in venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in los angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter the best boast chase i have ever seen i like the mini coopers the expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars the chase between the mini coopers and the motor bikes is amazing they chased underground i can say there was not a moment i was bored mark wahlberg charlie charlize theron stella donald sutherland john jason statham handsome rob seth green lyle mos def left ear and edwin norton steve really did a good job i like the actors in this film i have seen a lot of heist movie but the italian job is one of my favourites a great hollywood action movie without a drop of blood after all i do love this kind of movie,1

2622,this movie is a story of a catholic nun as an advisor of convicted killer on death row the movie describes what she does as a nun who does not have any productive role she might have had doubt in her actual role but eventually she does the role only a nun could do who has nothing but faith in christ in america there are so many movies that describe condemned criminals or jails those scenes especially execution are too much different from japan,1
2623,this is one of the best martial art kung fu movies of all time if u love martial art movies this is a not to miss from flying nuns to training monks this movie has top kungfu styles and a good story line its about a priest from the wu dang clan trying to eliminate all the fighters to be claim the title of being the best in martial arts after killing key members of the temple the faith of the is remained in the hand of two boys secretly training under a monk the white abbot or the priest from the wu dang clan develops new techniques that turn him into iron well this a not to miss classic it involves ninjas and nuns fighters it a great classic,1

2627,i had been amazed by director back in 2003 his first american project vacancy was less impressive but a decent start armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of a b movie br br it's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either br br what you are left with is one implausible situation after another a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score you're left with what could have been a below average direct to video featuring van damme or seagal br br this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time,0
2628,i just don't know how this stupid crap junk garbage good for nothing film is a blockbuster it was so boring with a very very weak or no story line and wasn't even a jot funny the film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about prem salman khan is a love guru and is helping hapless romantic govinda to get the girl he wants i'm not saying that i didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything i will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story the only two reasons why i can say it's a super hit are br br 1 salman khan govinda are on screen together but there first time together was in salaam e ishq which was a flop so it can't be but it was a really good movie br br 2 salman khan's name is prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including maine pyar kiya so it's just luck br br i heard that it's a remake of hitch i've not seen it i'm glad i didn't music is ok the only good songs are do you want a partner you're my love soni de but what is the use of it in a really bad film that too if you have someone like katrina kaif who dances with two left feet she is completely crap neither she knows acting language her voice is always dubbed for her dance and always fails to impress i do not like her one bit she was even disappointing in koffee with karan overall partner is a disposable film with a disposable actress katrina kaif its better off that she is kicked out of bollywood and never comes back again,0
2629,the man who knew too much 1956 is a remake of a film that alfred hitchcock made in england in 1934 with the same name in my opinion his later effort is far superior many critics and fans of alfred hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and doesn't have the spine tingling suspense of the original with peter lorre in both films the plot is essentially the same except the original is set in switzerland and the remake in it tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day vacationing with their young son and meeting a suspicious man that is very curious about their past it just so happens he's an agent that's looking for a couple involved in a plot to assassinate a world leader then he gets stabbed in a market because of it being found out that he's a spy and proceeds to fall into stewart's arms dying he tells him the whole story of the assassination plot stewart and day then find out that another couple they met were the couple the agent was looking for and have kidnapped their son the film contains excellent performances by stewart and day in a straight dramatic role as worried and frightened parents this film proved that doris day could act in suspenseful dramas as well as carefree musicals the direction by alfred hitchcock is top notch the film keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute the scene in albert hall is a classic the original is so slow paced and drab i don't know how people can compare the two just watch the remake and you'll enjoy it i give the movie a 9 out of 10,1
2630,i thought that eastwood's most unusual role was that in the bridges of madison county but that was until i saw the beguiled he manages to pull it off giving a very good performance and so does the rest of the cast the direction is imaginative given that the film was made in 1971 and had there not been some plot holes which the director seems to struggle to cover up at times we would be talking about an excellent film it remains powerful nonetheless br br 8,1
2631,i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it i stuck it out to the end but it was painful especially having to listen to that voice of the child as 1 remarked even though the girl claimed to be from chicago she didn't have a chicago accent it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accent but failed at that as well i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child why did they select this one and why force her to talk like that it wasn't even just the accent it was the script the monologue created for her the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me this era in history the type of characters that are poor and uneducated the setting and the love triangle as far as i'm concerned it could have and should have been much better i was just soooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie,0
2632,in the early 19th century a young woman with a falls foul of her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community but she meets a man who may see her differently and just may change life forever br br precious bane is a british broadcasting corporation adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by mary webb it's a beautifully filmed piece that is acted to an incredibly high standard the story screenplay by maggie is excellent and the period detail and use of dialect is second to none it's such a shame that this film has yet to get a dvd release one would have thought that with clive owen's great here as gideon rise to stardom the bbc would get it out there but sadly no so the only way of catching it is on the very rare occasions that tcm shows it the lead performance from janet mcteer as is simply brilliant guts and genuine emotion go hand in hand as mcteer gives it her all has to not only contend with her facial disfigurement but also the constant and hurt from the ignorant villagers this is a time when folk believed that if a hare ran in front of a pregnant woman it spelt doom a time of bull baiting a time of superstitions and talk of witches in spite of constant set backs is strong and resourceful even her own family knock her dreams back without realising it but this road may well be a terribly bumpy one but hope is everlasting and has hope in abundance br br 8 5 10,1
2633,then again i like rachael ray she is fun sweet fresh and such a joy to watch i have to alter just about everything she makes as i am a vegetarian but it's great to see her with a program that shows more of her personality after all she is a television personality i think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be down to earth the studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a environment some people have posted that the show sucks i guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her if you notice the early episodes of 30 minute meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years i'm sure she will find her comfort zone with this show as well good luck rachael,1
2634,this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while br br the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism as a result it fails on all accounts br br the acting is atrocious the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless br br klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves br br really don't watch this film some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many,0
2635,peter boyle was always a great actor and he proved it by his performance as a gun ho bigot making me hate him everytime he used the n word i watched him and his big mouth and wanted to punch his lights out just think peter boyle was a monk once now a supporting actor in everybody loves raymond susan sarandon making her first debut need a bath right away and enjoyed sharing it with someone else in his own dirty water i noticed a large ann doll creator john was the only thing that susan could actually trust and love and the doll appeared in quite a few scenes if you really want to know about the way out 70's with drugs free love and pipe dreams then enjoy the excellent direction of john g rocky and the karate kid i always thought that peter boyle should have been blown away in the end this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others,1
2636,this movie was nothing like the book br br everything was mixed up or changed most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book br br this movie never should have been viewed it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing br br i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j d br br honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is,0
2637,i like to think i have seen it all ss the one about a family of sabertooth tigers the one about a family of goat eater demon child a child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head several sasquatch flicks none of them good a couple of giant spider insect flicks endless hellraiser sequels endless sequels endless jason sequels a kickboxing scarecrow ax 'em which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's camcorder and so on i watched part of an stv the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems i have even sat through dreamcatcher as recently again as last night well i should say i sat through parts of it having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago but nothing compares to predator island about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite the meteorite looks like it came out of a superman cartoon from the 1940s so do the aliens for that matter the photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad i turned it off halfway through good luck,0
2638,no wonder a lot of us hate classical music and what are the children to think with educational pr like this serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue kids know when they're being talked down to and this is no exception why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids i must admit i enjoyed the actor who played beethoven he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of beethoven's character he obviously did his research otherwise this is a third rate rehash of the old abc afterschool special format with none of the occasional charm those short films had sorry about the rant but this is an important subject for young people to know about and it could have been done well i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible either way the kids are hipper than you think folks br br,0
2639,i had high hopes for this film even though i had not read the book richard gere and diane lane together should be good already but the film does not deliver on the promise i kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't i have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love that can happen but we never really get to know the characters i would have liked more focus on them the film reminded me in places of bridges of madison county and that film was far better i really felt for the characters in that film and there was a chemistry much more passion between clint eastwood and meryl streep that there wasn't between gere and lane each of them are very good actors in his or her own right simply not the right movie for them together,0
2640,i've seen this amusing little times the only problem is its currently unavailable on video or dvd i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release the much missed richard jordan plays an ex pat american whose just been released from prison he finds himself a job as an electrician in a bank it all goes well until he finds himself embroiled in a bank heist with his ex cronies david niven plays the mastermind ivan its an enjoyable little romp hopefully studio canal or anchor bay will come to the rescue look out for john rhys davies before he struck it big with raiders of the lost ark 'lord of the rings' in a small role as a barrister,1
2641,what do you get when you have a tenacious seasoned french police inspector by the name of maurice martineau is called to solve a murder case well simply a very entertaining fun film the re mastered black and white film quai des delivers the goods despite romance jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of 'who done it ' br br inch by inch technique by technique as seasoned by experience and intuition the patience of this master inspector etches into the truth but of course with the help of a bag full of dirty police interrogation tricks br br martineau is the centerpiece of this film the use by director henri georges clouzot of raucous background music to intensify the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful wrapper around the visual experience br br martineau eventually solves the mystery and arrests the culprit hey he is good but alas martineau too can keep a dark secret in his past who is that boy that is perhaps not his son br br some things can never get solved even beyond the closing credits,1
2642,a couple are split apart during a vacation early scenes lead us to believe barney jeff bridges' character has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction the film plays out some years later where despite a new love interest jeff kiefer sutherland is determined to solve her disappearance br br the storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work br br ok here we go the abduction scene aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where sandra bullock and kiefer sutherland are made to perform a little signed pet love ritual that's drowned in over sentimentality to the point of nausea we know they're in love the i do solemnly swear never to leave you speech only moments prior was ample thank you jeff bridges' robot accent is another example what is that for starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet he's turned nasty the entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who by a rather fortunate twist of fate has quite miraculous powers of observation the climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much much better it's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder i could go on but something positive needs to be said at a stretch kiefer sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance br br the 1988 original of the same name changed from the dutch title 'spoorloos' for english speaking audiences was recommended to me only for an online rental company to send me this later hollywood version by mistake i was surprised to find both having been directed by george sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake i am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot for that but it really doesn't take much doing,0
2643,a fine young cast is wasted in this empty mawkish manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both a cute comedy and an insightful drama the plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seems endless as characters do nothing but mope and emote the dialogue is filled with stilted cliches and fortune cookie attempts at pseudo philosophy br br apparently aiming at being a moving and profound look at life and love the film ends up being merely pretentious the only real weight is the burden that the talented cast is forced to carry as best they can but never fear they are held up by the puppet strings of the contrived plot,0
2644,as this movie unfolds you start to feel the conundrum of human existence if you carry with you questions inner wars unsolved puzzles about the meaning of life then you will feel this movie with every morsel of your body charles darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending war with god his theories resemble the fact that god has nothing to do with mankind has nothing to do with the amazing world that we live in savage harsh ironic and chaotic this words surround the mind of the character thrown into an universe of material truth who slowly pushes hope for god out from his mind nevertheless the movie as charles darwin still sees wonder and beauty beyond god in the universe of infinite evolution,1
2645,this show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny br br terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom they both deserved better but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes june talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion when she is not being a foil to terry and she really is clever br br the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class middle aged comedy and many people remember it fondly but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image,0
2646,i haven't seen the more recent which is based on this but i'd bet on this one as the better creation i know of no other movie that has so well portrayed the intricate tragedies of the drug trade and the 'war on drugs i've watched this one at least four times and am enjoying it again as part of masterpiece theatre's 30th anniversary presentations,1
2647,this program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions beyond this purpose the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go in the electromagnetic spectrum i feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator fortunately the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel in case they are unable to fully the predictable and shallow plot line i did find amy to be a superficially positive character as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields unfortunately her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines amy elects to employ resulting in amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice this show is unpalatable in any amount although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's god given filtering processes by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume,0
2648,my name is earl 2005 br br review for i have seen this br br this is something else first off how is this rated so high i cannot understand that this show is filled to the top with either annoying people stupid people or just plain unlikeable the gags are hideous br br i saw one episode where the wife of earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish not kidding that wasn't funny that's repulsive then she and earl's extremely stupid brother and i mean stupid then had sex i nearly threw up br br this has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time jason lee is a talented actor but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible comedy br br earl is now in jail for this current season let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery br br the last word this show would be funny to people who think larry the cable guy is funny to the rest of the world not a chance avoid like the plague,0
2649,the critics were like a movie that will break your heart etc so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie br br i'll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content this movie tries to touch you to reach your heart but it fails at least for me and for my friend too br br everything that happened happened only on the screen it was always there not here where i am i thought most of the time hmm something's happening on the screen but it's only on the screen it's not real br br movies which succeeded much better in touching me east of eden 1955 terms of endearment 1983 jerry maguire 1996 babe 1995 mies 2002,0
2650,for a film made in senegal based i guess loosely on carmen the book by prosper this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films br br ms as the of the title is very good to look at her fiery dancing smolders the screen as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film br br this is a that aims to please to all genders but a real carmen she is not br br we would like to see ms in other films in which her talent is better used than here,0
2651,boogie nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997 i could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it i'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance disaster epic titanic again the fact that boogie nights did not even receive a best picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow minded the academy is only atom the sweet hereafter and robert zemeckis's contact came close to being as great as boogie nights no other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as tarantino's pulp fiction until now paul thomas anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded just as tarantino gave john travolta's career a kick p t anderson has given burt reynolds the kick that his career needs boogie nights will also undoubtedly make stars of don cheadle heather graham and john reilly overall a wonderful film the best since pulp fiction maybe even better,1
2652,this movie was much better than i expected after a couple of films by will smith that weren't that great like i robot he is back to being likable and fun in this one smith plays hitch a date doctor most of the film centers around him teaching albert how to be himself and get a date with cole a rich famous celebrity whom he works with albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what not all hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around br br during all this hitch meets sara a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men hitch charms her so of course they go out but hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them he doesn't believe in love himself he has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college but he likes sara so keeps going after her sara's friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor so sara tracks the doctor down only to learn its hitch so of course she thinks he's a pig then it's up to hitch to explain to sara and what he does so they both end up forgiving br br final verdict good has some laughs and is entertaining i recommend it,1
2653,i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in dear john but it was very slow moving and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels ironically i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action br br the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very hang dog series of expressions in response to loss,0
2654,each story has a lesson for young and old but what more i have to say may spoil a future story but i believe what i have to say is for everyone just for one particular episode the soldier and death br br okay of all the stories the one that sticks out for me is the soldier and death because is was the point in my life i realized that life was terminal i am not kidding the airing was on my 8 1 2 birthday and i will always remember it i didn't remember its title until tonight but i new the synopsis may 15th 1988 br br it is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part in life it is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact i am living proof currently 28 yrs old that children can accept this fact and from time to time remind adults br br i write this with tears in my eyes heath ledger a wonderful actor my own age died today it kinda reminded me of many lessons i have learned in my life so i write this as a reminder to young and old no one is immune to whatever is in store for us br br i hate to say that death is going to happen but this story was the first time i saw death as not a bad thing but a part of life was quite literally in this story i can't help it it was a life changing moment for me and will alway be br br and for that br br i love you jim henson and i still remember much of your work in life up until the day you died and your memorial muppet show and thank you brian henson for keeping the workshop alive honest i do thank you all of your co workers editors and interns br br the stage is just a stage and a show is just a show but imagination will create magic that forever the world will know br br thank you br br and for all who doubt me dance magic dance,1
2655,i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them this movie is horrible and it is not because i do not know what the director was trying to convey or i am too stupid to understand the plot this movie is horrible because of poor direction screen writing and acting this is the trifecta of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video it tries to be something like high tension hostel and with the lifting of some of those ideas but it just does not work i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted,0
2656,yes i know that this movie is meant as a comedy and the humor is over the top but the theme about people getting less intelligent in future time might not be so far fetched i cannot say that it will happen but if we don't take proper care of our educational system than this could be a possibility i have noticed that some schools aren't teaching facts anymore like history geography basic stuff the focus is more on learning practical abilities the theory behind most subjects may be boring but is essential in understanding how things work in the movie there is this ridiculous example of people growing crops with in stead of water well we can laugh about it but if you never been taught that water contains minerals necessary for plants to grow so how would you know to me this is a scary notion so now you understand why this subject isn't funny anymore it could be that mike judge is making fun but at the same time is warning people for a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast am i taking this movie too seriously yes of course to each his own fun i loved mike judge's work beavis and butthead and office space in these he was able to be critical and funny at the same time in idiocracy i missed this most of the events are too absurd and as i said earlier very scary i do think if you are in the mood you will like this movie,1
2657,dakota incident has to be one of the strangest westerns i've ever seen not good but definitely strange br br a driver less stagecoach rides into the town of christian flats with all passengers killed it's scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the on the warpath out there but linda darnell regis toomey john lund whit bissell and ward bond each have their reasons for going on and dale robertson who killed john doucette in a gunfight after doucette and skip shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team br br of course the attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film br br dakota incident came at the very end of republic pictures before herbert j yates pulled the plug on his little studio westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind roy rogers made this would not have been a rogers product br br in fact it's beyond belief the characters aren't ground in any kind of reality whit bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but robertson discovers it's iron fool's gold toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst darnell is after a cheating manager of her's but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him lund is looking to bring in robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive for that he'd require help but doesn't have any br br but the worst is ward bond who's a united states senator on his own peace mission to the in real life bond was a most right wing individual and i'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal he's really quite the fatuous fool but i think that might have attracted him to the role br br i tried to get into dakota incident but couldn't and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least br br give it three stars for the cast involved,0
2658,i rented this movie without having heard or read anything about it what a shame this movie is intelligent witty hilarious fast paced and realistically ridiculous the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd tired stereotypes it was refreshing to watch i couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not so mainstream movie into the starved for intelligent comedy mainstream the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness heartbreak and comedy is so rare these days i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row it is so weak in too many ways to mention i guess i'm just happy that movies like seeing are still being made somewhere out there,1
2659,i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm very bad acting low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno 23 years old playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita 1962 only a more innocent lolita she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum falling all over this old man willing to give him anything as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him any man in his 50's that had a beautiful virgin teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride would be insane not to take advantage of her it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita appearance in the movie,0
2660,i'm torn about this show while most parts of it i found to be hilarious other parts of it i found to be stupid and simply shock for shock sake the off the wall parody of some of the cartoons are brilliant as indeed are a lot of the scenes with the children however i don't think it's clever getting little children to say rude things it's not that i think oh poor children they're being exploited it's just that it's really not clever it's something that anyone could do therefore making it as simple and pointless as making a paper airplane in order to make this show better they would have to stick to the natural responses from children which i think can be funnier than the scripted at time br br by far the funniest part of wonder is clarence the blue puppet who wonders around the streets talking to and annoying strangers it's really funny and it's mostly improvised seeing him in a long scene about the importance of patience test the patience of an extremely patient man was by far the funniest scene in my opinion br br you should watch this show though because all in all it's very funny even if it is stupid at times,1
2661,i cant put it any simpler than that this is a terrible film i've worked in the industry and made several short films myself so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously i absolutely hate this film i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others it is a piece of sh t the writer director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager the characters are unrealistic the lead woman doesn't think of taking the policeman's pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a molotov cocktail please and not even likable hell i hated her and cheered when she died i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh t with no real thought behind it to me this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year congratulations you now rank up there with such greats as micheal bay in the prestigious shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film club i hope you read this i really do and to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you,0
2662,i'm only going to write more because it's required however the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was you pretty much know who's in on it from the beginning in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns acting 'talent' trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens you never really need to wonder in this 'mystery' br br the more i write the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment but rules are rules i really feel bad about saying this but this is the lowest i've ever rated a movie i think it makes me wonder what i'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for however i thought this film deserved a 3 since i believe there was some talent in the film johanna watts or is it watson did a pretty good job she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well the man who played the character that was 'the did well too for his short part br br many of the actors did an 'ok' job but the lead actor david forget his last name terrible with names was pretty bad i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for 'the young and the restless' or of our lives' if you try you can just picture him in a white lab coat playing a doctor with multiple personalities on it doesn't help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap although i'm pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder though without the obvious and sound editing br br first time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted though i wouldn't watch it again unless i was paid a large sum of money,0
2663,i am surprised that so many viewers didn't find all the symbolism in the movie it's what made the movie an incredible work of art the story deals with some of the saddest content a movie could hold yet it is one of the best movies i've ever seen because of the need for your own imagination and the brilliance in the storyline br br if you will pay close attention the message is there the younger brother is killed by the stepfather the older brother made up the story about the wagon flying as a way to deal with the pain of his brother's death there are those that would argue why would he lie to his own children with the story to me the answer is because he doesn't want to share such ugliness with his own children or that he has blocked it out and replaced his memory of the horrific event with the thought of his brother flying away to safety i've read some of the reviews that believe he was an only child and that he created the younger brother as an escape to deal with the abuse he suffered although this is an interesting idea i love the imagination used to come up with that i don't think he would have lied to his own children about having a little brother but i do find it plausible that he would have lied about his little brother's death however i like that idea of an ending much better than the notion that the movie had no symbolism at all br br there are many different takes you can have on the movie but if you take the movie at face value two brothers creating a wagon that flies to escape an abusive stepfather you've missed the brilliance the fact that i was able to see the subtle messages in the script were what made the movie so incredible to me it requires your own thought process and your own imagination to make it work dig deep when you watch it you'll be amazed at the genius contained in the film the only other movie i've seen as close to this in symbolism and subtle messages is pleasantville but that's a comment for another movie,1
2664,this is without a doubt the worst sequel i have ever seen i've seen plenty of them to make that conclusion the plot is simply ridiculous i can catch a ball run around a field too why can't i play in the superbowl yes i know this movie was intended for children but there are just some plots that even children can realize are totally dumb unrealistic the first air bud movie was pretty good but this one was a total crash disney is loosing it if i controlled who won the razzie awards i would give this one a couple have a nice day,0
2665,well the name in the summary should tell you everything fred olen ray the modern king of low budget flicks be it for tv or direct to video i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore with the death of drive in b movie double features and all br br creator of such cult classics like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island br br well i kind of like this guys stuff its mostly entertaining in a distinctly cheesy campy and especially cheap kind of way and if he's one thing he's a pro something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz br br but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his insipid acting an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes if you are out for real f o r goodness or rather badness look out for the above mentioned ones and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s i think he lost a bit of his edge lately,0
2666,crazy six is torture it must be albert worst film even blast and ticker are better i can´t believe how boring this film is how this even got greenlighted i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was this isn´t good bad movie it is simply bad bad bad bad bad movie br br 1 out of 10 ½ out of,0
2667,after watching avalon which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx and several anime films written by oshii including jin roh which is fantastic i decided i should check out the oshii cinema trilogy box set being that the red spectacles and stray dog are related i will comment here on both and let me tell you it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while i first watched stray dogs and then the red spectacles i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen for only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters who are only dressed in the cop outfits for a few fleeting scenes the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations i really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all i love the wolf brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot but the films themselves leave much to be desired i would suggest not watching these films and certainly do not buy the box set like i did unless you enjoy wasting money oh and if you are wondering what i think about the 3rd movie in the set talking head i couldn't even bring myself to watch it before i purged the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a 20 loss if you want cool japanese live action check out or ichii the killer or the series,0
2668,hello looking for a movie for the family to watch on a friday night can't find what your looking for i thought this was an extremely enjoyable movie good for the whole family i found that it had a remarkably rare combination of it being appealing to both adults and children alike it was brilliant to say the least bruce acting was top notch there was a lot of humor in it and overall a great movie in my opinion it's a must see movie and i don't think that about a lot of movies believe me when i say it takes a lot for a movie to get me to think that it's clear that there was much work done by bruce willis and cast to get this movie done excellent story good acting and again overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie,1
2669,imagine this br br whenever two people meet in this movie one of them is shot the plot just does not exist it appears that someone shot some action sequences and then tried to put them together to make a movie out of it if you decide to watch it you will regret it,0
2670,sad in every aspect this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit warners wanted it to be overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved this film and robocop 2 are proof that irvin kershner did not have any real control over the empire strikes back connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in 1971 but this didn't bring him back at all octopussy was released several months before this film and easily it imagine that a roger moore bond not only better than a simultaneous connery release but it and compared to never octopussy is on par with 2001 br br the worst bond theme song even worse than the man with the golden gun pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence my god who cares and the most atrocious collection of non talent as far as the fabled bond girls go does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this and barbara carrera just plain stupid but the way kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any she is the that would become the very impressive which was about the best feature of goldeneye but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film br br casting as a black agent was an excellent idea but the buddy interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together witness the scene where to escape local authorities they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh,0
2671,i saw this turkey in the theater but i had a good time the special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production a toy boat representing a freighter moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction the red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch whatever cache vincent price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work calling this a documentary is like calling britney spears a musician about 20 minutes into this something struck me as very funny maybe it was price's overly dramatic intonation of the oft used line they vanished into the devil's triangle cut to black next story once i started laughing my friends joined in next time vinny said the crucial line someone in the back yelled out good after that it got almost as many laughs as a marx brothers film nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature chariots of the gods,0
2672,at 2 in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever br br 2 37 is a brutal honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers all intertwined all dealing with their own personal dramas while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix  the beautiful would be popular girl dealing with body issues the over obsessed with his grades there are several horrors that are as far from main stream as you can get including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past br br the movie is mixed with documentary style interviews from the characters which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative the pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie the young australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular theresa palmer who's heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nomination br br the film is very well shot with terrific direction some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the five minute long suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its' viewers it draws you in right from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom ultimately it's a beautiful made but slightly disturbing look at teenage life,1
2673,this little film is hysterical full of stereotypes about gays straights dwarfs british tea and pubs american gun culture divorce and marriage yet it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each kathy bates is amazing grace beasley and as a character actor of staggering range she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in fried green with the help of other comedic talents like dan as max her ex lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown chicago and rural england the story is just intriguing enough to entertain jonathan price plays victor fox a closet gay singer murdered by a cross bow killer in chicago his valet lover dirk simpson played by the stunning rupert everett must overcome victor's siblings including lynn redgrave who want to turn their home into a tribute museum and teams with bates and her dwarf daughter in law beasley to find the killer among the homeless of chicago br br the entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit and are excellent esp the talented price and bates this implausible storyline both funny and bizarre is one of the most off center films cameos by julie andrews barry and sally jesse raphael should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is strange funny and off center but with a good perspective about people with every kind of difference,1
2674,i was a huge fan of this series yesterday i watched it again on dvd i was apprehensive about whether laughs would come or not but in a few episodes i was laughing hysterically and some episodes were good acting wise bedi raja satish shah is brilliant whereas is plain bad but i think she gets the job done maybe a better actress could have been used in place of her this series shows what good clean comedy is br br if this series were to air in the current year i would have given it 9 10 and to think that this series is almost 25 years old and its comedy is still good i give it 10 10 i would highly recommend this series for watching on dvd,1
2675,goofy story about a young man arquette who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr nicholas the film is written ridiculously direction is odd dialogues are out of place and scrambled the actors didn't do it much justice either arquette is annoying throughout ian nicholas was nonexistent macy was decent but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance he was at least tolerable this is a stupid film in my eyes boring at times not entertaining just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody imdb rating 5 5 my rating 4 10,0
2676,i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap when i watch it i feel like i'm watching a police version of coronation street or something similar i have to say i still like the bill as i'm interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over br br as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill most of the great characters are gone now although a few still remain i think and i'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't its just that they lack the tough looks personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble br br overall being one of the only police programs on television these days the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness if thats the right spelling and would now be classed as a terrible unreal television soap br br recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved 2 10,0
2677,i loved this movie i saw it when i was about 8 years old and almost seven years later this evening i got to see it again i really thought it had an interesting idea they only thing that upset me was the ending which i felt was a cop out 'round here it's hard to find this movie and i was lucky enough to have seen it on bravo i also expected to see more drew barrymore in here too,1
2678,there was something about the original three films that made them so special and delightful probably the length of them unfortunately this lacks the charm but it still ends up being a fun film br br the bright shimmering side is that our favourite figures are still doing a cracking great job there is good animation used there is a silly but well structured and entertaining plot an exciting fun adventure a good plot idea a were rabbit and a giant competition and good new characters br br as well as lacking the original charm the only other slightly gloomy side of the film is that the humour though good is slightly overdone especially compared to the original films br br the popular giant competition is drawing near and wallace and gromit are helping control rabbits from eating any now they are anti they are doing a good job but soon there is danger afoot a were rabbit is nearby br br recommended to all wallace and gromit fans and to people who like films enjoy wallace and gromit the curse of the wererabbit,1
2679,i have seen this show when i was younger it is a really good show to watch it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old barney is definitely super de duper b j is pretty funny bop is very cute the kids are very cool too this show is about learning about numbers kinda like sesame street but different type of show and characters like barney the purple dinosaur b j the yellow dinosaur with a baseball hat on his head and baby bop the cute green dinosaur with a pink bow the first one that started was very old barney and friends show but then the second one was different to be new episodes also the last one in the 2000 was new scene of barney's park they also have a show of barney at universal studios in florida where you see barney b j and baby bop and then when the show is done you get to go play shop and meet barney it's a very good show watch this show when you learn about many things you will like it the movie and the live show at universal studios florida,1
2680,mullholland drive proves once again that david lynch is the master of cinematic expression at the screening last night i witnessed a brilliant addition to the history of cinema the performances are astounding the score entrancing and the photography mesmerizing david's ability to weave the many elements of film making into a unique and stunning cinematic experience is as i watched mullholland drive i couldn't help but realize that with david lynch in this world we are truly blessed the cinema is blessed as well for in the films of david lynch we are shown that one man's vision can be realized with stunning results we realize that blockbusters are not the only path we realize that a true cinematic artist has a chance in this world and in that we are blessed indeed,1
2681,i have copied my video of this on to dvd so that i can enjoy it whenever i like and it makes a very successful and rare wedding present as well this is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel everything about it is just perfect and it has aged amazingly well there is always a chance with something this old that it might appear a bit creaky next to more modern dramas but more than holds its own br br the quality of the acting is amazing with janet mcteer making a superlative prudence and a young clive owen stomping around as the taciturn gideon br br i challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least a little at the sheer romance of it all it is the perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are snuggled up on the sofa br br i really can't recommend this highly enough,1
2682,yep those of my generation who grew up watching those old cartoons were spoiled the 80's joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television well written stories well developed characters granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line fast forward almost twenty years later and enter valor vs venom the animation was average at most the movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force then we have character development or lack there of dusty likes to be all dusty slice and dice like to do things together what did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of jar jar binks as for the story i like a bit of sci fi but that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the joe universe mega monsters or zombies anyone but i give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes i'm not a huge fan of se and ss but i did like the fight scenes between the two if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it i admit to not being able to appreciate as i should again everything joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of gi joe if you can appreciate for what it is you will enjoy it,0
2683,i have to admit before i watched this film i thought this is one of those soppy love stories where everything works out fine and dandy all the way through but i was proved wrong when i actually sat down to watch this i found that it was in fact a really good story about a family who go to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and there the youngest daughter baby finds love but has difficulty getting there with her new found love due to disagreements with her father but along the way helps another dance instructor and risks the whole relationship a truly heartwarming film like no other br br 10 10,1
2684,i don't know how people can watch this the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die houses burn down car crashes babies die and cast members being killed off every week its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings its so depressing i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or house shall we torch in a months time ' br br its the most depressing absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore,0
2685,my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian at first i didn't want to watch it but i loved the movie it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime they portrayed the very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more not only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is i think being a would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to see the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could,1
2686,i've been a classic horror fan my entire life many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on horror incorporated and creature feature night sadly i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleep br br i don't think i've ever seen a horror picture where everything was so matter of fact dr doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural yet before long he's medically treating dracula and watching larry talbot change into the wolfman while hardly blinking an eye he and talbot discover the frankenstein monster like it's an everyday occurrence is all fired up to bring the monster back to life but after talbot and nina protest he's like aww you're right no big deal after realizing dracula's treachery he opens the count's coffin to sunlight and poof he's gone just like that br br the only person who didn't appear to just be phoning in her lines was jane adams as nina her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the film and no one even tries to rescue her she dr and the monster all perish while talbot and casually leave the castle br br definitely the low point for universal during it's classic horror years,0
2687,the blue planet series is without a doubt one of the greatest documentaries ever made on the ocean for five years filmmakers worked tirelessly on the series getting footage that has never been seen by anyone i e in the title the deep br br i highly recommend you watch this series to see the fish outside of the small pictures shown in textbooks is truly a treat but only a needle in the vast haystack of the sea that blue planet covers from the open ocean to tidal pools coral seas to the deepest darkest part of the ocean itself the bbc takes the viewer on an almost magical journey through the ocean br br i have to admit one of my earliest dreams in life was to be a marine biologist and after seeing this series the dream was revived i have studied the oceans of this world for years and have seen countless documentaries on coral and dolphins whales and but in all no one has managed to capture the life beneath the waves quite as well as this group of people br br watch the 'blue planet' series in it's entirety i promise you won't regret it,1
2688,this movie just arrived to mexico and since i read very good reviews here about it i decided to go watch it with my friends and girlfriend but i was greatly disappointed i don't understand how people can rate it 10 10 i mean screenplay and directing were beautiful but a great overall movie need a good story which this flick lacked altogether br br i've enjoyed several dramatic asian and european films but they had a good story watch this movie at your own risk unless you are eastern european or orthodox i don't think you will like it br br half the people on the theater left including my 4 friends who waited outside since they were really bored so was i but i always wait till the end of the movie br br regarding the movie it was extremely slow paced with a lot of time wasting scenes the full length of the story could have been shown in no more than 40 minutes but they made it longer by having scenes of the monk getting coal that is like 15 minutes of the whole movie plus panoramic views and so on until they made it a full length movie a really boring one br br i recommend you listen to me if you still watch it come back and rate this comment as useful after wards to help people avoid this waste of money,0
2689,you may like tim burton's fantasies but not in a commercial like show off lasting 8 minutes it demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace,0
2690,thriller is the greatest music video of all time performed by the greatest artist of all time thriller really sent music videos going and other artists have been trying to copy thriller in one way or another ever since it's a thriller,1
2691,tragic hero is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films focusing on family crime loyalty and revenge also this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was at the time however this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time br br one reason is the acting with the exception of chow yun fat the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness as a result we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don't particularly care what occurs with these characters br br another reason is its lack of focus the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing not knowing what the character's motivations are br br the film's climax does contain a decent gun fight but again since we don't care about the characters we don't care who lives or who dies the scene loses it's intensity and suspense because of this the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing br br in general this is a strictly average film and isn't recommended to the general film viewer only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing,0
2692,clint howard brother of more talented ron stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people striving to be a movie that's of the 'so bad that it's good' variety this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as 'so bad that it's well bad' it's the constant cinema the pillow stuffed 'fat kid' or the sleep inducing 'horror' that soured me on the film i don't know all i know is i loathed the film and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b horror films paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this his only 'mainstream' film a wise choice indeed as horrible acting nonsense storyline and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity another reason to steer clear br br my grade d,0
2693,i have never felt the need to add a review to this website until now but having just sat through the film i felt it necessary to warn parents who may be thinking of showing it to their children please don't this is no disney film this film tells us 'life is cruel' and if you show it to your children in my opinion you are too br br the video box describes the film as a for all and the imdb plot outline describes it as a 'family film' i just had to find a definition of 'family film' and came across the following usually consisting of comedies or adventures these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of helpful animals friendly supernatural beings and fantasy worlds all geared to stimulate and appeal to the imagination whatever the situation there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned on the way not an apt description of tarka the otter which contains some thoroughly unpleasant scenes totally unsuitable for young children and an ending that qualifies the film as a 'feel bad' movie the lesson learned as i said life is cruel family entertainment i don't think so unless you hate your family that is br br another review more revealing than this but worth reading can be found by following the reviews' link,0
2694,new year 2006 and i'm watching glimmer man again say what you like i find steven seagal's movies amusing like many comments good fight sequences i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration bit like schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films although that tended to be self deprecating br br but the one i like here is brian cox one of the most versatile actors around pity about his hand and foot but so much for withstanding extended interrogation must have flunked that class at the farm br br as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement never mind it's entertainment,0
2695,a wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller to me the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one and they should have gone for an all out comedy for example rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy the scene where betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy an even better example is the hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through freeman's character early on about the plight of the indians i mean yawn they should have given freeman something funny to say in that segment but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring pc speech br br there is yet more new age pc ness in the form of the ending the girl not only doesn't get the boy she gets no boy at all in fact the message is that the girl needs no boy at all bit of a feminist statement there the first half hour is weak but the movie gets better ironically once zellweger gets to kinnear i say ironically because i'm not much of a fan of kinnear's though he's solid here zellweger is very cute as usual she has the sort of all american cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy and i have to wonder why more of such women aren't represented nowadays instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars such as diaz roberts aniston lopez or barrymore br br since the movie tries to be very serious at times i have no choice but to criticize freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker with the heart of gold there is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between freeman and rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son,0
2696,a beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy there is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself or herself with hilarious distinction however the real star of the film is the unseen director frank oz who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to miss piggy's encounters with kermit the frog this is a not to be missed film,1
2697,not too bad entry in the series heavily with war propaganda but rathbone bruce's sincerity keep me happy br br it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish just how many are there holmes and moriarty independently reeling out the dancing men code so fast was amazing watson so why weren't you amazed the post explaining the bomb sight tickled me it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be critically watching this over 60 years later this and i think every other potboiler from universal at this period were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now 2005 and tightened up on the script and sets br br lionel atwill was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make up that made him look so haggard as moriarty br br the important thing about sw though is that this was the first holmes film roy william neill directed i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one thus establishing a marvellous ambient continuity,1
2698,i've heard that this move was put together by a bunch of high school students as a high school art or theatre project it's not too bad unless you lived near in the seventies or knew someone involved in the making of the movie this is pretty awful most of the actors are clearly not actors but locals who volunteered bob wilkins the original host of creature features on in oakland appears but only for about a minute some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it's own but there is no continuity between the two watching without dialog you'd assume that the movie had 2 monsters i guess the most aspect is that even the main characters who i assume are the kids behind the movie cannot even pretend to act these kids must have been involved in theater in some way to want to do this project but they display zero believable emotion in front of the camera,0
2699,rock star is a well told hollywood style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how ripper became rob replacement for judas priest mark wahlberg poured on his likable boy ish charm and performed with believable admirably something he has been known to do since the release of boogie nights br br stephen herek no stranger to musically themed movies takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species the hair metal rock god wahlberg's izzy acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true his likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the metal goat horn hand sign several times over br br the only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast namely the other members of the band were not fleshed out or even introduced properly more interaction with these life long rock musicians would have amplified and solidified new surroundings br br naturally rock star is filled with great music rabin's score the steel dragon's original work and plenty of 80's style metal hits makes this soundtrack a must have let's all hope that films like rock star not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very needed revival,1
2700,this greatest movie gives us clue to the depth of our souls in most deadly moments of our lives my heart is shrinking every time i saw the scene of hanging i have no words any you must see this brilliant picture,1
2701,awful br br despite the good performance of ed harris diane kruger and the strong budget the reason for the 3 stars the movie is by far the worst i saw about a composer and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music i agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography that otherwise couldn't be so charming this was done in amadeus with best results but this b copy here is a flaw beethoven had a strong personality but was a sensible artist here in this movie however he looks much more as mike tyson i wonder also whether despite his deafness he heard all the in the last scenes may be a implant i prefer to listen to the ninth on a cd with some nice maestro today most of them conduct modern wagnerian orchestras by the way i gave amadeus 10 10,0
2702,the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome curly howard also the life long friendship with larry fine the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble the actor who plays curly howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts,0
2703,i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h p lovecraft's the lurking fear that was shot in louisiana outside of a few changes names setting this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own twist ending that you could see coming from a mile away either way it is a much better adaptation than full moon's the lurking fear too bad it is a terrible film director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short i swear i counted maybe two camera movements the creature design is cheap we're talking store bought masks here but shot in a dark manner intentional or not where they are somewhat creepy the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well file this one under good adaptation poor execution,0
2704,the best thing from the american pie bakery i found the humor and the plot to be far more engaging audience than any of the american pie movies to date also concerning the of the content i found this to be acceptable to a much larger audience than any of the previous american pie movies i thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience when the movie first came out i read a number of negative reviews and ended up not going to see it while it was still in the theater i now regret that decision the movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot dialog scripting and overall quality i give it two thumbs way up,1
2705,i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand br br but there are exceptions i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast forward button for large chunks of the story those movies are the mighty gorga night of the seagulls and this little crap deep blood br br in the world of jaws ripoffs this falls off the scale deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent nor the commentary of tintorera no instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff br br shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange ish paint thrown into the water not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump br br normally i or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool i gotta find a copy of this that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site how wrong i was br br so from one bad movie fan to another let this collect dust on the shelf grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water,0
2706,if this movie would have been in english all critics would have trashed it the language is extremely bad the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts oh on dogs as well the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature av glas that premiered almost at the same time of course the public chose while av glas got little attention br br what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it for fun i suppose the result however is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them this was very frustrating maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master br br another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together at several times in the middle of the movie the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable br br and then i have not mentioned the 2 dimensional characters especially those in the supporting roles br br even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated it is kind of understandable that the public liked it i mean bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses br br i'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it they should have known better br br grade 2 of 10 br br,0
2707,the action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward the plot plods along with few exceptions e g graham greene the acting was uninspired and pedestrian at best the actors seemed to have something on their minds other than the scene they were in it is boring to observe a man driving a car through the semi desert country of this movie's setting whether he drives poorly or well such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video so there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the observer in to make him or her care about the characters and the out comes i am doubly disappointed because i rented this movie based on the reputations of the executive producer redford and the writer of the novel on which it was based hillerman i note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by pbs and the corporation for public broadcasting as well as carlton international i would hope that this video was as disappointing to them as it was to me and my wife to the point that they will not fund any more disasters coming from the same source,0
2708,move over manos back off boogens it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires for the rest of this tome is now and always will be unless someone makes a sequel to the invader the worst film ever the only horror in this thing is watching it i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie if this was the case the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie it's dreck no wait i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck ulli lommel of boogey man fame would call it uber dreck or it should be used to torture prisoners if you find it on a shelf in a video store back away from it quietly and notify the authorities,0
2709,you don't have to be a to appreciate this gem of a movie i don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but i could make out the story because the lead actors and actresses emoted really well and the little girl was really cute she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies the story is really touching and hats off to mr for trying something different the relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically i could identify with the characters in the movie it was a movie that will remain in my heart forever and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends also the songs are just out of this world they were beautifully and meaningfully picturised if only i could understand the right meaning of the lyrics,1
2710,this film sucks a big one so many holes in the plot if the devil is invincible why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards i couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears takes their entire armoury and disappears again nice work if you can get it it's sad that the last 1 2 hour has to result in the standard arnie finale arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film dreadfully scripted arnie is called etc for 95 of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of jericho cane where do they get these names from the ending is so twee you'd better get the barf bag ready shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100 more class br br,0
2711,this one is about a homicide detective who battles a couple of young rich kids who have nothing better to do than plan an intricate murder and cover it up they seem to outwit the police force seemingly at will they taunt the detective by planting clues and leading them off on a wild goose chase this one has a decent plot with a few good twists at the end of the movie sandra bullock does a fine job in this one as a woman on the edge not sure of herself and battling her inner demons she can't seem to keep a man in her life especially partners they seem to keep leaving her for some reason altogether this isn't a bad film it keeps you guessing all the way the very shocking ending,1
2712,this film is probably the worst movie i have watched in a very long time the acting is so wooden a door could have done a better job the plot is laughable and shallow and the actual rugby shown is a far cry from reality i still don't get the as portrayed in this poor excuse for entertainment i am not a kiwi but i do know that the can only be performed by someone of origin and not by an all american white boy br br i am assuming that this was made for the american audience so the shallowness and disney end' is excusable but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an american football game and gets everyone playing rugby instead the only thing good about this film were the end credits it would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into your eyeballs,0
2713,the mission to see the movie the cave was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave some young cave divers and not much else it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did br br the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature what's he going to look like why does he live in a cave how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic the cave demons do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien resurrection and even has the sight of predator shame that's a total ripoff br br well let's look at the plot very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks chiseled guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film makers are biased to a certain viewpoint totally been done and i'm totally tired of it br br the other main problem was the ending as if to say there might be a sequel shoot me if there is one the tagged on ending made me wretch br br i gave this movie 3 10 stars the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature builders for their high quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within even when they looked totally ripped off and there's an interesting yet labored documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before and it was better the first time,0
2714,but like the disney film of two generations ago this film fails as well in the accuracy department but at least disney used a skye terrier br br is the true story to mundane for movie producers i don't think so there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through br br some day a movie will correctly portray bobby's owner john gray as the edinburgh policeman that he was and correctly portray bobby's license a being paid for by the lord when that happens i'll be at the theaters,0
2715,talk about false advertising what was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place i think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie i can appreciate black comedy but this had only the blackness without any comedy the movie was generally disturbing and un funny yes kevin spacey was good as buddy and the rest of the cast was also good but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for guy whaley to lose his mind so badly the ending was disappointing as well what would buddy's motivation be for letting guy get away with what he did this isn't really explained at all why would buddy go for such a plan wouldn't it be more like buddy to screw guy completely by turning him over to the police the ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how i looked at it br br generally i disliked the film despite the good acting spacey essentially chews scenery for most of the film but towards the end he gives buddy a bit of needed humanity the story just wasn't as good as the cast,0
2716,this movie without doubt is the best i have seen and really shows what british talent can do it's effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th century and all the grittiness and disgusting filth of england at the time is captured very well the character's are developed and fleshed out from whoring antics to his development into highwayman and 'the gentleman contrast well with robert carlyle who's cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos i quote got more honour in his little finger than any of you fat bastards ' br br not referring to you of course but it has arguably the most stirring and emotionally charged scene ever witnessed in a movie but you'll just have to see it to find out suffice to say that it involves rope round your neck br br,1
2717,this review is for the uk dvd three disc box set disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior chasing jamie and fast and curious disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special falling in lust again and love potion no 10 the final disc is called anything goes and contains she's the boss and legally yours why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material br br each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe lauren hayes reading a letter from a satisfied customer we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines for instance model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel she's the boss is about a put upon male secretary dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised much to her pleasure all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex br br it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything and as usual we get loud music during the sex action finally the end credits mention the palm hotel singer island florida although my map of florida shows no singer island the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release 4 stars,0
2718,this movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns among the passengers is convicted serial killer richard riddick vin diesel and his nemesis johns cole hauser while the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings an eclipse of all three suns happens shortly afterwards scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one during the eclipse riddick comes into his own as his eyeballs have been surgically shined giving him night vision the crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety br br this is a very stylish film with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene giving it a very strange look vin diesel is brilliant as riddick truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat there is also an underlying humour in his performance as well which adds another dimension to the character this is the sort of role that vin excels in the anti hero whos character is not as one dimensional as first appears i can imagine no one else in this role it could have been written specifically for him br br roll on chronicles of riddick,1
2719,i couldn't believe this was the same director as antonia's line br br this film has it all a boring plot disjointed flashbacks a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever and totally uninteresting characters it was painful to watch soooo painful,0
2720,i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it a waste of money a waste of time very little dialog the dialog was hard to understand in every way the storyline and plot were both weak the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography br br the characters were interesting at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out because of the lack of dialog that you will be rewinding the movie a lot br br do not watch this movie it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess br br you will say what the heck was that when the movie ends,0
2721,ya know what family guy started out as something fresh funny and more original the random humor used to be funny i actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to the simpsons after watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks i grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny south park was right about dead on when they brought up the manatees and the idea balls br br and watching the show itself i don't understand why my parents like it so much there's nothing great about it the humor is funny and would've been funnier if the show didn't rely on randomness,0
2722,i've heard people compare this movie to sideways how this comparison was made i'll never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to sideways br br these 2 films were as different as star wars and the the only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subject br br though the interviews in this documentary were semi interesting they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work ever attempted i've never seen worse camera work in my life and i'm comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year olds br br i give this two stars only for the interesting interviews with french wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the american wine companies are aren't all companies pushy and corrupt i'd give it 10 stars yes that's negative 10 for the deplorable terrible horrible awful vertigo inducing 5 year old could do better camera mess,0
2723,homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap up to a well written well directed and well acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life like look at life and death in baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly retained that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city,1
2724,straight to video and with good reason its like the neighborhood kids putting on a play in the backyard but worse a young man don inherits a farm in west virginia that has been dormant for generations he decides to take a few friends to check the property out this farmland used to produce good corn crops even during the great depression the secret being that the owner was murdering folks and watering the fields with their blood then hang their bodies out as scarecrows the special effects are pretty lame and the the horrible dialog is full of unfunny one liners and the banter so ridiculous the sound may better be turned off cheap gore and a sham of a horror flick along with in the cast jeanie cheek b w york booty and jessica,0
2725,okay you saw the film and i saw the film true if not there are plenty of plot summaries out there and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any feeble attempts of mine to create another br br the most stunning aspect of the film is unquestionably the performances by the two young men and the young lady in the leads their emotional honesty was as compelling if not more so than any performances i've seen in recent months i found i laughed cried and cringed right along with them and that's saying a great deal because i'm often called a jaded and cynical jerk br br as one would expect the story is rife with clichés and i suppose that's the achilles heel of the picture it's a story we've all seen many times before we all know how it will end from the moment they introduce rory though you may not know exact mechanics you know there will be a transformative friendship a bittersweet romance and a gut wrenching conclusion if it weren't for the strong cast and directing this film would be nothing more than the soporific swill that comprises eighty percent of the hallmark channel's program schedule,1
2726,it's funny how time went by and never saw this movie 'till last week when i was like under a spell i saw it twice in a week and it still wasn't enough it's a great movie and i will love to see it again the story is great and it really moved me i would love to live such a story the actors are great the music too and you can dream about your own love story i just hope that someday i will find the opportunity to learn to dance like johnny and baby i feel like dance connects people and brings them together i think people should learn to dance it helps a lot especially in a relationship it's great to feel the dance in your blood and in your body,1
2727,the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it but i soon learned that i had been duped i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip american pie deal but i was wrong this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building go out and get or road trip instead i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this don't buy it don't rent it don't waste 2 hours of your life on this,0
2728,at first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have the first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave but while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then one year went by until i saw this movie in a not free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too i saw it once twice until 200 times and not kidding i did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored and i have to say that i'm not used to see a movie more than twice the act is very good gerard depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too i would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it on balance it's a movie i can't take out of my mind,1
2729,there have been many excellent comments about this movie and i want to add my voice to the praise yul brynner has never been more powerfully attractive his major was riveting your eyes just cannot leave the screen when he's on it this is his movie this is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially deborah kerr and anne jackson as they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances for example i have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time i noticed the reaction of the german girl when she came face to face with a russian soldier even though he was not threatening her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in germany after wwii and was most likely gang raped by the red army the possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again please put it on dvd,1
2730,this documentary traces the origins and life of the skateboard team using original film shot in the 1970s mostly by craig combined with interviews of the team members and other influential people today br br the first part of the film documents how the dogtown section of venice ca came to be starting back around the turn of the century when the town was created to be a venice italy like european city by the 1970's the one remaining local attraction the pacific ocean park had been abandoned leaving a beach with lots of exposed piers and other hazards the poor kids living in the area had nothing better to do than surf and they excelled despite or perhaps because of their surroundings because the waves dissipated in the afternoon they took up skateboarding to fill their time and the empty swimming pools caused by the drought during those years plus their surfing backgrounds led them to create the vertical skateboarding style that is mainstream today br br i found that the film covered much more about surfing than i expected which seemed like a bonus since i really didn't know much about surfing or skateboarding before i watched the film the soundtrack not surprisingly was good as well i also liked how these kids were just following their passion and generally ended up better off for the experience the parts that didn't work so well for me were the drama that they tried to create which seemed somewhat forced and the team's somewhat sense of self importance although this is probably just left over street attitude from where they grew up this is not to say that they didn't have significant influence but only that it seems extremely likely that there were other factors as well br br one note my wife is more affected than most to nausea when films use what we refer to as wiggling camera movements this film is often guilty so if you are so afflicted be warned br br i would recommend this film to anyone but especially to anyone with skateboarding and or surfing in their history br br seen on 5 11 2002,1
2731,sigh what can i say br br why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly br br to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too such fanciful editing only appears in trailers it cheapens the whole look br br and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie who is the guy being tortured is he with the cia br br this film deserved not to be released in theatre but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place its a joke to hollywood,0
2732,brained stupidity that the cartoon bullwinkle made fun of a quarter century beforehand no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie the manchurian candidate without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder the acting barely registers on the cable access tv scale the plot is less nuanced than an old sgt rock comic and only boris j style bad guy mustaches are missing from the commies this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with thumbs,0
2733,talk about awful do not waste your time i wish i had seen the other use comments first br br i have to admit i didn't watch the whole thing it was just too horrible the worst dialogue i could go on and on but what really made it unwatchable was the direction the poor actors you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance br br this would not even be good as a made for tv flick br br ouch,0
2734,sally and saint anne is a very funny movie the first time my mom told me about it i was 7 and saint anne had just been the saint i had for my communion saint my mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her i did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny aunt bea from the andy griffith show was in it and sally's grandfather was the guy who played santa claus in miracle on 34th street so there were lots of actors we seen on tv shows too there is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and sally keeps trying things with st anne to help raise money so they can keep the house that includes a boxing match with hugh o'brian who plays her older brother this is a good and funny movie that i still love,1
2735,like a lot of people i loved the original american graffiti was one of the great movies of the 70s the sequel more american graffiti is a horrible depressing mess of a movie it wasn't funny the wide eyed likable characters had become cynical and jaded and the stories were contrived such as laurie's character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and terry the toad and pharaoh joe somehow managing to serve together in vietnam they even have a police officer by the name of harrison ford's character in the original who makes a cameo he doesn't even look like harrison ford who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage br br the operative word here is funny this movie isn't even amusing debbie candy clark is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail steve and laurie ron howard and cindy williams the lovebirds in the original have two kids and have become an annoying bickering couple adorable little tomboy carol mackenzie phillips has become rainbow yet another hippie child john milner paul is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original even wolfman jack whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a great flow only is heard sporadically br br perhaps it was different writers a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure br br the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie american graffiti was and avoid the movie with more in the title,0
2736,first off i've read the comments by the director further down and i'd like to thank him for offering his opinion i've always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on mst3k felt about their works being shredded not to mention how best brains acquired the rights comments make me curious however as to how much sci fi could have cut the film to make it seem different now i'm thinking i might rent it from netflix of course i've never seen the uncut non mst3k version of this film but even having seen it on mst3k i never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable though i did think it was a pretty funny mst3k episode certainly not as pearl describes it skin awful not after seeing the likes of future war and hobgoblins br br as far as cutting the film it's been done before on mst3k at least once case in point the joe don baker flick mitchell in which the subplot involving john saxon's character is cut in the mst3k version yet joel and the bots comment on saxon's absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie if i may submit a criticism of mst3k if you need to cut the film for time considerations fine but be fair to the film being cut even if it is a film as lousy as mitchell of course such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over but i think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair but anyway if it's the case with it gets my sympathies br br still i maintain that it's an enjoyable mst3k episode though the movie itself even the version that's been hacked in mst3k is no where near terrible br br as a final note in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of synchronicity i happened to watch the hudsucker proxy the day aired and wouldn't you know it the guy who played vivian father had a bit part in that movie one of his three other credited roles actually i thought that was kind of weird,0
2737,i have seen this movie only once several years ago but i remember liking it a lot br br spoilers ahead an old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune he puts knockout drops in their milk when they wake up they find themselves miles away they must journey back to their house before it is too late with the help of an independent minded tomcat and other animal accomplices while evading the butler and foiling his plan br br could have been better but it also could have been a lot worse br br my score 7 10,1
2738,just go see this movie it taps into everything awesome about rock and roll the band comes up with some great songs pick of destiny master etc all this with the humor of d makes this the best movie ever br br the cameos are great right of the back with meat loaf and dio singing to jb ben stiller and tim robbins are great i really like tim robbins character you also find out who satan really is the music and musical references are hilarious and awesome songs great songs from the who dio and others just complete it i personally didn't think the band could top the awesome songs of the d but they did with songs like and master seriously awesome music br br just go see it its a must for anyone who loves rock,1
2739,historically awful scarcely an accurate moment in 4 hours of one cannot keep track of the inconsistencies while watching as with all track and filed movies nobody bothers to ask for any track consultants events and techniques that weren't even created until the next century are shown from the shots of runners jogging in a 400 meters to the highly overweight actor portraying the high jump and long jump winner one would have to know absolutely nothing about track to even be mildly entertained likely thrown together in 1984 as a tribute to the games just prior to the la olympics,0
2740,ah how refreshing to see a vision of 18th century england complete with mud the pox and and accompanied by a delightful techno soundtrack to boot this is the story of downtrodden highwayman robert carlisle and gentleman fallen on hard times captain jonny lee miller and how they get together and rob the pigs is a hard nut but is far too polite for that and thus becomes 'the gentleman he falls in love with lady rebecca liv tyler who to be frank is the only weak part of the whole shebang and wants to impress her br br the costumes are fantastic big colourful historically beautiful togs alan cummings gets all the best threads and the best lines as lord rochester sporting a very non 18th century eyebrow piercing the music shifts between swooping glorious choirs and thumping bass laden techno which doesn't as you think it should do in a historical film the script is fast moving and peppered with modern day colloquialisms merchant ivory this is not there are hilarious parts disgusting parts sit on the edge of your seat and nibble your fingernails parts but the whole thing chugs along and is wonderfully entertaining throughout this is cheer in the cinema stuff unmissable,1
2741,for a norris movie this is pretty tame for an action movie it is kind of dull and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies but come on the only non predictable move defies the plot and the set up of the editing mainly it is said rather early on that the killer jack o'halloran whom is one of the few slightly known actors only kills women yet he all of a sudden stops his m o and kills men huh i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women br br yet again i'm sure that there is a reason i e to build suspense but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior br br fans of renegade may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous br br,0

2743,if i could have given this film 0 10 i would and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low its worse than awful if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it at least minimum wage some of the camera shots were quite effective but a lot were rubbish eg villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side ways from his body seeing is believing several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions facial expressions when they were shot i only watched it to the end fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat but there was almost none of that should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music end of 'action' scene in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact the chief villain keeps coming back to life he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd 3rd floor onto the street to sum up this film is a total waste of time and a total joke it looks very low budget even for seagal the colour is dull and grey i could go on and on just like this film but i wont watch this film if you've got insomnia its guaranteed to put you to sleep,0
2744,i'm grading this film on a curve in other words it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do this is an excellent t a film i have no idea the count of how many t's or a's were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare t's at one time just to give you an idea there are topless girls all throughout there is a wet t shirt contest scene and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all girl teams and every time one scores a touchdown the entire opposing team losing a piece of clothes i don't know why this gets such a low rating here perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones if you are looking for a good campy t a film i'd recommend this one,1
2745,i read comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture br br i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised br br to address comments br br trail street is a very well done western br br and randolph scott was in it quite a bit br br gabby hayes was funnier than i've ever seen him br br the bad guys had very good as far as i was concerned br br plus br br it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight laced good guy he's usually so slimy br br in all a good western very well acted and written br br i liked the background story of kansas and the winter wheat that supposedly helped it become a state too br br i thought the girl who played susan was lovely can't think why she didn't become a bigger star,1
2746,i find it amazing that so many people probably poles have voted for this movie giving it such grades mostly tens ok the movie was fine funny but it was nothing special on the other hand the only good thing about is the dialogues rather not comprehensive for non poles screenplay is primitive the acting except for jerzy stuhr as awful it's too much ado about nothing fortunately it's not included in the top 250 p s the sequel 2 2 is on the way and it's just the same story,0
2747,i hate you you hate me barney stole your suv with a great big bunch and a kick from me to you wont you say you hate me too jingle bells batman smells grandma had a gun shot barney and made him pee and now there is no more barney the moron now why the heck would come up with a idiotic show like barney so what i'm saying is barney is a retard from the underground world and the kids on this show are like 12 years old if i were them i wouldn't believe this stupid idiot called barney now producers why do you believe this crap that barney says they are always happy that is stupid they should be sad sometimes am i right bottom line barney is so stupid who watches that ugly creature,0
2748,this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship 20 years ago they have all met for a reunion terry plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent d'onofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way it's unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other it's not the best movie i've seen but it's certainly good enough for a viewing,1
2749,well it might be a kid's movie perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm it is teenager movie i agree so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story i think they writers mend a lesson whit it ''the truth is never,1
2750,apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun this film is not worth seeing br br the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it's hard to know what is going on at any given time and just when you think you're following then the direction changes again like a lost bi polar puppy dog br br the musical score is awful relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet  'feel sad here' 'feel shocked here' 'feel scared here' on top of that the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter br br gone are the days of silent film where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice  but you wouldn't think so while watching river queen br br the voice over was so over utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story br br and the stolen ideas from jane campion's the piano are too obvious to overlook not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano  perhaps some of this comes down to alun camera work on the latter  but the voice over feeling and levels too are strikingly close and who could forget when holly hunter's character has her wings clipped in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill does it remind you of when has his amputated and surprisingly too with an axe i thought so br br all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing unless you wear some ear and just go with the scenery in mind,0
2751,original movie lovers can actually love this show if they just stop complaining all the time br br the emperor's new school brings up some old jokes from the movie like pulling the lever to lab and pausing the episode but since it's a kids show it's just classic and is in their right places even though the style is much more simple the animation and characters keeps their personalities very well and it surprised me actually eartha kitt makes excellent voice acting for and j p does a wonderful job for voice instead of david spade who played in the movie great plots hilarious moments and amazing looks makes this show worth watching just stop complaining about everything,1
2752,wow i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in ' this is a phenomenal movie it has action romance suspense intrigue and wit when i wasn't laughing i was at the edge of my seat this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the 18th century this film has everything to keep me happy,1
2753,this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong br br this movie starts really good br br after half of the movie it wraps to a religious christian crap br br some really christian with psycho problems are talking about good and believe in christ or you go to hell br br don't watch it it's pure propaganda and its pure wrong,0
2754,i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you you are alone is that movie for me the film is constantly in my head and in my heart i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again as if i am seeing it for the first time br br there is nothing i did not like about the movie amazing soundtrack the ending was perfect very emotionally stirring it was compelling and riveting br br i adored jessica and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed i admired strength what a strong woman br br the tag line is when your darkest moments come to life we never know what we are capable of doing everyone says oh i would never do that when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part br br thank you for a perfect piece of art,1
2755,i found this movie to be educational entertaining and very moving i was impressed when i learned of just how much justice had contributed in during her time in kosovo br br wendy crewson is highly under rated and it is good to see her again in a canadian production other easily recognizable stars are leslie hope 24 and john corbett sex in the city br br while the story line of this movie may not be completely factual it did leave me with the desire to learn more about the word of a great movie for inspiring young women br br i say the movie is a must see,1
2756,murder over new york is fun but not as good as most of the other fox chans this film would have been better named charlie chan in new york the film's working title this is chance to play chan in the big apple there is a lot to like here though including guest star shemp howard of the three stooges br br this has one of my favorite chan sayings coincidence like ancient egg leave unpleasant toler and yung are good in this one and so is the supporting cast but there is little or no mysterious atmosphere which i look for in these films still it is good to see,1
2757,if you're in the mood to laugh at a truly bad movie bad in the way only ken russell at his worst can be you must try this one it succeeds in making you feel like you just landed in a 25 porn booth and you can just about smell the urine on the floor kathleen turner struts around in a blond wig getting her kicks from pretending to be a two bit hooker she really has a good solid job in the clothing industry and has been hurt so badly by men that this is the only way she can connect and tony perkins plays a hysterical priest who is out to maybe murderer her yet another movie that ends with tony perkins in drag annie potts shows up and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual wit which is reason enough to hate this movie the kinky will love the sex scenes so rent the unrated version in the red box so you can see turner give a cop a taste of his billy club i had to pause the vcr until we stopped laughing,0
2758,i went to the cinema slightly apprehensive i came out seething with anger at the garbage passing for a film i had witnessed the actors particularly travolta should be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this clearly the only thing in their minds was the pay cheque never mind the debasement of their talents and us travolta needs to go back to doing some more look who's talking movies as he has sunk back to the level of his pre tarantino work it comes to something when the l w talking sequels are better than this one travolta is no longer the king of cool but the king of corn michael caine himself admitted to doing bad movies for the pay cheque should follow suit if he has any self respect,0
2759,i have a little hobby of finding really cool pics out there that are pretty much unknown and then letting people know about them this one is on top of my list for getting the word out this summer this indie film and i really mean indie not miramax fox searchlight indie might be easy to overlook in the big maze of celluloid but if you want something completely different you have to check this one out br br basically i thought it was totally great i should have known from the dvd cover front and back that this was going to be something totally different but they all say that their stuff is different to hook you well this one really is totally different it's in your face beautiful and scary and unashamed to tell you to wake up war peace 9 11 poetry even a eerie sort of music video set to an old time patriotic song and a weird guy in an rv need i say more just see it,1
2760,gen y cops since i heard of the film being in release i have been wanting to see it because i loved gen x cops i was a little disappointed that a nicholas tse didn't return and b too much slapstick nevertheless i enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film but it is good in its own way br br stephen fung returns as the ladies man match who has a steady girl in note where is haze and sam lee returns as the insane alien this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of english the real star of the film is newcomer edison chen he makes a great replacement for nicholas tse as edison i also enjoyed paul rudd's performance of agent curtis he seems to be the tough as nails fbi agent you'd love to hate but soon you'd like his character br br the fight scenes are a lot better in this one even though there are very few but they are great courtesy of jackie chan stuntman nicky li br br look for a cameo from ron as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with match also is the stunt double for rudd br br if you liked gen x cops you'll love gen y cops,1
2761,imaginary heroes the remarkable work of the then 24 year old dan harris is tag lined people are never who they seem to be perhaps this is wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing yet i rented this movie in spite of the tag line rather than because of it and i'm glad i did i found the move an insightful examination of tragedy i personally found it to be a movie about coping with dreams particularly those which are lost in the case of one son loss requires deep examination of what he had and didn't have in his life yet the central tragedy of the movie while posing enticing questions in its own right acts primarily as the backdrop against which different coping styles are set into relief i believe the film inquires into an important question how do we cope with our dreams particularly where heroes become imaginary,1
2762,written by someone who has been there you can tell but only if you've been there excellent performances by meryl streep of course renee zellweger and william hurt br br many people have said that it is about a dysfunctional family i think every family is dysfunctional when they are facing this kind of torment to not be dysfunctional would be dysfunctional you are losing your family as you know it can anything be worse people need to see this movie so when they are faced with this nightmare maybe they will change how they do it maybe they will see that the father is denying himself valuable time he'll never get a chance at again maybe they will realize how hard it is to die or to watch someone you love die they didn't miss much of the nightmare it's hard to forget,1
2763,glen or glenda was edward d wood jr's first attempt at directing a feature film for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart transvestism the art of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes to his credit wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953 unfortunately wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film br br the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glen glenda daniel davis aka ed wood inspector warren lyle talbot with the help of psychiatrist dr alton timothy farrell tries to understand why a man would want to live and die this way br br glen is engaged to barbara dolores fuller and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession and that's it we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window poor old bela who was down on his luck and befriended by wood keeps popping in throughout the story i'm not 100 sure but i think bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed br br to add to the confusion of lugosi's narration farrell as dr alton also provides off screen narration lugosi keeps saying take care take care as well as some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails br br the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and wood's character s the dream sequences are laughable a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination risqué for 1953 br br this film along with wood's other classics were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years for that reason they have survived to this day,0
2764,im usually wary of movies hovering around the 6 10 mark on imdb id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of hey if i liked types of movies like these would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i don't like these types of movies then again people judge differently basing more value on acting or perhaps story or directing anyway landing the plane here i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it this morning i did br br wow see this movie i am personally interested in the paranormal have read a bit about near death experiences so automatically i was hooked i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted i disagree the acting here was superb from all i think this is the only time i didn't mind julia roberts it was good to see kiefer sutherland currently at the time of this review serving a jail sentence for dui and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair style br br overall i liked the direction the atmosphere the acting and the story line most of all particularly the idea of karma and to quote nelson wright everything we does matters so true br br 10 10,1

2766,i watched the first few moments on tcm a few years ago but stopped after about 15 minutes i saw it listed on the schedule at the stanford theatre in palo alto and i vowed i would make the 40 minute drive the stanford is an old fashioned movie house that starts each movie with the curtains still shut yes they have curtains they opened as the fox logo fanfare began to play when the best of everything appeared in huge pink letters spread against the new york city skyline i knew i was right for waiting br br i lapped this movie up there were so many little moments that added to the look and feel of the movie when hope lange walks into the publishing office for the first time the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass the teenager and elegance joan crawford's swanky apron that she wore so she could serve her guests at her party without her outfit the way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy suzy parker was becoming it was almost sideways at one point how hope lange kept living at that dumpy flat she shared with the others even though she obviously was making a lot more money than at the beginning of the film guess it was too scandalous for a single gal to live alone br br hope lange was so beautiful so was suzy parker and how about mark goddard in a non speaking role i fell in love with him when i was a kid watching lost in space br br seeing this gem on the big screen prompted me to plan another trek down to the stanford to see the old dark house incidentally i bought a small soda and popcorn at the concession stand and i was taken aback when the worker asked me for two bucks,1
2767,i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim shown on the bed with the missing eyelids as the camera pans up and away from her face blinks yes blinks i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things of course after that it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body face too bad,0
2768,this movie is breath taking and mind blowing but i think maybe it can only be appreciated by die hard rpg it is like a game one problem is the plot is too game like and just has too many twists the twists are excessive jude law gives a very good performance i really like him in this movie just as jerome in gattaca and joe in a i,1
2769,i give this piece of hollywood trash 1 out 10 seriously i mean i like comedy as much as the next guy i also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it but this film had nothing to laugh at or with br br i like nearly all of the actors in this film so i thought i'd overlook what many people told me about it my fault for not listening i was just mortified at how stupid this script was just ridiculous and not even in a funny way the only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on tv i was very disappointed and i really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it bad decision on their parts br br major spoiler br br okay here's my biggest question on this film if the characters are looking back on this story of jewel liv tyler after the fact then how can paul reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past he dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster can anyone answer me that major goof on the part of the film makers nobody noticed this,0
2770,congo is probably the worst big budget movie of the 1990s it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again a bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest africa where they encounter a temple of riches just like in king solomon's mines but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches on their side the humans have a talking gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another so much for the plot the dialogue throughout is witless the acting almost uniformly atrocious certainly campy tim curry and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor and the special effects abysmal wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas and the lava oh yes did i mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale laura linney of all people is along for this of rides what could she have been thinking this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear a movie that helped guarantee her stardom,0
2771,you don't have to be a notre dame football fan to enjoy this because i am not but as a football fan in general this was fun to watch it almost makes me a fighting irish devotee if you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film gridiron fan or not you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes br br as a sports fan i loved watching the classic footage of early college games they had some pretty wild plays back then with a lot of they interspersed that footage with pat o'brien shown as head coach on the sidelines and some of the players such as george ronald reagan br br reagan gets pretty good billing in this film but his part really isn't that large o'brien is the only actor with a large role in here the rest all playing nice characters include gale page as wife bonnie donald crisp as the notre father john callahan albert as chemistry professor father and reagan as perhaps notre most talented and famous player ever br br what this film does nicely is balance the personal story with the football neither angle is overdone the characters in here all people you can root for as there are no villains on my last look it was interesting to discover johnny sheffield tarzan's son playing at the age of seven and to see george reeves tv's superman as one of the players br br there have been very few football movies made in hollywood for some reason and precious few good ones this is one of them,1
2772,oh man this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while br br it started out new exciting and fresh and i really liked it then was a good female role model for the show and inu yasha was funny and hot headed br br then it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed and i'll tell y'all the reasons why warning spoiler alert br br okay they basically destroy inu relationship with early on by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend who's drippy sappy and a total waste of time br br they introduce a pervert named who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show which really bugged me 'cause it was out of place and stupid then they introduce a demon slayer named whose only purpose in life is to try and fail to save her brainwashed brother br br the big bad of the show while starting out as a really good bad guy lost his touch after a while he got pretty old pretty fast and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything br br the characters all became wooden and unemotional and then the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there nothing happened never got killed or defeated and inu yasha never fully fell in love 'cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick plot holes were left open the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed and nothing changed in the plot i mean they dragged it out to over 150 episodes and nothing changed in the plot at all and they expected me as well as other fans of the show to be satisfied i was disenchanted disgusted and annoyed as crap i at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series instead all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga br br seriously if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that i strongly recommend that show progresses and goes somewhere plus it has really good animation too br br but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime as best as you can,0
2773,the first bottom movie was an absolute laugh from the beginning excellently made and thought out i will definitely take my hat off to the production team and the actors the bottom actors attempt to run a hotel if you look closely this film was most probably shot in the isle of wight near my home,1
2774,one of the best western movies ever made unfortunately it never got the recognition it deserved the storyline the action and the music was in my mind one of the best i give it a double a randolph scott gave a terrific performance along with the other members of the cast the ending was one of the best of any western made,1
2775,this film was incredible looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an indie the most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by david mark hildreth and paul anthony who plays the main role he carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth br br the cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly it wasn't very realistic in that way but it didn't have to be to make a larger point it was really great seeing alan cumming in this too the script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting i've seen in a while br br go see this,1
2776,i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough curious to see what the general movie opinionated public thought of this movie i looked it up on this site i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great i needed to have my say and here it is this movie is absolute garbage it was a chore to sit through the jokes were uninspired rehashes from other better shows and movies and leguizamo's manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below that actually may be a stretch even for that age i'm all for slapstick ridiculousness but there isn't even the faintest hint of wit or cleverness i have an idea lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed now that's funny ha ha br br movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality the marx brothers' a night at the opera monty python's the meaning of life south park bigger longer and uncut and the list goes on don't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap br br by the way i can only assume that the reason that david bar katz the other writer did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly blacklisted i'm actually impressed that leguizamo was able to recover after this mess,0
2777,if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen there are different aspects a sports movie can take whether it be professional or college or high school examples of sports movies i liked and i haven't seen many are jim all american all the right moves any given sunday eight men out and rocky among others all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach or the effect of money on professional sports in hoosiers there is not much content it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end there was no character development all of them were forced on us i could sum up this movie by quoting a very bad coach go out and try to score more points than the other guy,0
2778,this movie has to be seen for the music which is actually a wonderful composed by sergei obviously the original soundtrack is not exactly hi fi but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections the can be appreciated for itself but having seen the movie helps br br the story itself is fairly standard soviet wartime anti german propaganda an amusing anecdote is that stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing hitler at the onset of world war ii that eisenstein was to a german movie for a short while as penance br br prince alexander nevsky revered as a saint by the russian orthodox having earned his nickname by defeating swedish raiders on the river neva musters russian resistance against an invasion by the teutonic knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would be invaders br br an interesting scene alexander sees a convoy of russians being taken as slaves by mongolian soldiers and does nothing to stop this as the teutonic knights are his priority the historical alexander nevsky paid tribute to the mongol khans as his father before him while working to consolidate his future independence,1
2779,firstly this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book short story novella or anything else from web site and their review on the show when it first aired he never writes down to his audience and he never betrays contempt for his subjects his first original work for television stephen king's cbs july 16 9 11 p m is no exception br br the series was apparently going to be as others have mentioned an ongoing series which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends br br when the series came out on videotape it touted itself as having the never before seen ending it should have said the should never be seen ending br br spoiler br br the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video though parts of the whole were left out and that changed ending was what destroyed the story for example rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop as originally broadcast jude simply walks up to them and they shoot him bang dead and no real emotion to speak of in the scene ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff hanger on the video they simply get out of the cock a car br br end spoiler br br it was a sad ending to a rather well made mini series and makes the video completely not worth buying or even renting sincerely save your money and your time,0
2780,i know one is not supposed to comment on other comments but i will say that a lot of the negative reviews seem to come from people who already knew quite a lot about the manhattan project and were annoyed at things that were left out from his book in it appears the original screenwriter bruce robinson is another such i knew very little before watching the film however and found it dwight schultz is absolutely mesmeric as oppenheimer a truly magnetic charismatic presence an inspired piece of casting that makes me wonder why he isn't given better roles and more leading parts john cusack and paul newman are excellent as always one could quibble with various script or direction choices but as it is the film is extremely intense and horrific at times and overall i give it four stars out of five,1
2781,coen brothers wannabe from writer director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other better movies yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist ha ha who goes on a killing spree in the desert the film is unusual but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience it becomes alienating and off putting with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating an admittedly bravura finale many quirky bits of business and forster looking great in the nude make this a curiosity item nothing more veteran movie director irvin kershner produced and maybe should directed as well could paul chart be a pseudonym 1 2 from,0
2782,i had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the miami film festival this past saturday and let me just say i was astounded it was the only film out of the whole program that i loved it is beautifully shot composed edited acted and written after the screening i saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next he said that he was working on finding financing for the feature version of the short he described some scenes to me it sounded like the kind of first film that launches the greats into the industry if you ever get a chance to see this short i highly recommend taking it hats off to star crossed,1
2783,my age 13 br br keats played by damon wayans and archie moses played by adam sandler are the best of friends and have been for a year what moses doesn't know is that keats is really jack carter an undercover cop who is waiting for the right time to bust moses and frank colton a major criminal who moses is involved with when colton and moses find out that keats is a cop colton wants to kill moses but he gets away after shooting carter in the head which does not kill carter moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of colton's wrongdoing but when the cops including carter are about to escort him across the country on a plane all the other cops are killed and moses and carter are alone in the desert carter has to stay alive as well as take moses in br br a fairly average action comedy bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid for a comedy i found most of the jokes entirely unfunny but as an action movie it has a few fairly good action scenes not being a good fan of either adam sandler or damon wayans i found the acting and therefore the characters well below par the climax isn't really great and the film is so unrealistic it is not entirely bad but also not too good and it is far too short running below 85 minutes i though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended but there wasn't and the film felt too short overall not a complete waste of time but i still wouldn't recommend bulletproof br br australian classification ma 15 medium level violence sexual references medium level coarse language br br rating 56 out of 100,0
2784,spike milligan was one of the funniest men i've ever seen and a huge influence on my life br br this movie is limp and awful and does his memory no credit the script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact the leg jokes here are incomprehensible the actors' performances are uniformly ineffective a great cast wasted and the lead sean hughes delivers milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine which misses the point completely br br the gentle pacing is a killer as well farce should accelerate towards the end the goon shows often did the novel definitely did but this film if anything slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax br br milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of in 1980 with t p mckenna dermot kelly norma ronald and jack hobbs now that's funny ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film i believe the lp was transferred to cd but don't know if it's still in print br br there is a movie of adolf hitler my part in his downfall with jim dale and arthur lowe it too is a godawful mess but it's funnier than this thing br br it's possible that milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen the other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking this film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint,0
2785,warning spoilers ahead even if i doubt that anybody hasn't seen this yet br br the movie starts off rather well but about halfway through it falls apart and becomes a corny sugary sweet predictable and unrealistic romance' mess i mean it's very obvious that there are serious problems in the main characters' marriage but these problems are never solved but just forgotten br br basically as soon as she decides to have a baby behind his back without even asking all of their problems magically disappear without a trace or an explanation given what had happened up until that moment it would have been far more logical if the marriage fell apart rather than becoming the trite and cliche' 'having a baby will change ending br br the two main characters' families and neighbours are also extremely one dimensional and don't seem to serve really any purpose if not to irritate the viewer and they also mysteriously disappear from the movie as soon as the moments' start br br i am sorry to be ripping this movie but given the start i would have expected something more 4 10 for me,0
2786,corny and some really bad acting but for a golan globus film about right on par saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films what was i thinking arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord there is also bergman who was in the original conan movie as valeria here she plays the evil queen an obvious camp to her conan role and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen ernie reyes as prince who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed what a little irritating some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks special effects are cheap and look very 70's like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie br br overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness,0
2787,i'll give it this i didn't stop watching and it's not corporate which is kind of cool but my internal critic cut it to pieces i suppose i see too many movies wooden script the slang just sort of out of their mouths without any kind of flow editing mentioned before is hit and miss sometimes it evokes a good ghetto feel but mostly its irritating jerky quirky angles and really dull lingering facial closeups the actors were marginal though had her moments br br i'm not sure why the audience supposed to care about curtis he's a total screwup and the actor is entirely expressionless and not particularly funny or endearing the directing doesn't help make you love him or hate him even i just wanted him to shut up and get shot already i didn't care about his impotent vengeance when that rolled around the completely predictable ending isn't credible at all i'm not sure why we're supposed to believe that some erstwhile successful dealers he are stupid enough to fall for his petty scams oh you just got out of jail and are on probation here's thousands of dollars worth of cocaine go run it around the corner for me now don't steal from me etc br br a good sex scene in the beginning gave me hope but it was let down in the end handling of a rape scene was slightly eyebrow raising if only mildly interesting there are better movies in this genre that don't insult your intelligence by trying for some kind of authentic ghetto realism while more resembling a film school offering 4 10 an f,0
2788,this film was bad was it meant to be a comedy as i couldn't help laughing the whole way through it what a waste of two hours donald sutherland was wooden not that he was alone everyone else was just as bad and how miscast was linda hamilton,0
2789,i can't believe that i let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this april 14 2007 this movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and sickly boring i haven't even felt the gory impact of its daunting scenes which i deem to be complete failure to attract its audience the worst even trampled me cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy assisting her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate lodge to stay in for one night i wasn't really disappointed with that matter but this movie is a matter indeed for me poor plot useless storyline naively created and i don't know what to say anymore br br the title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to overture us viewers maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real situational play good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway,0
2790,i am a fan of slasher movies especially of scream 1 3 but this one is just one killing after another to my astonishment part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self ironical first part 1 out of 10 second part 4 out of 10,0
2791,an unusual movie which starts off with the classic premise of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves him in order to escape the country but a twist soon turns the tale upside down most of the film hits the right buttons the story develops smoothly acting is solid sienna miller's drawl is priceless she really can act chemistry between both leads works and rolling american rural scapes and quirky side characters really make for a good time the mood which starts off as light and romantic soon moves into something darker and downright eery at times br br at times though the pace slows just a tad more than we would like but don't let this stop you watching this unusual little cinematic treat alexandre paris,1
2792,it's amazing that this no talent actor got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal pathetic cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as dunaway wagner keach tilly and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film i doubt many people have ever heard of and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs,0
2793,i've seen the beginning of the muppet movie but just the half because i only watched it at mrs kelly's friend's house the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious they learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow anyone can make it no matter how small no matter how green which was included in the trailer br br kermit is my favorite protagonist which means it describes the main character and so are the other muppets mel brooks was amazing when he played professor max the scene where miss piggy saves kermit by doing kung fu on those guys it was so cool br br the muppet movie is the best jim henson film with the most hilarious characters and people will cherish for his successful film,1
2794,this film has a premise that is good enough to get anyone talking and a sure fire conversation starter you sleep with someone you dislike or don't know for one million dollars ' while the film had lots of potential poor execution turns it into a b grade soap opera the film has a great lead up and after the proposal is made we are really into the film but then it falls dramatically the last 3 quarters of the film is spent by characters whinging complaining and regretting what they have done the ending was so cliched it had me in tears this has a very similar premise to in vegas' which is far better see that instead,0
2795,this film just won the best film award at the cleveland international film festival it's american title apparently is autumn spring the acting is superb the story takes you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and spikes it up a little bit abetted by his best friend and partner in not so serious crime he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold his wife has come to her wits end and makes a life changing decision which is heartbreaking to watch the resolution of the story is beautiful,1
2796,when dirty dancing was on tv in the middle of last year i was out so i didn't get to see it my mum swore that i had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere anyway getting to the point she couldn't find her video so for christmas i bought her the dvd well she hasn't had a look in it sat around for a while then one night i decided to take it upstairs to watch and i fell in love with it this is a great film with lots of lovely scenes i love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it it's definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch dirty dancing again and again dirty dancing the way love is meant to be,1
2797,this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african centric over the top airliner they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport one day this guy wins 100 million dollars a the next time you see him he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport everyone calls this movie a parody but nothing about this movie shouts parody this movie is a flop and will forever be in the 4 95 bin at wal mart br br i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie this movie doesn't even warrant straight to video status the writers one black and one white should be blackballed from hollywood forever not only do they over stereotype blacks they portray them as ignorant human beings i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me don't waste your time at the video store wal mart pay per view or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs,0
2798,it is important to realise that eisenstein was a committed marxist film maker who held some very specific and particular theories about what film could achieve and how br br it is simply idle to compare alexander nevsky negatively with anything from a similar period in the us this film comes from the oldest film school in the world from another continent from an entirely different approach to cinema br br to appreciate this film a little more try finding out about and theories of montage for example or read the wikipedia entry on marxist film theory if you're feeling really bold you might even investigate the forms of dialectic br br it follows that if you watch this film without some understanding of eisenstein's ideas and ideals you probably won't get it in alexander nevsky the main characters aren't playing themselves they are meant to be of their nation's character nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown larger than life because they represent stylised heroic aspects of the entire russian people br br the acting isn't wooden it's meant to be slightly mannered it represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic narrative style which hollywood was rapidly adopting eisenstein's films are especially designed not to be realistic if anything seems somewhat obvious whether lighting or language or a pose struck by an actor it's meant to be that way eisenstein was one of the early of film as an art form not just as entertainment br br if the editing sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images well that's the idea shots are meant to contrast with each other eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political philosophical argument namely marxist dialectic br br so sit back shout hurrah for russia and her folk hero defenders boo at the cowardly nobles and the teuton invaders and enjoy the difference,1
2799,just a few words it's a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these people's sentiments yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave to vote oh and one of them finishes off the doctor from startrek voyager that's about as scary as it will get people if you are looking for a horror movie i suggest you keep on looking and if you are looking for a witty political satire you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror but don't let me hold you back maybe you see something i've missed though chances are you'll be wasting your time with it just as i have let's just say i prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing in of the camera,0
2800,this is a haunting short film both james franco and rachel miner deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you since this is called a tragic story this isn't much of a spoiler but i wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because i had already come to care about these people i can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me beautifully shot acted edited high caliber work all around even to the use of just the right sound and or music to advance the story the end credit song finished the job wringing even more emotion from me this is first rate from beginning to end kudos to the writer director and all involved br br this is my first review of a film in the comments section i promised to do so in exchange for a copy of the dvd the review could be good or bad just my honest opinion this is it and it's the least i can do i am so glad i got to see it,1
2801,early 1950s sci fi directed by lesley special effects of course are very primitive but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then drive in movie double feature fare still interesting enough to watch two leading men arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot cameron mitchell are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford virgina huston another scientist and two other space experts richard gaines and john litel upon landing on the red planet the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced in actuality the martians are led by morris who has the idea of conquering earth to their civilization there is a beautiful martian chapman that dr barker intends to take back on the return trip she is the movie's redeemable element,0
2802,i first saw this movie in a queer film festival 10 minutes after the movie ended a gay couple walked up to me and asked me whether i needed help i was still sitting crying like a maniac the movie is cheesy it's bizarre it's over the top it's gay but it is amazing i do think that every character is plausible character is mean to a woman who only tries to help he brutally throws his terrible friends out he does have a temper he can harm a fly the fly that killed the love of his life doubly so bates is a miracle she is perfect just like a role a woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the homosexual lover of her idol is to me the essence of true love i even understand max the husband he is bored with his life he's got a midlife crisis he moves out tries to lead an exciting life only to realise a that he's the really boring part in the relationship and b that he loves his wife i love the fact that she comes back to him in the end because i think that it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality for in the end he's her husband and he might not be as exciting as victor but he's real he is the man she loves in a very down to earth way i've watched it about 50 times and i do love this film everything about it unconditionally btw just read rupert autobiography and ul is the only film that he talks of as one of the best films he ever made to me it's the best film he ever made,1
2803,then you will be a big fan of this movie its almost the same basic concept a nice mixture of music soul and drama i'll admit i was a little about seeing this movie i had only seen previews of a white trash girl chained to a radiator but i am a big fan of samuel l jackson and i enjoyed hustle flow so i thought i would give it a chance br br i'm very glad that i did it turned out to be more than just the surface story of a nymphomaniac southern girl being imprisoned by a 60 year old black man the story had heart and was very influential br br the music in this movie also added a nice touch craig brewer mixed his style from hustle flow into this movie except took a new spin and used the blues his musical scenes are still at the top of the charts as far as performance scenes go by he also has very interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feel during some of the more controversial scenes br br no doubt if you liked hustle flow you will love this movie and if you are a fan of the blues you should definitely go an see this i give it a 9 out of 10 very interesting film and it is extremely under rated shame br br go out and rent this movie,1
2804,as an english teacher i appreciate films that do more than tell a story good films like good literature cause one to think reflect and predict this film made me do all three mr jansen takes risks and uses foreshadowing symbolism and interesting turning points for many of his characters i also likes the fact that despite the choices the characters make in the film their choices do not seem as adolescent or as other films i have seen the acting is pretty good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other excellent soundtrack with songs you don't hear on the radio it is a reconciling with life spontaneous road trip film that deserves more than just a second glance,1
2805,if you're a fan of turkish and middle eastern music you're in great luck this film is a documentary of current music in istanbul spanning the traditional to the modern it's very good you could not do better if you went to istanbul yourself we get interviews with concert clips of modern musical icons a road show with a gypsy audience turkish hip hop surprisingly very very good and much much more some of the best female i've ever heard a kurdish woman singing in a steam bath who will rip your heart out lots of social and political background if this is your thing you'll have a grand time i could barely sit still in the theatre br br cd soundtrack now available on amazon pricey,1
2806,there is so much wrong with this movie greico with a girls wig old man scientist time machine fixer tough guy jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three rounds spider people with tentacle hands and bad teeth etc the make up was so bad and they only had a few visible spider people on screen at one time aliens cameron technique could have been used instead they chose to dress every spider person the same way badly the nice thing about greico's acting is that he bobs his had at every syllable as if he is counting how many words he gets to speak in the script it amazes me that with all of the information out there on dvd commentaries people like this still exist who make movies this movie could have been worse how i don't know oh and one last thing i am going on a sci fi movie hunt down the people running that channel should not be allowed to procreate to further continue the nepotism that exist in film and television,0
2807,i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo prints his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes br br de merde whoops de mer features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish which is never explained have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies but if that has anything to do with this movie's theme ray neglects to say so i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards which in french manage to include rhymes a pun belle and some br br as so often in ray's work there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie unfortunately the photography is largely so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her i'll rate this mess one point out of 10,0
2808,i was looking for attack on precinct 13 there the film is that memorable who is the star of this ethan hawke or matt dillon i can't tell who the lead actor is that's a pretty big point against the movie right there gabriel byrne who could't have needed the money this badly could he drea de matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body it took me ages to finally work out she's joey's sister off friends i agree that the so called swat people attacking the station are pretty crap as far as tactics go we were even taught better basic skills than this in raf basic training br br avoid this even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners very bad continuity indeed br br avoid like the plague,0
2809,someone reviewed this movie as a waste of time because he she was expecting the beautiful scenery of brazil and portugal but then everything looked washed out or gloomy or something to that effect i believe this person missed the entire part of the film this is reality the point of this movie is to show that life is not indeed ideal and to show what people go through in their lives for family love and survival a young man leaves his slum in sao paolo brazil to go to portugal to visit his mother's home country after her death he discovers that not everything is free and that brazilians are looked down upon by native people from portugal he eventually finds a life a love but the story does not end as expected and this is not a fairy tale story the part that got me most was the ending song honey baby by gal costa it fit so well with the movie especially the ending,1
2810,warning possible spoilers br br 'rock star' is one of the solid rock movies i have ever seen the original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period he is not only playing their music to the note but also living the life of his idols when his friends in the tribute band expel him in search of some originality the destiny plays him a good turn and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band a dream came true well almost while starting to live the life of the famous including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band br br i liked the film one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack the overall idea is original and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner acting is quite good with mark wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately and jennifer aniston in tune with the nice girl who knows a lot about life role more problematic is the ending which is quite conventional and may disappoint it looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path however in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie br br 8 10 on my personal scale worth seeing however expect exposure to a high dose of metal if you do not like this kind of music you may chose to avoid this film,1
2811,after loomis gives a quick recap of micheal myers we flashback to 1989 where jamie is kidnapped by the man in black before the burning police station explodes micheal returns to once again to find jamie and his baby in this version the loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro active than he is in the final cut the score is much better more in line with parts 4 and 5 none of the electric guitar bs and the ending makes a tad more sense for these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense and cuts back on the gore factor halloween unlike say the friday the 13th was never about blatant gore is why i prefer this bootleg producer's cut not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible the whole cult plot is still very stupid as is micheal fathering a kid br br my producer's cut grade c br br my theatrical cut grade d,0
2812,this metro film is episodic but nearly a constant series of chases mainly trying to escape police whether real or imagined as buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal it is consistently inventive and entertaining its greatest value is in its documenting what hollywood looked like in the early twenties since 95 of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time one gem moment and one gem sequence are present here br br the great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it with buster glumly sitting on the and thus moving from a long shot to a close up within seconds br br the great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor one of the great keaton gags br br kino's print is sharp and clear almost pristine there is a violin piano score accompaniment this is one to seek out and enjoy,1
2813,edge of the city is another movie that owes a lot of credit to on the waterfront from it's nyc locations to its score to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in you can somehow right your wrongs br br edge also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism in my opinion that is where the movie does not succeed like waterfront at 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable br br possible spoilers br br the relationship between sidney poitier and john cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning i don't believe that these two characters from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly br br i think that the whole love sub plot with cassavettes could have been eliminated he is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch the only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end there are other ways that they could have shown this i would have also liked to see some scenes of axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is br br the acting is excellent poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written his role as tyler is interesting and multi layered and especially for 1957 a man who is confident respected and intelligent cassavettes as axel north while very good does not seem quite right for the part warden is terrific as the boss who knows secret although his fight scene with cassavettes at the end is staged horribly too many break away boxes i thought ruby dee was wonderful in role of poitier's wife br br on the whole edge of the city is a smart movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture without taking the time to let the drama build br br 7 out of 10,1
2814,i had borrowed the three sarah movies from a friend and had watched them while sick in bed during one weekend i thoroughly enjoyed every one of them i enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what caleb and his sister were like when they grew up in addition i liked the carry through of the billy boy song that first was heard during the credits of the first movie the title sarah plain and tall however the one thing in winter's end that i didn't like was the youngest daughter she was a very cute little girl but she just had too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids even compared to talkative but still good natured caleb when he was younger,1
2815,83 minutes nope this thing is 72 minutes tops br br if you cannot guess the killer in this movie you had better throw your tv out the window because you ain't learned nothing in 20 years of cinematic slasher history br br and how come the plain star who never gets naked is always the one you want to get naked,0
2816,this is wes craven at his worst this is the very worst horror if you can call it horror you will ever watch esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven poor direction poor acting poor set poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever the bad guy is totally unconvincing you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy the gore and horror involved in the film is laughable it's just plain rubbish the only good points i can think of is it stars natasha gregson wagner giovanni ribisi and lance henriksen but not even that cast could stop this from spiralling out of control and into one of the worst horrors ever if you still ain't watch it yet don't bother you'll only hate it,0
2817,when i saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had mostly filled with robots br br i can relate to problems and i have a similarity to shiro and this is a great film to watch if you're a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me all in all watch it before it's out of print,1
2818,i was able to see anywhere but here last night as a free sneak preview i absolutely loved the film i was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother daughter relationship there was definitely a connection between adele a and ann i think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both susan sarandon and natalie portman sarandon was just the right actress to portray adele and after leaving the theater i could not think of another actress in the role portman was also excellent as ann she brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that i don't think any other teenage actress could i think it would the academy of motion picture arts and sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both sarandon and portman for awards in the actress and supporting actress categories it would be a shame if they were overlooked,1
2819,george saunders is a who steals a rare copy of hamlet killing a guard in the process months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money one of the forgeries is sold to a man working for the nazi's not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up a meeting at the new york public library between various parties however as people begin to die the library is locked down and more murders and perhaps some rare book larceny seem to be close to happening complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a great cast saunders is joined by richard and a cast of solid supporting players if there is a flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves the layers of theft forgery murder and war time intrigue this was 1942 are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time still its an enjoyable little film with a darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs until shows up we're down among some charming thieves whom we like perhaps even more than the hero but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have a completely happy ending and they know it even if they fight it a good little film that's worth searching out,1
2820,i was hoping this would be a good weekly vehicle for tim curry one of my all time favorite performers alas and it is not there doesn't seem to be any chemistry between anyone on the show the dialogue is decidedly uninspired and even the laugh track appeared to be brutal,0
2821,robin williams shows his stand up talents and boosts up his status as a comedian in this movie of what's wrong in american politics and how can hollywood try to make an influence without boring people of course hollywood uses movies with hidden or not so hidden agendas i think this movie is for people who likes stand up and political discussion and the trailers of this movie were for everybody just to make sure as many people as possible will see this everybody knows hollywood is more liberal democrat than the bush co so they have to make these movies every now and then but this one was perhaps too obvious at least i thought so for making any real change br br still great stand up and fresh political issues and talks i enjoyed it and thanks to imdb com ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater and yes i laughed many times sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness see this movie if you like good and clever stand up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now rent it if that doesn't match you,1
2822,br br excellent i have to think back a very long time to find a film that's made me laugh quite so much the writing is top notch the story is satisfying and the entire cast is excellent chris farley has never been better one of the very best comedies of the 90s,1
2823,someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted you may be right but that is how truly are i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk va actually i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else well after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were they went nuts i thought they were gonna bust through my cage gag me and then steal the mail luckily i had not only the president on my side the navy but the federal government us mail that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted they were allowed unlimited shore leave where we had to be back on ship at a certain time they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two only got a 1 week detention on ship whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial is it any wonder why the retention rate is over 85 as a seal you are god so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake,0
2824,beyond is simply marvelous from the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending you will be amazed at how well put together this film is patricia arquette amazingly portrays laura bowman who we meet as a shut down and quit despondent young doctor unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son throughout the course of the film as she is trapped in burma witnesses the democratic and massacres in the capital city of flees for her life and saves her tour u life she is regaining her will to live this may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not john boorman a master at spiritual and emotional conflict paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture laura's emotional state and physical predicament patricia arquette as usual gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded laura what arquette does amazingly in any role that she plays is give us a window into her character's heart without words every time she is given a close up in the film the audience is given insight into her character she does not need to speak to convey emotions or be over the top some critics were harsh on arquette's performance in the film when it opened on august 25 1995 that she was flat or dull in the role i found her characterization dead on staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place she is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you i am hoping that warner brothers releases this title on dvd very soon with arquette's hugely successful nbc drama medium bringing her to household name status not to mention an emmy win and now 2007 nomination it would be in the studio's best interest to do so hopefully there will be extras with the alternate ending do not by pass by this film it is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing,1
2825,three is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie masquerading as a psychological thriller it's closest relative is the monumentally superior dead calm also featuring billy zane dead calm provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of sam neil and nicole kidman's grieving parents attempting to re define their relationship on an ocean cruise they end up being terrorised by zane's adrift psycho killer it provided sharp increasingly suspense a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded br br three suffers from poorly drawn characterisation the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding hammy performances from the principal players zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion in dead calm he was menacing wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence here he is bombastic petulant slimy and unravelled and where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars and how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year ms brook is very picturesque stunningly pretty but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over inflated by some sort of life raft pump they do however succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her dramatic actress in the purest sense of the term she is not the guy playing the voodoo manuel the third component of this sorry triangle could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood no one would notice in fact judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes excuse pun br br plus sides the scenery is nice and the cinematography above and below the water is credible br br i'm guessing this had a very limited if any theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail dvd the reason for this is it's not very good if you want something decent along these lines get dead calm it was made by people who knew a bit about cinema,0
2826,wow don't watch this thinking it's going to be a relaxing circus evening it will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through circus has never been more colourful more exciting and more breathtaking the whole concept is truely amazing you're taken into the world of du soleil and are left with a thousand thoughts when you leave there's only one thing left to do get the cd and or dvd and live through it again and again and again get addicted it's well worth it must be next to the most beautiful thing on earth and one of du best programmes,1
2827,i believe the reason this movie did not get the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of darwin pro and con i would say the real man is depicted here without sterility he is what he is although the movie is but a snapshot of the man the technique of storytelling expanded his life far beyond the years touched on in the movie this is deep movie a pondering of modern life and the way we think and can provoke a study into the man whose thoughts and other who used him have certainly affected our lives there are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the primary job of the actors to stay out of the way the history carried the day and the actors did their job good work to them i say,1
2828,this 22 minute short short of a precursor to the later much better rock and rule features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere the female mouse jan signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade crap music crap clothing and hair style awful folk tunes this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2 disk collector's edition of rock and rule it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself br br my grade d,0
2829,this movie was thought to be low budget but it turned out to be awesome i just rented it from blockbuster and i loved it the acting was very good hot women and some scary parts it is plain and simply worth the money to pay for,1
2830,maybe i saw a cleaned up version but other than a few flashes of breasts i'm not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to br br all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments although the end leaves you wondering wtf it was dark but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation br br film quality could have been better but the acting was pretty decent br br all in all a decently creepy and yes brutal movie with a disappointing ending,0
2831,this is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of rob from british metal gods and how the band replaced him with ripper owens who used to front a priest tribute band originally titled metal god this movie could have been something great instead someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down from the title change of metal god to the middle of the road 'rock star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly having spent most of my life in a professional metal band i was really looking forward to seeing this i was very let down by several points of the film the soundtrack is very not metal for one and the ending of the movie is lame as well the movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole it fails in the end because 1 a movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack 2 there is nothing metal about marky mark or jennifer aniston if bon jovi warrant def and poison are your idea of 'heavy go see this movie if iron maiden judas priest dio black sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh,0
2832,without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing degenerates from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been maintained throughout the movie would be worth a seven br br one wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous contributor said they changed writers and handed over to someone else,0
2833,after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat scan a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure thus freeing the spirit or phantom if you will of the mummy belphegor due to convenient circumstances lisa who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit soon enough she's stealing the museum's egyptian treasures out from under their nose detective comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief br br this is a serviceable enough if you haven't seen any other incarnations of before if you have i recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery it plays out like a slightly higher budgeted sci fi original film and i don't really mean that as a compliment br br eye candy sophie shows ass side boob br br my grade c br br dvd extras none,0
2834,just before dawn is an underrated horror film from the early eighties i haven't seen it in years but it had a great impact when i watched it quite original for its day the only problem is that it has not been released on video or dvd for years if you like horror i urge you to check this little gem out,1
2835,i do think tom hanks is a good actor i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little i was very disappointed in the movie one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard there is a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene there are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made the north pole scenes with santa and the elves could have been cute and charming there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters it usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film this movie totally grates on my nerves,0
2836,let's face it br br this movie is incredibly cliché as korean romance dramas and movies go first of all there's a pair of long lost siblings one of which falls in love with the other second there's a not so popular girl and two gorgeous popular guys who fall for and fight over her third one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease which eventually takes his life br br still i like this movie br br without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel but because the actors fit the roles perfectly the movie is engrossing i honestly couldn't stop watching kang dong won despite his pretty face gives an awesome heartrending performance not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun plus all the supporting actors br br i'd definitely recommend this movie to everyone,1
2837,ok i'll admit it i'm a huge fan of b movies back when michelle bauer linnea quigley and brinke stevens ruled the roost and back then even the bad movies were still good unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad even a small cameo by brinke stevens reprising her role as linda from slumber party massacre 21 years earlier doesn't help this one out a group of cheerleaders take refuge in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down a psycho stalks them one by one catching them in various states of undress bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad skip this turkey and go rent slumber party massacre 1 2,0
2838,at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot bad jokes bad acting and flat out characters everything just bad br br the movie is about pest vargas a two bit scam hustler who is given the chance at 50 000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed br br i know what your thinking what the hell is this a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film br br as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh out loud besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad br br as for character development it's dry and flat you don't learn much about the main character pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany the hunter's son himmel fares better but not much he's really a coward and is snake obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest br br as for the acting no only were there any memorable but just over the top for example john is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top br br overall bad comedy that you'll find for 2 00 at k mart,0
2839,the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out basically i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens any ufo's anything at all suggested by the title of the movie the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was this could have been used to the movie's advantage but i felt instead that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me finally how big was this cast's wardrobe i became so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under poor comedy br br toe thumbs down,0
2840,there was broadcast news and what a good thing it was this one just plain stands up and sounds its barbaric in a manner that resonates two decades later br br there are moments especially with respect to the cutesy score when this film becomes a bit too eighties or a bit too sleepless in seattle fortunately they're few and far between br br one third social satire one third romantic comedy one third drama with three flawed but endearing people at its core it's smart and moving and almost impossibly funny holly hunter in particular may never have been more fun to watch in a comedic role and yes i'm including raising arizona her other star turn from that era in this assessment br br a legitimate classic,1
2841,this is a really dark movie noir indeed the title character is smallpox brought into new york city unknowingly by evelyn keyes br br she is on one mission when she arrives and on a rougher one after she's spoken to her no longer innocent sister but she herself is not intentionally a killer this doesn't mean she doesn't kill it doesn't mean her presence somewhere among eight million other people doesn't throw the city into turmoil br br keyes is excellent the supporting cast is very good too there are several little known people involved in this the director included don't be put off it is a movie to be reckoned with and how nice to see a columbia picture columbia and republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs yet we hardly ever see them anymore,1
2842,i don't recommend you watching this movie if you are easily offended i'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated it's so disgusting and it doesn't make sense all the internet thing is so cliché and the producer obviously didn't understand all the internet rules when you chat with someone you can track their ip address really see the sarcasm here it was dumb pointless and i didn't even watch the end i could always say this doesn't make sense this neither this movie is pure crap at his best nice comment right,0
2843,batman returns is more gothic and somber than its predecessor and i like it a lot also the scenery is more darker and the entire environment is saddening along with the soul chilling music composed by the so talented danny elfman br br however i didn't like the idea to make the penguin a monster unlike to the comic books where he's human even if he looks like a monster he shows well that he possesses a human dignity and i felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his late parents but still he was a dangerous villain in fact and he needed to be stopped br br michael keaton made a tour de force with his return as the dark knight and this time he's powerful as in the original batman it's not difficult to understand why he's called batman in public sometimes br br also michelle pfeiffer is so sexy and well fitted in her role and she gave a faithfully performance as the female villain crimefighter dressed as a cat really the actors did all a masterful work with batman returns which made it a successful movie br br if you liked batman watch its awesome sequel cause it's very worthy for all the dark knight's hard core lovers br br steve,1
2844,all right guys here's the deal with this movie it's not the best but for all of you 80s kids out there it'll bring back fond memories of your childhood personally i love this movie i still love rainbow and the care bears so in my opinion if you aren't a kid now or were a kid that loved and or loves rainbow you won't like this movie at all,1
2845,a giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing havoc boats planes and trains meet their match with the flying creature before unleashing its full wrath on nyc the mantis meets its doom at the hands of the armed forces in a new york tunnel the special effects are of course crude by todays standards but for a ten year old boy in 1957 this was very memorable br br starring are william hopper craig stevens alix and pat conway,0
2846,if you've been laughing too much for a long time and need to take a break br br after reading about 25 reviews of this show i decided to turn it on and check it out for myself everything that each of those people have said about this show is absolutely true mind of mencia is like a half hour version of mad tv but with somehow worse jokes br br one skit i had the displeasure of watching was the second annual stereotype olympics what's funny about black guy who has trouble swimming or gay guy named sparkles that wins a banana eating contest neither of these concepts is particularly novel insightful or amusing do we really need a joke about star wars every episode that movie came out like 30 years ago mencia's solution to funny things up is toss in some stereotypes about hispanics and throw a few in there and call it a day to go home to roll around in his pile of money pure comedic genius br br then he blatantly ripped off jeff foxworthy on a second show i watched with a your gay if bit you could just imagine the roaring laughter he got when he snook in a ryan is gay joke it's not like either of those has already been done to death br br unless you're a big fan of jason friedberg and adam seltzer movies please stay away from this show especially when there are authentic comedians like dave out there who can joke about races and racism and still be insightful,0
2847,i saw this film at the new festival in new york it was by far the worst film there it's use of full frontal nudity and a wishy washy script and direction that neither commits to a re make of nor decides it's a neil labute flick left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this ' it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't i wish the director and editor had re edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience,0
2848,given the subject matter of drug addiction down to the bone almost can't help but be a rather depressing film but depressing doesn't necessarily have to mean bad unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad the film has some good things going for it most notably the quality performance of vera farmiga in the central role of irene a working mom struggling with a cocaine addiction but there isn't enough good here to outweigh the bad the film's failings lie mainly with the story which fails to captivate and never really seems to get going irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support her attempt to kick her habit irene grows close to another recovering addict a male nurse from her rehab center complications ensue but the story never really sparks to life it doesn't seem as if the movie is really going anywhere you can say it's a stark realistic look at the day to day struggles of an addict maybe so but in this case it doesn't make for an interesting movie the whole thing has a very blah feel to it the minimalist cinematography doesn't help matters adding another layer of drab to the incredibly drab proceedings and none of the other performances measure up to hugh dillon is ok as male nurse friend but nobody else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings all in all this movie is a bleak depressing and rather dull ride,0
2849,this movie is very modern and forward it is about 75 in english it is aimed at english speaking multiplex going young audience basic plot is similar to ddlj acting is below average br br unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters is shown drinking from a bottle or taking shots of tequila about 5 6 times in the movie the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work at a beach or at a wedding the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable br br the less that is said about failure of chopra doing shahrukh khan's ddlj role of arrogant girl chaser the better the movie is about equality of sexes but equality should not be about making the same mistakes instead about doing the right to do the right thing if men have been shown as chronic casanovas in movies does not mean women should also portray same behaviour br br even though the movie is made in light hearted fun spirit it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward that fun part of the movie makes no impact not even in canada women dress like this or guys behave like they have shown in the movie it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film the only good thing about this movie is the length 1 5 hrs thank god,0
2850,on humphrey bogart's first trip to hollywood he got his first leading man role in this b picture love affair the first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic love affair later in the decade with charles boyer and irene dunne or the two remakes that followed it's not half as good any of those films br br in fact bogey is second billed to dorothy as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser hale hamilton it comes as quite a shock to she considers a show business career as a way for an income br br bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors is willing to do it besides she likes what she sees in bogey br br considering the cynical roles that bogart later made a specialty it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in love affair the part doesn't wear well on him br br love affair is your average b program second feature nothing terribly special about it,0
2851,don't even try to figure out the logic of this story but do ride along with 10 year old gus on the most bizarre road trip ever witnessed more weird characters and implausible situations than a twin peaks reunion nothing makes sense yet it's impossible to stop watching now where can i find that 'r',1
2852,a very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action but on situation which is all to rare these days i would compare this film to the day of the another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal the acting across the board is superlative aidan quinn has a tricky double role as the vicious terrorist carlos and as the navy man who impersonates him donald sutherland plays the amoral cia agent who hires him ben kingsley plays the israeli officer who assists in the plan this is a very tense and effective film and it's remarkable considering just how little action there is in it the first half of the film is all set up as the navy man prepares to impersonate carlos the second half is a breathless actioner the action coming out of the characters and their situations thus making it all the more gripping a really tight film that shouldn't be overlooked,1
2853,some films are so badly made they are watchable purely for the cringe factor disciples made me cringe so much it was uncomfortable i watched it all disbelieving what i was watching wasn't anyone aware how bad this was whilst they were filming mix the most hammed performances from the most wooden actors an abysmal script were every comment from all of the 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most hurried editing that tried and failed bigtime to give the film a forced pace all these combined into a film that will rob you of a few hours of your life and give nothing in return avoid at every cost,0
2854,this is the best comedy period it is so underrated clever witty humor great casting jerry stiller is the jewel in the show he is so incredibly funny and quirky simply a comical genius doug and carrie have great chemistry i so do not see what the hype is about when it comes to everybody loves raymond it is so overrated with lame jokes mostly forced humor and just not the witty show i can't remember laughing in more than 1 episode king of queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs which is normally caused by arthur spooner i think its about time this comedy gets the hype it deserves and not the lame raymond co,1
2855,here he is a new horror icon for the new millennium better than freddy more dangerous than jason vorhees more evil than michael myers hard to believe i know but his time is here br br ray the prick br br yep the antagonist ray is a complete prick this is partly because of the naughty things he does also because he has a scar oh scary on his face but mainly because ray the prick has been milked br br yep ray doesn't channel evil he doesn't even become cursed not even by a voodoo spell nope ray the prick has been milked as deniro once said you can milk anything with nipples and ray has been milked of evil br br how do you milk evil you ask snake nipples i reply snake nipples br br why ray you ask because he's a prick i reply capital p br br watch out for the new line pictures extravaganza entitled freddy vs ray the prick br br thought your new horror saviour was the creeper well not any more cause ray the prick is here and i'm frightened br br pity about the atmosphere less pg 13 unoriginal workmanlike quality of the film though because ray's a star,0
2856,i absolutely loved every minute of this film jack black and kyle gass most definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship hard rocking and destiny br br filled to the brim with unnecessary swearing in every sentence toilet humour and the general rule breaking attitude this movie is a must see for the hard core tenacious d fans of the world br br we follow the journey of young jack black and kage kyle gass as they try and recover the pick of destiny to win the open mic night and to become the greatest band on the planet the duo have to overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task i'll let you see whether they make it or not br br the soundtrack itself is awesome enough and now we see the d in person making the experience even more magical a must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious d fan watch out for the inside jokes from the first album,1
2857,i am so glad when i watch in every time the movie of ray for the sidney of the 21st century jamie foxx who played this role as an evidence of his brilliant ability as an actor to take his position beside great actors in hollywood by his golden supporting for the strong abilities of afro american actors all over the times and periods by his eternal work as an evidence for the eternity of ray charles as a grand prove for their legend appearance in every time by their success for winning oscar prize as best actor for leading role an best mixing sound between fact and cinematic scenes upon ray and jamie as a mixing between two copies of ray ray of the past and ray of 2004 acted in the person of jamie foxx it was nice from the director to choose those songs to be adapted with dramatical scenes in the accidents of film to enter for the atmosphere of success in legend corn with legend movies in hollywood since 1893 till now and his cleverness of choosing sharon in the role of ray s mother that she succeeded in this role by brilliant analysis for the core of her character that ray s mother was the turning point for him upon her grew up to be independent on himself to take his place in this world and to be icon in his talent as nat king cole louis armstrong duke ellington and at the end of this film by receiving his honorable report from and their decision to take his song georgia on my mind the national anthem for this state he made his promise for his mother to be alive until now by his legend songs and brilliant life,1
2858,jeff powers lou diamond phillips young guns 1 2 a cop with a history of roughing up criminals is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division this doesn't sit well with jeff's newspaper reporter girlfriend kelly chelsea field who's looking for a story on the squad soon enough jeff's conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn scott glenn the hunt for red october the leader of the unit br br this is a fairly routine dare i say mundane cop action drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l lester directed films right before this one from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo were all highly entertaining vehicles br br eye candy chelsea field gets briefly topless br br my grade d,0
2859,i give this a 10 out of 10 not because the plot was hard to uncover because it wasn't but because it leaves one caring for the characters the acting by all the cast is superb especially joan and it's a marvellous episode because of it's heart br br miss marple is called upon by jason dying request to investigate and solve a murder that happened some seven or eight years previously and she has to discover who why and when as she goes along mr is the same as was in a caribbean mystery and so there is a sense of a connection here br br nemesis is definitely one for the amateur psychologists among us and if you are one of those who is only happy with lots of blood guts and rip roaring action sequences then you won't like it but if you are like me one who loves knowing about people and discovering what makes them tick then nemesis is the one for you,1
2860,wow this really is stereotypical terrible trash i feel sorry for anyone who may have wasted their money to see this br br i am pretty sure i did not laugh once during this whole movie i just cannot believe they would make such a terrible movie br br i will now be more wary when i watch late night movies br br this is most definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i am not saying it is the worst movie in existence though it could be but i don't think i have seen anything so stupid and unfunny it my life it makes the scary movie series look intelligent br br 1 10 i'd give it a 0 if they would let me,0
2861,the always delightful kevin spacey makes us once again question certain truths in our lives after driving us into believing he is a mumbling small time crook only to expose the true power of cinematic deception in the classic the usual suspect this time around he leads us into believing he is a likable alien who assumes a human form whilst strolling around the earth br br is a peculiar stranger who has seemingly appeared out of nowhere only to be hospitalized in the manhattan psychiatric institution dr mark powell jeff bridges soon takes extreme interest in him and even finds himself pondering if is actually a supreme being from planet k pax or perhaps he is only a forgotten human being with severe psychiatric issues while the ending can be seen and discussed in many ways it remains a complex enlightening journey which leaves a gr eat deal of intriguing philosophical questions behind it,1
2862,cowboys and indians is an excellent film the writing acting directing could not have been better this was a story that begged to be told and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so stories like this one are not pleasant ones but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world it is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed a film that can do that is a rare a special thing andrew is an excellent writer and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film br br thank you for telling this story br br ruby,1
2863,last year i fell in love with the tim burton's version of sweeney todd so i wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and i found this one at the library though i think burton's is best probably because i like film a lot better than theater this is still a great production of the story i haven't seen any of the other versions but i am trying to get my hands on them br br after seeing johnny depp as todd it's hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but george does a fantastic job angela lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic i found myself singing along this is a play you won't want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you won't have a biased view like me,1
2864,so real and surreal all in one i remember feeling like tessa heck i remember being tessa this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending i especially liked the protesters tangent it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it if you get the chance to see this take it it is well worth the 30 minutes,1
2865,if one overlooks the technical problems of this early 1930 sound movie such as the sound quality and the occasional stiffness of john wayne one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since beginning at the missouri a large caravan of wagons people and animals head west the wagons are pulled down huge cliffs and cross a flooded river with considerable risk to the riders in the wagons indians meet with wayne and allow the train to pass through their land later indians gather west of the train to combat them the wagons form a huge circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their rifles creating with the circling indians a veil of smoke br br when the battle ends the dead are buried on the spot and the people and wagons depart this scene is remarkable as the camera stays with the dead as the living depart it is unique in the way it links the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from the living the wagons encounter a major thunderstorm with torrential and mud everywhere they finally arrive at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest in oregon the film is done in 70 mm widescreen at about a 2 0 1 ratio in 1930 br br i haven't mentioned the plot because it is secondary to the scenic grandeur and the enormous amount of work involved in making this film moviemakers will never work this hard again to make such a movie or any movie given the technical limitations of the sound the music is at times moving such as when wayne leaves his girl to hunt down his friend's killers and at the end br br while all the critics rave about the searchers and wayne's psychology racism short temper and complex characters the big trail gives us a story of simple people encountering extraordinary hardships one of the best westerns i have seen,1
2866,go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons and you got yourself a film well that's what these guys thought anyway it was so bad i can't even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in 'nam despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the cliché writing i think this movie isn't the worst i've ever seen i'm saving that slot for everything with steven seagal chuck norris and jean claude van dam anyhow if you are out of options when it comes to finding new horror films that you haven't seen 1 000 times already as i was and you are debating this one i would still skip this it had absolutely no redeeming qualities this mock serial killer thriller was a weak puny attempt at an even b film if they're really lucky it might make the wal mart 4 50 bin but i highly doubt it,0
2867,now i like victor herbert and i like mary martin and allan jones but it would have been nice to see a real biography of victor herbert walter connolly as herbert does have a decent resemblance to him in his latter years br br jones and martin sing beautifully though the herbert music is just there to adorn the plot line concerning these two musical performers jones's john ramsay is a frail character very similar to gaylord in showboat who jones also played br br as for mary martin it's a mystery why she never had a good hollywood career she did films with bing crosby and dick powell as well as this one she performed well but movie audiences didn't take to her the best musical moment in the film is jones and martin in a duet of thine alone the recordings i have of the song are individual and it was written as a duet there's also a pleasant scene with jones and martin riding bicycles swapping herbert songs as they ride br br the real victor herbert with his womanizing and his irish patriot background and his musical training in germany where he developed a love for all things german would have been a fascinating study he was also a cello virtuoso before he turned full time to composing i have to take strong exception to the reviewer who said cuddles would have been a good victor herbert as irish hello br br nice movie but the real vic would have been so much better,1
2868,too bad this movie isn't while nemesis game is mildly entertaining i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that sara was putting herself into are we supposed to believe that br br 1 this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles br br 2 the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun but don't put the whole i never sinned riddle together until the very end and then and then get this she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together i know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think we're that stupid br br 3 when vern and sara go to the chez m to question the blonde there is not one topless chick in the whole building nada c'mon i know it's canada but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon tweed br br and anyone else notice that when vern was surfing the web and found that site that when he over the link the cursor stayed an arrow and didn't turn into a little hand like all do when you click on a i mean if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right geez,0
2869,i saw this movie in its brief run in art house cinema in '69 i found it so funny that i literally spent part of the movie on the floor having laughed so hard i fell out of my seat in retrospect years later i thought it had been done by melvin van peebles when i mentioned it to a friend he said that a friend of his downey sr filled virtually every non acting role in the flick director writer producer etc he was right of course and my memory was wrong except that this was one of the movies ever made the part of the arab was particularly priceless,1
2870,this movie was bad on so many levels the writing was horrible so even the best actors could not have made this movie watchable it's a shame because they did have some good actors in this movie i mean if anyone has seen any of the police academy movies you would know that steve guttenberg was good his character in this movie was very serious which was a big difference from characters i have seen him play before so that was a plus and i did think that steve guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie with or without the shirt you can not deny that he has a great body sexy face too loved the 5 o'clock shadow look it made him look dangerous at one part in the movie he is lying in bed without his shirt and i have to say i would have gladly jumped in there and tried to take his mind off of his problems so honestly i would watch this movie again just to fantasize,0
2871,gilmore girls is one of the funniest most clever sharp witted sarcastic and heart warming television shows i've ever watched second only to my most favorite television show of all time f r i e n d s the quick pace and many pop culture references can leave some viewers confused but once you catch on to the ways of the you'll be hooked for life just some random comments i recently finally began watching season 6 and wow it's one of my favorite seasons so far i love the luke thing and all the drama in the various episodes is as always exhilarating the only thing i'm not so fond of is the surprising bad attitude and reckless actions rory has suddenly unfortunately i don't find this very realistic and hope it's not just a way to stir up some more drama to keep the season going strong all in all great season though and i can't wait for the next br br a k a,1

2873,i just wanted to say that i love so i automatically loved this movie everything else about it was so so billy crystal is a good actor even if he is annoying but the thing that made this movie was at least for a basketball fan seeing act,1
2874,this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time if you suffer from insomnia it is a fool proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time as the movie slowly progresses the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action sweet babes br br also mr eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps for no apparent reason an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film honestly i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons br br some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as one of the greatest movies of all time and truly a masterpiece well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries surely what they meant to say was one of the greatest snooze fests of all time and truly an epic fail br br in conclusion don't waste your time if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality go to www youtube com and watch a halo 3 montage if i played the movie battleship potemkin in a game of slayer on guardian i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then its dead body peace,0
2875,when this showed at the seattle int'l film fest i was the only person standing and clapping and cheering the rest of the crowd booed or was silent it is a well played small film that reaches deep into the reality of a young gay man's humanity it is about a real man and does not play to the insipid hyper buffed muscular gay that passes for the genre of non porn gay cinema and that is why so much of contemporary gay genre movies are so dull this movie is intense and great tragedy the acting and directing and cinematography is fantastic it all keeps the film clastrophobic and tense and passionate don't miss this if you can find it,1
2876,i hardly know where to begin br br huge continuity issues bad acting etc for example sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head br br but the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family is not even touched upon instead in the movie he gets ticked off at his family and leaves his wealthy parents to be by himself and when he gets tired of it he goes home where is his development where is the arc br br if you have never read the book and can get through the hokey double triple quadruple visions of the falcon and terrible production quality crackling ahem fire winter winds stopping their howling for the dialog and then restarting etc i guess it might be ok for an 8 year old br br but compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment br br read the book instead,0
2877,i remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre i recently found a copy on vhs it held up to my memory of it while obviously not a big budget film the acting is quite credible the scenery locales costumes are very well done i only wish the mammoths had been in more of the picture but when you see them they are also well done remember sfx was done in those days without benefit of computers some poor devil had to actually put all that hair fake tusks on real elephants the same effect was used on the elephants in quest for fire a better than average adventure film a chance for the star rod cameron to play something besides a cowboy which he also did very well over the years,1
2878,reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy and the plot was a variant on the demon comes to small redneck village type story king likes to tell the characters were all described in loving detail and it made both a good psychological and gory horror the film on the other hand is awful gone are the character interactions and clever plot and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this else avoid at all costs as with most films of king's books,0
2879,the worst movie i've ever seen in my life from the amateur directing to the porn quality acting it looks like a home movie somebody decided to shoot becuase they had nothing else to do with their time br br unless you have no hope left in life absolutely avoid this crap br br,0
2880,the movie forever strong will never be nominated for an oscar it will never be nominated for best acting for best motion picture but this movie does have things that other movies don't in a nation with so much scandal so many problems movies being poured out with little thought to the morals of society at least this movie promotes good what is wrong with standing behind something that promotes happiness we should support movies that tell our american teens that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol as for this debate as previously stated the is not exclusive to the new zealand all blacks various utah high school football teams and colleges perform this ritual before games including hawaii byu etc,1
2881,everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time the acting writing cinematography music visuals everything was top notch as an avid fan of the genre both lesbian films and gymnastics i was so unbelievably pleased by this film it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board hearing the q a with the cast and crew was great the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important and the writer did a hell of a job as well as directing and the editing was awesome thanks so much for making a great film thanks also for the line about 'if you're going to slap a label on yourself it would be i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight it's wonderful to see getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community and it was nice that labels weren't even necessary at all in this film what an ending just when i thought it couldn't give me more it did beautiful work and my applauds to all i will spread the word this is definitely a film not to be missed,1
2882,oz is an old tv series released by hbo it shows the life in one security prison called oswald but the main plot is focused on emerald city which is one of the prison levels br br oz have an amazing plot and an outstanding cast there are many of characters and almost all of them are very interesting basically they are divided in groups gangs the the black people the aryans the gays the latinos and many others who doesn't have any specific group but deal with many others like ryan o'reily the irish br br the plot is very well built there are a lot of conspiracy inside a lot of fight for the power but all of this is not just exposed in form of violence all is very intelligent and smart nothing happens without a reason all is connected and very interesting to guess i really love this series and who wanna see something intelligent very well produced with a very good cast and performances must see oz,1
2883,the a team is still repeating every day on dutch television around and i still watch it i don't like the a team i absolutely adore them it is just great to see justin chasing the former members of a team brings back memories from the old days when i was young an sweet i would have given you a 10 for excellent but justin looks like he is chasing the former a team members all by himself of course that is the only bad thing on this documentary too bad justin does not look for melinda amy a allen but it is great to see mr t back into action too bad for him he does not show up at the party at the end but that party is too short to laugh again and to see everybody in action again,1
2884,with matthias hues on the cover and only 3 00 i had to buy it i enjoyed some moments like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids but i only really watched to see matthias scenes i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end it was a cross between clint eastwood's the good the bad and the ugly and for a few dollars more a 3 man quick draw showdown with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer apart from that there's really nothing more i can add the actors gave good performances all except the assassin droid whose performance was nothing outside of comical but the movie really lacked depth and purpose simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball gets rolling for example the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times taking up two fifths of the movie br br the scenery really lacked depth and creativity probably due to the films budget i don't think we ever did get to see this perfect city of new angeles that was always talked about in fact when the main characters finally reached new angeles its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways hardly the kind of kingdom the owner creator of an entire city would dwell in the super high security of new angeles was also always talked about but only a total of 15 maybe 20 security guards were counted even when the alarm went off not even close to approximation of at least a hundred men out there br br if you are a fan of any of the actors actresses in this film then you may want to watch it simply to add it to the list however if you value 1 and a half hour of your time or 3 00 of your money you may want to give this one a miss,0
2885,all grown up is basically a spin off and not much else of the original rugrats cartoon that featured the babies tommy pickles chucky finster lil and phil deville angelica susie and later kimi sister and tommy's brother i grew up with rugrats and thought it was a great cartoon it had excellent humor nice stories and the show's creators klasky csupo were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies the new show all grown up tries to recapture the magic of the original cartoon i was disappointed when i saw it i found the all grown up chuckie just annoying and the whole pre teen acting mature trying to be popular that applied to unfortunately all of the characters dull and washed out there still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of rugrats look ten years from their age in the original show overall this show is and only watchable if a you're a die hard fan of the rugrats b have never seen the original show c you're a pre teen that has nothing to do or d your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show this show is not that good it doesn't compare to the older rugrats episodes in quality humor and everything else,0
2886,ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves as bad as submerged no but that is not saying much like perfume on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute sighs the rest br br several notable faces turn up to slum it sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check no more rappers please br br at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago,0
2887,there are many many older movies that deserve to be transferred to the dvd format this is surely one of them an anthony quinn triumph scores of movies portray the victims of nazi atrocities before and during the war but i don't think any of them have delved into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this this one has anthony quinn was truly a man for all seasons he had the ability to portray the humblest of creatures devoid of any human to a creature of extreme and pull it off as believable to the audiences who watched with no afterthought of what they had just witnessed truly one of our greatest artists he is missed,1
2888,it ends with the declaration that the film you have just seen was an improvisation at once making you feel like an idiot for thinking an improvisation was an good movie and astounded at cassavetes' genius once again of course cassavetes told some guy it wasn't really an improvisation per se on his deathbed so it's the story about a light skinned black woman lelia who passes for white and her family another passing for white brother named ben and a black black brother named hughie when she falls in love with a white jerk named tony he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out she's black and from there it goes on about the three main characters' individual aspirations and shortcomings hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure still hopelessly depressed over tony and ben is angsty and violent in general in desperate need of something to shock him out of his stale patterns of existence overall i suppose it's really about stasis vs change in human life i suspect that cassavetes had the plot organized enough and it was just the dialogue that was improvised the dialogue itself is very uneven sometimes somebody will say something very memorable other times it's memorably awkward what's amazing is the extent of the amateur actors' embodiment of their characters cassavetes went through the acting class he was teaching at the time he decided to do shadows whispered in the ears of the ten best students and this was the result the guys playing ben and hughie are very good at first i didn't like lelia but as the film progressed you see more and more she's one of those actors who gets better as the tension and drama builds not necessarily the best with small talk shadows is hailed by many as the forerunner of the indie film movement made in 1959 and it's definitely recommended,1
2889,dee snider was inspired to do a two part song by a horror movie this movie he wrote directed produced and starred in details the subjects from those songs horror from stay hungry people have commented he must have a sick mind to put something like this out i don't hear anybody making comments like that about stephen king wes craven dean koontz or in his own time alfred hitchcock the movie profiles a modern psychotic created by current trends in society personally i thought it was pretty well done from sheer imagination and inspiration also without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with actual victims criminals this movie is perfect if you want something to give you nightmares and make you cringe about the possible and probable it could happen,1
2890,this is an incredibly compelling story told with great simplicity and grace the story itself is the object of the film although the scenery is beautiful the acting is understated even superbly so for the characters themselves come through in all of their eccentric simplicity br br this piece of art will likely not be appreciated by those who view movies casually without due attention it takes work to be brought into the story but once you become involved the is complete,1
2891,a ridiculous movie a terrible editing job worst screenplay ridiculous acting a story that is completely br br if god was going to decide if movies should continue to be done judging by this one the entire world movie industry would now be dead br br a wonderful movie to show that cinema should not be done by people who think they can make movies br br i am still wondering who are those two girls who show up in the movie for over half an hour and are never introduced to us br br,0
2892,if you thought rosemary's baby was bad this one isn't much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like it's lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast br br rating 1 2 out of,0
2893,the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments much less hundreds of speaks volumes as to the decline of western or at least american civilization br br read proust you morons or at least dave barry or calvin and anthologies br br chuck norris wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes nay hours viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service br br please don't watch this show spare your few remaining brain cells,0
2894,no no is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless cgi movies being made the pastel and color pencil backgrounds were a surprise after sen to chihiro no spirited away and no shiro howl's moving castle being so similar stylistically the style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well the time and effort put in to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better there are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action the greatest to me being a scene were sisters transform into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them the story is simple but fairly well written and played out the plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it wasn't played out as well as in no totoro my neighbor totoro it is still great i felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike spirited away which was so jammed with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series the radish spirit there was a another whole movie right there my only real problem with the movie was the end the way its worded in the english version at least makes it seem like there's going to be some great test given to which turns out to be just him promising mother that he will love though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it the movie did seem to end abruptly though other than that the movie was great and i highly recommend it,1
2895,my sister a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the 24th of september we had all seen the first jackass movie a while back and we all enjoyed it we were really looking forward to number two br br we were not disappointed br br from start to finish i was laughing hysterically it is equal parts shocking and amusing however and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches it is obscene but it is also groundbreaking american cinema well perhaps that's a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their stuck to ice sculptures but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not things that no other decent american movie released nation wide would dare show us br br there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene and it involved a horse i'll not elaborate br br i laughed i nearly gagged and i came damn close to crying out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball not sadness in my humble opinion jackass number two is the film of '06 br br does that make me a jackass perhaps but if it does i could really care less,1
2896,in my opinion this is the best oliver stone flick probably more because of influence than anything else riviting stuff full of dread from the first moment to its dark ending,1
2897,omg it is seriously the best show in the world it rocks harder then jackass and and is so funny and entertaining i love the show all 5 seasons are awesome but for a quick summary season 1 great if you wanna plan a scavenger hunt watch the house be pulled apart and enjoy seeing phil bing starved br br season 2 great if you wanna see them buy castle bam watch a slayer concert see the wonder that is mardi gras and the fun of getting to it see a demo derby and actually see a the making and opening of a tree top casino br br season 3 great if you wanna see probably the first driveway a civil war johnny knoxville a pirate ship and don vito actually winning one of reindeer games br br season 4 great if you wanna see them in europe them getting jobs the building of a state and a bayou and the season 5 great if ya want to see them in brazil birthday mike the metal bams disappearing bams hummer being destroyed a playboy party in bams swimming pool and the very last ever viva la bam,1
2898,now i am not prone to much emotion but i cried seeing this movie it certainly has more appeal among blacks than other ethnic groups but there is something here for everyone the classic song it's so hard to say goodbye really makes this one worth watching at least once,1
2899,this is another good western which i enjoyed it's not an epic or anything but it is good for what it is it' about 3 fur led by a men named jed who is crude and uncivilized jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and indian band who resent the americans on their land and want to take it back that's the gist of the story what follows is action excitement even a bit of humour and forbidden romance one of jed's friends gus reminded me a lot of the character quint played by robert shaw in the movie jaws they both have that crusty gruff demeanor anyway if you're a western fan you should find lots to like about this particular entry i think it deserves a 7 10,1
2900,great party movie following the adventures of bill tom two high school buddies at opposite ends of the spectrum bill eric stolz prefers to live life straight laced while his friend tom chris penn takes nothing seriously except partying all the time when bill moves out of his mother's house to live on his own he faces many issues from his girlfriend to his brother to his landlord meanwhile his friend tom moves in to keep the rent down but proceeds to turn bill's life upside down this movie is non stop comedy from start to finish and is a personal favorite of mine soundtrack features guitar edward van halen throughout the movie also features cameos by rockers lee ving and ron wood 70s legend kitten navidad also makes an appearance classic 80s movie is worth multiple looks now all that needs to be done is a much anticipated dvd release if you enjoyed this movie take a look at the last american virgin which is similar to wild life i rate both highly,1
2901,simply awful i'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a jokes from the movie there is nothing else to spoil as it is already rotten this dross was made during what must have been one of sellers' for a few dollars more periods when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks i'd seen this as a 15 year old high school student in 1972 and loathed it then no need to view it again after 35 years i remember it now as one of the top five worst movies i'd seen as a kid as i recall sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here but even his presence couldn't the stale jokes lame plot and infantile repartee one ongoing theme revolves around sellers' use of his fingers in one scene he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos and by folding down his fingers enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists the interns the nurses the administrators etc until only his middle finger is left up whereupon he says and the patients har har in another scene to avoid costly lab tests he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar then the interns gathered around him to do the same which they do he then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine but sucked on the index finger and admonishes them to pay attention hee hee the only reason that i remember this and this movie and am writing this review is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today if yu you gonna luv dis if not see with george c scott came out the same year 1972 for some genuine marvelous black medical humor better yet read 'the house of god' by samuel and if you can see the movie version of it which has never been released please make a copy and send it to me i'd love to finally see it,0
2902,i thought that the storyline came into place very well i liked this movie a lot if you're going to rag on a bridget fonda movie you can just rot i thought that ragging on movie stars was a bad idea apparently somebody doesn't think so i rather enjoyed the movie i'm even thinking of buying it i want it to be my very first dvd for my room that's how much i like it i rather would not start an online argument with someone i don't know have it be over a movie if someone could kindly retract what they said about the storyline i would be more than happy to retract my insult however if they feel that i am not worthy of a i might just feel that they are not worthy of one either but i can't control their actions i can only encourage them in the right direction hey they don't have to make a but i would greatly appreciate it,1
2903,this is one of my all time favourite movies if ur not into cars then forget it this movie features 1 of aussies greatest muscle cars the yeah so the acting not the greatest it was never made to win an oscar the car action will keep you back for more and more there is a cool collection of muscle cars from the 70's and an awesome with a real cool cat it also there is a really cool song sung by terry serio the main actor the acting is pretty funny when taken lightly but the tyre smokin and drag racing is the main focus in this movie big fast cars with of steel no plastic cars and some cool street dragging i recommend it only to people that are into cars and not someone looking for great acting,1
2904,this is certainly a good film beautifully photographed and evocatively acted yet one should certainly criticize it and for it is not without flaws and weaknesses really cared for women and wanted to make statements on man's lack of sympathy and total cruelty yet he sometimes gets ahead of himself in trying to make this statement by adopting the wrong means this is certainly a case in 'the crucified lovers' 'princess yang and he sets the scenario in feudal japan which leaves the viewer at the end with the partially right exclamation boy does suck i'm glad that it is over and true some of the scenarios such weaker films of present would be literary impossible today also his women characters sometimes become archetypes of unrealistic self sacrifice which also simplifies the scenario less appealing saying that crucified lovers is a good film with such few relative weaknesses though the sometimes chilly cynical prose by the screenwriter helps this film allot i still highly prefer and recommend films of 1936 and of the as well as his late masterpieces in which he showed more restraint and subtlety and 'the life of,1
2905,he's the only reason to see this film he gives a very good performance much better than this crap deserves he's very handsome and very talented he deserves better than this also depressing is to see malcolm mcdowell in this he's another talented actor who deserves better but like esai he gives a very good performance so if you're fans of either of them you might want to watch otherwise stay away one more complaint couldn't we have had more scenes of esai shirtless,0
2906,you would probably get something like this i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence of course there are stupid hollywood movies about drunken teenagers on a spring break but those movies don't even claim to be serious works of art but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things br br one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much i wish someone told the director that it's kind of ridiculous even in an unrealistic art movie to portray a slavic woman as a half articulate dishevelled creature connected to the forces of nature probably due to the fact that she had spent her entire childhood looking at the stars and milking cows on a three legged stool,0
2907,michael comic book stories particularly his work on madman usually are a great deal of fun no budget indy film is the opposite of fun br br worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience pretty certain understands going on but he's the only one daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target br br is some kind of movie tie in to red rocket 7 comic book which ironically is mostly unreadable so if your experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over sized comics and continue the fun br br felt sorry for who was totally out of his depth attempting a film also felt sorry for myself what an incredible waste of my time and money please buy my vhs copy which is available right now on ebay hurry up,0
2908,this film came as a gift a late night offering out of the blue so unlike other reviewers i had no preconceptions whatsoever i found myself glued to my seat as the film slowly dictated its own rhythm its own unfolding i was drawn to acknowledge my own deep love and humanity as i willed for good to prevail but also forced to wryly acknowledge that sometimes i was on the side of the bad guys the film is quite quite beautiful the word elegiac comes to mind and this more than because the film begins and ends in an far from being depressing or confronting to me the film acknowledges deep suffering and then by its nature with the births and re births as well as the deaths the film celebrates the fact that to quote an aussie poet there is sometimes gladness oh gods i feel as tho i've just written a love letter to this film but there it is,1
2909,i've rent the movie because i'm very fond on war movies and on the cover picture i've read better than save private ryan mmmmm i thought cool guys is just a ridiculous movie almost fun nothing to do with a proper war movie i want my money back why the f k the peoples lies f no subtitles they tried to make everything cooler with the light but they didn't make it sorry about this but the movie is awful the italians are shown as mafia e br br the american as stupid farmer the germans as even more stupid farmer br br the actor are ridiculous and unprofessional br br please please,0
2910,when i first heard about this movie i eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those so bad it's fun movies and that i was in for a treat i was wrong br br for starters the pace is agonizingly mind numbingly slow the pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15 20 minutes of the movie the plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere this movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwise br br try child's play instead,0
2911,it is important and only fair to remember that at the time this short was produced a state of war existed between the united states and the empire of japan add to that the enormous ill will that the beginning of the war created as well as the bataan death march and other incidents and the only thing surprising about this short and others is that there weren't more of them one other thing my only problem with this short is that it seems to try to be funny but it isn't i'm not sure that anyone connected with it really tried to make the jokes work or even cared it would have been far better if they had done what disney did with education for death and been totally serious but this short gets a bad rap and shouldn't be judged out of context the times were different then and that is an important consideration anyone expending energy trying to save the world from a sixty year old cartoon needs to take a step back as do i expending energy defending that same cartoon this should be available to interested parties even if not in wide circulation not a nice cartoon but sometimes life isn't nice recommended,1
2912,eh it's not really as good as the other the villains are actually rip offs of other z villains like cell and even majin with baby being clone super 17 being clone and the shadow dragons being clone s the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking shrinking it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going let us not forget how weak the characters become can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than pan it's sad i know speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that cuteness and become an irritating whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and trunks well i don't know what to say about trunks gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise if you really like dragonball then avoid this series it doesn't even feel like dragonball i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad at least to me and the theme songs both ending and opening are better japanese not american might've been better if san worked on it,0
2913,the distribution was good the subject could have been interessant and comic whereas he described the wandering of an old non credible communist looking for loving sensations instead of this the atmosphere is nor lively nor heavy,0
2914,if you have seen this movie then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies who would of known that they will copy terminator 2 the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands average thats the problem with this film if you want to make a t2 style movie then do it properly the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl in the previous birth dead by 2 guys but the blame goes to 10 people she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death not to mention the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers he can transform into anything he can fly disappear fire power wind power you name it he has it he even gets and survives the style you are probably wondering how he survives its best not to ask and its best not to waste time and money on this movie its best just to forget this film even came out i think its a shame to use a big for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline,0
2915,full of surprises beautiful cruel at times just like life itself leaves one asking for more the best parts are of course the action scenes and chases have to really wonder how much work these guys put into making some scenes whale chases polar bear hunts etc it is a wonderful experience and not to be missed by anyone who dives surfs or goes to the beach once in a while the music is enticing and the narration is superb and extremely well paced definitively one of the best documentaries ever made and worth not less than a very respectable 10 for its kind some of the footage is very cruel and might not be recommended for people with weak stomachs every killer whale footage is cruel,1
2916,this is a rip off of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer the story is classic some high school students tries a prank on the asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong terribly wrong when you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time not good if a movie tries to be scary the actors are quite ok and the girls are cute after all they're asian so i'll give it two out of five on the,0
2917,this is absolutely nothing like the wwf and the era' of the wwf i have always been a dedicated wwf fan and i never took a glimpse of its competition now i rue the day that i wanted the wwf to take charge at the least the wcw would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the actual intentions of the show and this holds true to ecw as well the wwf has always been about hulk hogan andre the giant and other old wrestlers like so and the era' only happened to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition the wwe is the same trash as it was before the attitude era only dumbed down and the wrestlers are terrible the brand split is mind scrambling and the story lines and are non existent the wwe is so bad that it ceases to even be a former shell of itself by pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event suddenly and by retaining barriers of creativity sure the show shakes the brains of sweet innocent and easily brain washed children and meager lousy pariah stupid people of the internet wrestling community that actually consider the company anything good anybody that even shudders and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell,0
2918,it's partly bad luck for that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk but a whole lot more ponderously br br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets by a writer's life but there's a whole lot of orson welles ish ego in this produced by directed by lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine with an adorable cameo by their son br br each actor gets his her moment literally in the spotlight but there's so many or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a diva christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film br br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written 8 21 99,0
2919,the fact that after 50 years it is still a highly watchable movie says a lot about it it is more intelligent and interesting than almost all recent movies of the same genre you can find and has a certain endearing feeling of innocence to it i am not a big fan of this type of movies but i could watch the whole thing without being bored which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who does not necessarily share your taste in films i liked the black and white palette the excellent casting the clever heist scene that keeps you guessing about what trick they will pull next and the ending like everyone else watching the heist sequence makes one realize the power of silence which is unfortunately so underused in today's cinema,1
2920,this film is exceptional in that marlene raymond present outstanding performances the acting in this film is the greatest strength of the production but the script direction and editing deserve applause there is an extraordinary chemistry that exsists between the two stars if you like marlene and you like raymond you'll love this film it's a classic that compares with casablanca br br,1
2921,the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy the first one unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland it's as if director blew half his budget in the first five minutes just getting the set up the way he wanted it watch the beginning and think about the city story,0
2922,first of all i want to say ang lee did a very good job on this one i watched it yesterday and i was presently surprised the story is very good but all the ignorant people would say this sucks people cant fly to them i say it's fiction and that it is this is not to be taken as a film about reality you could say this is a fairytale and a very pleasant to watch asian fairytale the can actually blow your mind because there so artistically filmed ang lee has a very u might say big talent the fight scene's are very cool and beautifully brought to the viewer but it's sad but this film didn't get the appreciation it should have gotten but ang lee did fortunately get the attention he deserved with his blockbuster broke back mountain so even for viewers who are not interested in the story the images are entertaining enough,1
2923,the production values for this film make it fall short of hollywood blockbuster status and the script makes it fall short of cult status what is left is a tired formulaic attempt at the disaster movie genre that will disappear with the ebb tide br br a decent cast are either miss cast or cannot be bothered the beautiful joanne whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of police commissioner nash who wears the most irritating matching waist clincher above her skirt br br plays the heavyweight part of director of the thames barrier with all the conviction of a fairground candy floss her canadian nationality and accent were presumably drafted in to appeal to a transatlantic audience it and she fails her initial appearance in a tight fitting pink jogging suit as she arrives at work is risible br br the part of the siren old git who was right is played by tom as though he is acting in his sleep and the various plot twists that are designed to his son played by robert carlyle struggle to get any response from him br br nigel looks determined to commit ritual hari kari for his failings as met office director or for his acting or both and only david suchet emerges with some credit for his role as deputy pm br br there was enough in the story and the cast and the effects to have produced a decent effort alas that did not happen,0
2924,quirky vulnerable raw honest and a treat to watch i'm not here to give a summary or synopsis of the film i simply wish to congratulate this small film with the great big heart i tip my hat to the filmmaker and it's excellent cast if you want to know what happens in the film then go see it michael writer director has handled a very sensitive and emotional subject matter suicide with great compassion comedy and empathy i see a great career ahead for mr this film works right from the outrageous opening sequence to the tender honest moments between david and natasha as with every movie we need to suspend some disbelief yet i found with max and grace i was easily transported and completely convinced with it's surreal moments i only wish they would have pushed some of those moments even further mr has pulled some wonderful performances from this already talented cast for instance guillermo performance as a patient in the asylum was hysterical as well as moving the colossus ralf former mr olympiad as a terrified patient perfect i can go on and on this independent feature has the star power of a big budget hollywood film however you forget about the stars on screen as you flow along with this wonderfully written story the real star here is the brilliant screenplay i look forward to seeing more from writer director michael,1
2925,this episode had potential the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly rings is somewhat interesting and when she explores the noise there is genuine tension and fear but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had br br first of all the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction e g it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago the door opened by itself without me touching it etc given these supernatural phenomena plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room wouldn't she take some before entering it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the lights also while in the haunted apartment she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesn't need to be involved walk up to the phone and unplug it case closed br br finally showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony brave little toaster anyone,0
2926,lame b horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her when said lodger is killed off mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities br br my main complaint is that this film should have brought the funny it failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the b movie crowd happy i've seen worse but i wouldn't give this one a rec 4 5 10,0
2927,what a shocker for starters i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying the jerky camera movements were also annoying the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot and then there's the ending i'm still not really sure what to make of it i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid br br the case had a couple of those little award winner nominations symbols on it so i figured it couldn't be too bad i was wrong if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf,0
2928,i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version i rather enjoyed it either way it wasn't that bad of a movie sure it moved a bit slow at times i liked it br br as far as mst3k goes they only did the movies they could get the rights for not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies it was just so easy to make fun of them take for example br br joe estevez and robert characters where so inanimate and boringly silly i couldn't help but laugh i couldn't take them seriously it really created a unique feeling though br br vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today her role was played well not too not to masculine but just right the camera really likes her in this movie i would have casted her in that role after ready the script br br anyways this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k it deserves that much,0
2929,having grown up in new jersey and having spent many a day and night on the gritty streets of new york in the 1970's watching a film like the seven ups or its kindred spirit the french connection always evokes fond memories of a time and place which for some might have been darkest hour but which for me in my early twenties was always one fun filled adventure after another i truly miss those times as one reviewer remarked this film very aptly captures the stark cold matter of fact feel of the nyc winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing a great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture a spot on characterization of both the film and the city the stellar attributes of this film the plot the cast the characters and of course the car chase are amply described in many of the reviews here so i won't go into that except to say that one of my favorite moments occurs during the car chase when the camera focuses on richard lynch riding shotgun to the maniacal bill hickman the look of horror on richard lynch's face along with the defensive gestures are so out of character for an actor much better known as a source of terror rather than an object of it that it is actually comical to watch i get a chuckle out of it every time,1
2930,millions in gold is traveling by train to the us treasury traveling along is lois lane to report on it along the way the train is attacked by masked thieves they detach the car with the armed guards in it and attack the remaining ones this leads to a vicious fight between the remaining guards and the thieves the thieves overpower them but then lois lane jumps in she beats the thieves off the train at one point using a gun but the train starts to careen out of control lois can't stop it and the thieves will stop at nothing to get the gold good thing superman is on the way br br fast exciting non stop action probably one of the best of all the cartoons just great,1
2931,i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor england br br the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie br br first there were too many cut's between important parts and leaving out important events which happened at the time one is henry's fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from rome and establishing her own church they barely stuck to the book at all i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point in the book mary birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born both their father is henry's the eight in the movie they show harry's first then catherine and suggest that catherine father is william carey br br there are too many bad moment's in the movie to write them all br br i will however say that may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie br br if you haven't read the book and know nothing about the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for it's lack of details and important plot's,0
2932,pat conroy's autobiographical book the water is wide proves to be something of a southern up the down staircase yet despite the teacher going against the odds formula really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash these students uneducated black kids on an island off south carolina are actually shown learning and their collective wide eyed innocence is remarkably sweet the one actual actress in the bunch tina andrews an amazing performer plays the tough nut has to crack and once she falls under his charms it all seems a breeze but the story is not ready made for a happy ending and i wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale it's beautifully done the script veers off course every now and then but director martin ritt is very smart to always fall back on jon voight's solid presence scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion and the actual ending is their payoff 1 2 out of,1

2934,i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie for example the names of some serbian terrorists that i remember are and leo what kind of names are that certainly not serbian by the way what a name i laughed for days thinking about it probably an implication on karadzic and secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians a journalist like the main character ought to have known that thirdly the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo croatian all this aside this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes at times it makes no sense whatsoever,0
2935,i have just returned from santa fe i visited chapel as i looked around this building which has been acquired by a private owner i relived the movie version of the staircase it is an overwhelming mystique that occupies this building it is about what can happen if you really have faith the bookstore there has a narrative on the subject which is the story of the staircase i read the narrative in its entirety i was absorbed by the ambiance surrounding the people therein it was like we were totally enclosed in a time warp all with the same thoughts and awe when we departed the hush was overwhelming everyone should visit chapel in santa fe,1
2936,this is by far the best movie i've seen in a long while it is a wholly original and beautiful plot it is not boring nor is it too dramatic the characters are tangible and realistic but it does not take away from the story line the fact that is not in english is most likely the final touch the end leaves you fulfilled in a way i've never experienced in a movie before br br i wish i had found this movie earlier br br more lines br br more lines br br more lines a lot more lines c'mon i'm done,1
2937,i am truly sad that this is the first bad review i've ever made for a movie ever i could stand to watch this movie and it is the second movie in all the movies i've seen that is just a downgrade the first is open water that just had no point whatsoever the next karate kid didn't have any mention of daniel correct me if i'm wrong please and that ending line came as a shock it was like if must fight win then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing and i was like oh okay so it'll take a while for this next part and then the credits hit the screen br br geez man hopefully i will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again i apologize for those of you who like the next karate kid i really really do,0
2938,i must admit that this is one of the few lou costello films that i actually saw in the theater most have now been seen on t v and i must admit that lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girl too this was my first time seeing dorothy perform and of course i fell in love with her like so many others that day i have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one her performance in the great race is one of the reasons i bought the disc in the first place br br every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that lou costello did with out bud abbott which is true but if lou had lived he would have made many more he really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on his old routines to get laughs i for one am sorry that the little man from patterson n j didn't get the chance to do that br br i hope this comes out on dvd some time so i can add it to my comedy sci fi collection,1
2939,it's not unusual that hollywood likes to pump out crappy films occasionally a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass it's also not surprising that those bad films are retreads of old tv series' occasionally a surprise pops up with the fugitive who saw that best picture oscar nom coming but for every fugitive there's a navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest the mod squad in my opinion goes into my top ten of truly lousy films in which hollywood should get it's sorry ass beaten for producing what could've been a good movie we're shifted right dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem to make sense it wastes the talent and the dialogue is just bad we don't actually know who the hell these characters are and we could give a flying f k about what they are instead you're expected to automatically know who they are and what they're going to do there's one particularly bad riff about the i'm too old for this s t line that's just plain stupid something my friend verbally noted when we were clamoring for the movie to just end it's just an insult to hollywood cinema grade f,0
2940,clever psychosexual drama about a wounded union soldier clint eastwood who seeks refuge in an isolated confederate school for young women during the civil war slowly eastwood begins to seduce every girl in sight until the tables are turned and he becomes the pursued in an unsettling gothic toned finale never has a film been so deliciously erotic yet disturbingly macabre at the same time br br this is undoubtedly eastwood's finest hour those who tune in for dirty harry will indeed be surprised while the rest of the cast gives uniformly superb performances try to see the film on video as television prints usually delete crucial flashback scenes between geraldine page and patrick,1

2943,this is a well directed columbo episode with also some good character but the story just doesn't really know to interest enough and doesn't appear as well layered and constructed as was often the case with a columbo movie this also goes for the killer's plot to kill his uncle it's quite simple and doesn't seem as well thought out perhaps this movie didn't really took itself serious enough since the atmosphere of the movie is mostly light at least when compared to different columbo movies br br for instance the movie features quite a large amount of comical relief mostly coming from the columbo character himself it makes the movie an enjoyable one to watch but it also gives you the feeling they sort of overdid it times also mostly since it doesn't correspond with most other columbo movies br br the characters are good and it helps that it features martin landau in a double role it's always funny to see how much different he still looked as a young man while for instance a person such as peter falk hardly changed any over the years he only got the movie also features julie newmar among others who is best know for playing catwoman in the '60's batman life action series it's funny how she still moves like catwoman in this movie intentional or is this just her way of acting br br it's an enjoyable and good to watch columbo movie but it also gives you the feeling that it all could had been a lot better with a better thought out script br br 7 10,1
2944,though stephen gyllenhaal is a good tv director with a few good full length to his credit homegrown is just a mess in its script and direction despite performances from billy bob john lithgow kelly lynch jon bon jovi jamie lee curtis and ted danson a cast this good couldn't save the film br br will know that jake and maggie are in the film but you don't see jake very well and maggie's only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off lithgow's character about a bust it's not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be it just wasn't funny,0
2945,ok let's get this out of the way first as a piece of cinema lifeforce is rubbish as a bit of cheesy entertainment for sf buffs it's got a lot of merit if you enjoy watching those old black and white sf b movies giant mutated spiders ant or alien monsters wandering around the desert you really will get a kick out of lifeforce br br bad things the story makes little sense and the acting is pretty poor good things the special effects are halfway decent it has a different british centered story it's set in london which gives different feel to most sf movies and it has the well endowed mathilda may amusingly billed as space girl wandering around stark naked br br in short it's fun br br i've seen it half a dozen times now and every time it comes on tv i make time to watch it admittedly this is partly to do with the naked ms may but it's also to do with the enjoying a bit of unassuming and silly sf,1

2947,mr bean has always been my favorite no matte how many times you watch the same thing the show never gets monotonous or repetitive mr bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh his gestures his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch the situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater there is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are 1 when mr bean at a hotel 2 the one where he watches the scary film 3 mind the baby the diaper scene especially in fact all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show mr bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing 10 out of 10,1
2948,business vs personal conviction profit vs art br br as with any documentary that pits the capitalist large corporations against the small producer the viewer will invariably have to take the side of one or the other based on their own believes this is as much a documentary of the new standardized way of doing things that globalization is bringing us against the old traditional ways where character and the art of making things matters almost more than getting the product sold br br if you have to remember one thing from this movie it is that the masses can no longer decide by themselves they just follow the taste of one or a couple of critics that tend to and standardize taste in the same way as used to do for the fast bite something parker himself admits to in the film against a backdrop of a burger king sign it is all about image against content as another interviewee says that is the easy way the standardized way easier than taking the time for a nice wine to mature easier than to forge your own taste by trying and trying yet over again controlled branded taste is easier br br there is a glitter of hope when even some of our cousins across the ocean agree that a few people are levelling the taste of to maximize the profits and ensure a maximum of it gets sold to the grey masses individuality and difference is sacrificed for the extra buck it is nice to see that not everything or everyone is giving in to standardization even across the ocean br br as in many other areas of today's world dominance of a few and reduced freedom of choice impacts us all let everyone make up their mind and decide what to go for too much standardization kills the mind and taste difference brings innovation and healthy competition and will allow for choice and not just vacuum packed more of the same standardization sells easily and a lot and brings everyone to the same level the lower one br br on this i am going to open up a nice bottle and wish you a,1
2949,ordinarily i love these stranger within thrillers some good examples are fatal attraction single white female and audition done well they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares of course the opposite can be true done poorly they can be tedious and stupid the hand that rocks the cradle is one of the latter br br the claire annabella sciorra and michael matt mccoy are welcoming another member to their family but busy claire is persuaded by michael to hire a nanny one day a woman named peyton flanders rebecca shows up and because she seems perfect the hire her of course once she shows up their idyllic life is slowly unraveling br br this film suffers from a plethora of problems but the biggest one is the handling of the villain peyton is never believable part of this has to do with how she's written and how she's acted the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that they're laughable de doesn't help much she portrays peyton as two different people while it's true she's supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies de performance creates a divide between the two facets of her character br br the other actors are good however annabella is terrific as the asthmatic claire sciorra is very natural in the role but unfortunately the script lets her down matt mccoy is almost invisible however julianne moore is delightful as claire's friend marlene moore is a firecracker but unfortunately she's only on screen for a total of five minutes br br curtis hanson is a good director but you wouldn't know it from watching this dud the film has a few decent shocks but it's poorly paced and the climax while generating some tension is actually kind of laughable that being said he's working with a script that at best could charitably be called pathetic br br trust me when it comes to stick with fran this one should have gone to the direct to video bin,0
2950,i just saw this movie and all i can say is where are the drive in's these days this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies but it's only worth watching now if you're feeling nostalgic for the 70's silly plot that is full of holes but it does remind one of the era it was made in interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive though not much of an actress in fact there is not much acting going on in this movie at all it's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods but there is a comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one,0
2951,this movie was so cool i saw it on a friday night with a couple of my friends while the first credits were rolling we saw that lionsgate films had made this movie they are the ones that made that stupid movie wolf creek which was totally gay when we saw this we groaned we thought it was going to be like wolf creek but we were so wrong the movie was not only better than wolf creek which really isn't that hard it is one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time they really redeemed themselves with this movie it was gory smart and scary which are the combinations to an awesome horror movie kane is awesome as jacob goodnight and christina vidal samantha noble and luke did pretty good jobs as part of a group of delinquents cleaning an old motel it had some gross scenes and you actually kinda feel sad for some of the people who die all in all a great horror movie to watch on a friday or saturday night with the lights off and with friends just don't watch it in a hotel,1
2952,i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief i was even more shocked to see people the film in the comments section of this site this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever the people behind this should be bought to justice asap today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing nauseating indeed,0
2953,heart of darkness a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed corruption and traveling through africa was to say the least a tedious read the narrator follows marlow a seaman who travels into the deep of africa to rescue kurtz somewhat of a prodigy ivory trader who supposedly went crazy this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped coming into the main port the basis of the story is conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings he sets the scene wonderfully but possibly a bit to extensively the story seemed more like a water color painting as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out br br it sometimes happens that after you read a book maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book or vise versa not so with heart of darkness even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john malkovich the movie only confused me more there seemed to be no real main characters in the film no one stood out to the others non of the extensive symbolism was explained it was rather bland and to say the least br br in all do respect to the author the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece it touches on some very severe subjects the lies of marlow and the greed of kurtz it is not a book to be taken lightly and will put you in a rather somber mood a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people i would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending,0
2954,apparently this was an award winner apparently someone had a gun against his her head and was force to nominate maize the movie br br or this must have been a mistake br br this is the most unwatchable movie ever made the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask the little girls run into their hero dad and then runs away from him w t f the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this br br the girls obviously weren't trained actors and had no common sense to them they were so annoying and so infantile in the movie it not even remotely comedic hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left you can't even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions br br i can puke a better award winner than this garbage,0
2955,this is a good film no doubt but with some odd aspects without spoiling anything it takes place in 3 places only a sicilian farm the boat and ellis island new york all shots are close up so we never see a broad sweep of anything i wonder if this was to save money no street scenes anywhere and we don't even see the boat except in close ups and the music what on earth was going on with playing nina simone songs decades before they were out i could have done without the milk river business too but hey before you think of me as a pure misanthrope let me repeat this is a very good film with moments wonderful photography great characters and more accuracy than the usual american efforts at the immigration experience,1
2956,in a phrase moral ambiguity in the soderbergh remake there are good guys and bad guys benicio del toro's character is clearly the good guy morally clean and uncorruptable his counterpart in the bbc original the farmer turned dealer is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate the two relentless cops are similarly different in the american one they win our hearts in the bbc original they are over zealous nearly obsessive br br the best moment for me in soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the drug czar what would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs that point was insinuated throughout the bbc show and crystallized in jack lithgow's final speech both are excellent but the bbc towers over the remake my conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand and it is the demand that causes so much suffering,1
2957,alice florinda bolkan a translator living in italy discovers that she has a memory loss and can't recall the last couple of days she starts to follow a trace of memory fragments which leads her to the small town of people in the town seem to recognize her and she's beginning to suspect that the re occurring nightmares of astronauts conducting horrible experiments has something to do with her own amnesia br br the movie is interesting and the plot is good but it's a bit to slow moving and arty for my taste the plot takes some nice twists and it's really hard to figure out where it's heading florinda bolkan is good in her role but even better in flavia the heretic and it's always nice to see star child actor klaus kinski's role is too small though this is not a movie for the die hard gore hound or exploitation addict but still a very nice hour and a half mystery,1
2958,this movie was obviously made with a very low budget but did they have to make it so obvious it looked like they made no effort to make the future look in the least futuristic for example the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's i assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than 500 additionally its pretty obvious that don the dragon is driving his personal car during the movie after all he did partially fund the film finally they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new cyberpunk society not only does this never become important in the film but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine the whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic since don easily blows up an unstoppable about 25 minutes into the movie however if you find this movie cheap or free i'd watch it the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film,0
2959,focus is another great movie starring william h macy i first discovered macy in fargo and i've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me macy is the archetypal nice guy with something to hide in focus he plays the role of lawrence newman a loyal and hard working stiff who harbours his handicapped mother at home the scene is set after world war ii at the height of mccarthyism newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically anti semite after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent he is asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve his failing eyesight br br unbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart his wife played by a great laura dern as the film unravels newman will begin to see a whole different world where being jewish is akin to being an animal br br the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal the chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is,1
2960,i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star because the film has so many eye rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental br br the acting if you want to call it that is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed wood's actors appear life like sammy the lone black character must be husband in real life because he appears in her other films but he has zero acting ability his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character his old man make up in her other turkey pushed to the limit is no budget junior high school quality with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair br br i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand it really is beyond fear it's actually beyond funny,0
2961,i saw teen in 1993 in doordarshan on a friday night and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in bollywood it was mind blowing  a film with a modern storyline superb music three lovely ladies and my fave superstar dev anand in this unusual storyline dev falls in love with three women  the simple the ravishing and the sophisticated simi they too are enamored with him and want to marry him this puts dev in a dilemma which is the crux of the storyline whom to marry he consults a hypnotist who asks dev to gaze into a crystal ball dev finds the answer and marries beautifully directed most probably by dev himself not by the official director the b w classic has evergreen music  some of sd helped generously by rd burman best compositions uff hai yeh ruth is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in hindi films credit should also be given to for penning the memorable lyrics teen is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of dev anand and he did full justice to the role unfortunately teen has never received the recognition popularity it richly deserves br br a must see for any hindi film buff i will rate the eternal favourite 9 5 out of 10,1

2963,an excellent thoughtfully produced historical drama well played artfully written shot in ways that convey accurate visual images of the congo and with more than a few moving moments especially for those who care about the history of africa and imperialism however a fair amount of worthwhile content gets lost in translation and because names and so forth are hard to follow so i would strongly recommend checking a neutral source such as wikipedia to get a basic sense of the story being depicted and the subsequent history before enjoying the film if you have the dvd version there is also some useful historical background there is a point towards the end of the film where the name of a character who then speaks with an american accent is actually beeped out a simple google search of film censor or something similar will reveal a truly fascinating and perhaps disturbing twist regarding the production of this important film this film if coupled with a little outside research helps dozens of other films relating to central east africa and or imperialism e g hotel rwanda shake hands with the devil various adaptations of conrad's heart of darkness and even ali when mohammed ali visits,1
2964,oh my lord what were they thinking about with this one it not only is frantically unfunny but worse a very good original was trashed in the bargain jane fonda believe it or not actually turned in the performance of her life in that one even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life maybe she is just flat good as a crook any other time wow what a waste of time but she and segal team up beautifully so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from br br because very very very little of that one remains to this ones horror nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss and uhh oh my lord that's it well looks like it br br it truly is that bad a film,0
2965,this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the vcr or dvd player michael dudikoff and lisa howard are two bounty hunters in love yet they are total opposites she is ambitious and organized while he is laid back and totally scatter brained br br in this movie bad guys are chasing jersey character this opens the door to bad godfather impressions ludicrous fight scenes and tony curtis playing the most effeminate looking mob boss i have ever seen the ending has to be the most unbelievable scene i have seen in a movie in quite some time i would believe the terminator even the matrix has a better chance of possibly being true than this ending this movie just reeks of cheapness the script had to have hit someone as being totally ridiculous yet the green light was given for this piece of dung to be made and let loose on on unsuspecting public i watched this movie with several other people who all agreed that we had been cheated no one in the group could say anything good about the film except that it was over,0
2966,this film proves you don't need a hollywood budget to make something fun to watch what stuck with me is how the crew from different locations was able to pull together with no promises of riches to make something just because they believed in it i think anybody who makes low budget movies can relate to certain scenes such as actors who just can't get that one line being bothered by the police and having most of the crew disappear after the first week nobody got paid for this which says a lot for the people who had to travel cross country and for the long hours spent editing after watching sell his personal property use his own money and trash his house to make the movie i am a bit curious how close his wife may have come to leaving good job to all,1
2967,kingdom county vermont 1927 noel lord rip torn lives with his indian mate cardinal in the area where a large dam is to be built noel however is not willing to give up on his land and he'll have to fight the dam company in order to prevent the county from any possible destruction br br where the rivers flow north is a gripping contemplative story powered by the memorable performances of rip torn recently seen in the small but juicy role of louis xv in sofia coppola's underrated marie antoinette and cardinal dances with wolves smoke signals director jay craven who also co wrote the script with don based on howard frank novel and cinematographer paul ryan crafted this powerful story with unique contemplative pace visuals which remind me of terrence malick's and john huston's best moments it's an underrated independent period piece of the first electric half of the 90's usually regarded as the rise of quentin tarantino's burlesque pulp fiction is a masterpiece indeed but the man suffers from orson welles' syndrome todd disturbing suburbia danny boyle's dark vision of the uk let's not mention that beach flick with dicaprio though jay craven should be more regarded on the lists of great indie filmmakers as well he's been leading a respectful discreet career and it's always a pleasure to see a constant talent like his br br my vote 8 10,1
2968,nothing carson daly has ever said or done on this show has ever made me laugh or even smile a little i do not understand how this show has survived for so many years br br even the funny band member is just like one of those kids in high school who thinks nobody is good enough to even look at him daly and that dude are just arrogant frat boys it seems like they don't even try to be a little funny br br awful awful awful show br br it makes my soul cry br br i just cannot stress enough how awful this show is don't watch it but if you absolutely have to i recommend clawing your eyes out and clogging your ears with cement beforehand,0
2969,ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise a list veteran actors colorful flashbacks with nifty look a like youthful counterparts of the old men scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors atmospheric new england winter weather and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects and to presenting a more cogent screenplay we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer acolytes are in the script the biggest detriment of the film is craig definitely separated at birth from bill maher who from perhaps editing or just bad acting is totally ineffective he seems to specialize in wide eyed wide mouthed reaction shots not a lot of personality here the revelation however is alice krige pale faced enigmatic terrifying underneath the placid exterior however her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate i mean a young woman who says things like i'd like to take a bite out of you or dance with me you little toad is already not in the land of the living ghost story would have been much better in a low key val lewton mode the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor,0
2970,this film has an amazing cast mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien lionel barrymore edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home while they have amassed a fortune over the years they also have been selfish jerks one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name sort of like carnegie but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien and since she's an orphan they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great br br there also is a goofy subplot involving fairies led by the wonderful character actor henry davenport and since o'brien is irish as evidenced by her outrageous accent she and the little people make up much of the plot frankly i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely instead the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts this would have worked but the little people sheesh overall the actors try very very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe i noticed a lot of people liked this film i guess i'm just an old grouch i found the film horrible difficult to watch,0
2971,i love japanese movies having seen at least 100 200 so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films however sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to westerners they might be hits at home but abroad they just don't seem well normal it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating or things that are accepted there that confuse non japanese this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted such as american football fried snicker bars and paris hilton well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be yama now the style of animation isn't the issue it's different but nice enough no it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this there was a stingy man who for no apparent reason had a tree growing out of his head it was little at first and he simply cut it away but again and again it grew back so he just decided to let it go and after a while people began living on his head under the shade of the tree oddly while they were under the tree they were tiny but when they left they were full sized again then after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree the man drown himself in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was the end br br see i told you this was very very odd but not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakuris just odd o d d odd and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar nominated film did not win frankly that makes me happy as i really don't want this film to spur on such similar films the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice but not spectacular animation br br this film made my brain hurt i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree,0
2972,this is one of my favorite capra esque comedies this movie is just meant to be enjoyed not deconstructed microscopically analyzed it's not religious commentary it's fun it's fantasy the surprisingly negative comments imho reflect a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think must be a part of every movie br br others have described travolta's role it's the reason you'll watch the movie over and over and the excellent supporting cast including sparky br br sometimes a cigar is just a cigar sometimes a movie is just fun br br enjoy,1
2973,it's a movie with a theatrical message blended with some clever moments films like these are the stretching grounds of great actors they enjoy tossing the ball in open pieces like these the angel that wasn't what we see in old books and churches is quite a nice change it is echoed in kevin smith's piece dogma almost in the same slapstick vein br br 0 watch this film for a good day after you suck it all in could it be that so many films are trying to be complicated that we forget the simple movements of films like this possibly one of the most fun pieces i have seen in a while i ran into this one on vhs in a trash can because someone's basement was flooded this summer and i grabbed a handful of tapes br br whether in a trash bin or on the silver screen mild comedies like this are fun you just don't have to tell everyone at a hip nightclub that you like it or a swank political party just keep it for yourself and i'll bet plenty of people will borrow it from time to time,1
2974,just see it it's a smart movie but too hard to understand the first time see it more than once everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally crafted to evoke a feeling sensation or tone the clarity of certain visuals and the of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurred images or pops crackles hisses and barely audible sounds the structure is non linear and cyclical motifs recur as time runs both and expectations regarding plot and character are broken signaling a non traditional use of film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity this is a part of a review usa the movie is emotionally intense intellectually intriguing and profoundly disturbing in surprising and unconventional ways dion dennis phd,1
2975,graphically it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun br br the ps1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks the dreamcast version which is rarely seen anymore was the best version of the 4 versions xbox eventually came out with a 5th with it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the ps1 and n64 could handle br br the levels are really amazingly done from start to finish like the first one the school was my favorite i enjoyed that level so much not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length that's what i liked about the first two games they don't make these games graphically enhanced they just focused on length of levels which is cool br br overall just as good as the first one and well worth playing,1
2976,it's hard to believe a movie can be this bad but you live and learn what's more amazing is the fact that the people who put this thing together likely had college meanwhile the fruit of their labor bares the appearance of something a group of five eighth graders may have come up with on the bright side if there is one the soundtrack has some nice moments which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so hideously bad,0
2977,where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess i'll start with the story the story for komodo vs cobra number one it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears all in all terrible piece of crap don't even think about renting it,0
2978,i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story the majority of the scenes looked fake to me for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect this movie was not realistic at all it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the st experiment took place i believe that the house may be haunted but not on the night this movie was filmed the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement paul and madison found them and rescued them i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st experiment movie again as i said if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project even though this is not a true story either,0
2979,ok when i was little and i mean like 2 or 3 not 6 and 7 barney was one of my favorite shows i then grew out of it and threw all my old barney tapes away so one day as i'm flipping through channels i see that barney now takes place in a and i thought um huh is this the right show once i realized it was i freaked why did they change the show's setting from a school to a ever since then the show has been absolutely terrible and the only reason i'm giving it a 2 is a because i'm nice b because of riff and c because in the old times the show was tolerable now i just hate it hate it br br 2 10,0
2980,so it's not an award winner so what have you ever wanted to see a film that was just silly the villain and this one could top the list my husband says that jekyll and hyde together again is one of those movies that if you've been there and done that you'll think this spoof on the 80's cocaine culture is a riot i think the whole film is just fun nothing is sacred hospitals plastic surgery howard hughes there are ongoing gags that you have to watch for to appreciate to say that the film doesn't follow the book would be true but then a lot of really good films take liberties with the published word also i recommend this movie to all the old stoners among us we may be smarter now but we will still recognize and laugh at many folks we knew ourselves back in the old days,1
2981,this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right without muscles you really can't move your hands but he did the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended it had something to do with foam or something,0
2982,if one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well i cannot remember one funny scene though i have to admit i had to turn it off before it was finished i did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well if you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply,0
2983,i saw the film many times and every time i am more and more disappointed which is shame because the films from ex yu are usually very good the shame here is that tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea my self coming from the balkans macedonia found this film disappointing simply that the bosnian characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed to understand the mentality of a person from ex yu you need to know their background way of live what makes them cry and laugh and the director of the film didn't took that as guideline when we ex yu make films lots of symbolism is build in it which makes the characters recognisable and likable and mostly portraying the truth if it is based on true story the films like village pretty flame tito and me' no mans land' before the rain black cat white cat otac na sluzbenom putu when father was away on business ko to tamo peva who sings over there rare the masterpiece of the balkan cinematography and nothing can compare to it not the half baked story of and studio as somebody from the panel mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american armchair variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too and some of them live on the balkans and sarajevo too and to add insult to the injury half of the things are shoot in macedonia where i come from my shock when i saw the broad st of in the opening scene of the film when the bride is shoot from the sniper and what was that inserting real footage of the news covering in the film anyway very disappointing as the truth is far away from the film shame that nobody consulted the real people how is to live in sarajevo under fire before they shoot the film book is one thing and real life is other and this film lets down both,0
2984,although i haven't seen it yet i know that chaplin is a genius and only someone of his talent would take on this daring subject matter a comedy about hitler all great satire is based on going out on an edge also all great comedy deals with the other side pathos this film seems like it will skirt both sides like kubrick's dr strangelove the great dictator deals with history through the distorted lens of satire the only way to deal with the horrors of this world is by laughing at it and hopefully through laughter we can learn to view the world in a new light another film that does this that comes to my mind is emir kusturica's underground and fando and lis so let me watch the film first,1
2985,a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed the plot is hardly unique see spielberg's 'poltergeist' 1982 within a short time they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it,0
2986,this was one of the best half hour horror suspense fantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values i e the sets went but darn it i have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots i mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even i a hardened horror movie shock film and 70's grind house buff got a little sickened and creeped out great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here my favorite episode was called bug house yeah that was the title i think anyhow it still gives me the willies every time i think about it to this day almost 20 years after it first premiered other shows like tales from the darkside the outer limits and of course the twilight zone were definitely better production values wise but in my opinion they ain't got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show it definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was tales from the crypt,1
2987,somewhere in usa the young clair manipulates her friends mic billy and john showing a letter that would be sent by bob to her and the group cowardly beats bob and mic kills him with a piece of wood in the forest mic feels sorrow and decides to tell his mother what he did but john and billy threaten him with tragic consequences br br i believe the wind is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the awful screenplay is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary since there is no story or plot only sequences of disconnected scenes the amateurish direction and acting are amazingly poor and terrible it is unbelievable how producers invest money in such garbage distributors release this crap worldwide and viewers like me buy this dvd i waited until the very last scene because i was curious to see how bad this film could be and i was impressed since it is worse than i could imagine in my lowest expectations in the end i question why imdb does not offer zero in the vote system since the garbage really deserves this vote my vote is one br br title brazil invisible force,0
2988,starting with a my name is joe like scene in alcoholics anonymous careers into a mad spiral of infidelity double standards and clandestine affairs but what do you expect from a family of lawyers br br a genuinely funny film with some of the most outrageous characters since the birdcage plot and subplot are intertwined with surreal scenes of decadent parisian life ever been to a wedding reception in the gents toilet where the brides grandmother and her deranged girlfriend are smoking dope and cracking blue jokes no me either leading to a final scene of almost symbolism br br excellent,1
2989,i suppose i'm supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt these laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time of course they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that dr frankenstein's did there is always something they didn't anticipate there are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that don't work here the young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor can't help himself but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing things go wrong and because of this intellect she gains tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be rock hudson looks pretty fit here he never quite makes it in this role however it wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way,0
2990,just like all of mel brooks' other comedies men in tights is hilarious but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well elwes is the well spoken former british noble lewis is an eternally annoyed king i hope it's worth all the deluise is a fantastic godfather roger rees is a worried and cynical sheriff the actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease yes we've seen this kind of comedy before but the only comedy to achieve better character development in my opinion is the big lebowski very very funny,1
2991,this is a road movie at least the movie is in yellow i think that suggests a road movie i can't say much positive about the delivery it's bad acting certainly their english camera looks like it is done by a kid there's a bomb with counter and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky since it was so cliche we actually the whole time and that was the most fun of the movie this movie should be released in america but i'm not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce the explosions look boring basically everything is over the top everything is just too much the yellow quality the sound the babe etc find all the cliche part in other movies put them together and you have the delivery,0
2992,i completely forgot that i'd seen this within a couple of days which is pretty revealing in itself the umpteenth version of gaston 'phantom of the opera' locked door country house mystery i had heard that it was an engaging and witty update so it appeared from the likable title sequence and a few neat touches in the opening scene but the film very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely tedious and wholly unsatisfying br br as a mystery the major problem is that it is fundamentally by the audience like the worst agatha it depends on a character appearing in the final act with a wealth of background information that we have not been privy to as a film be it comedy or thriller the crucial problem is that characterisation is almost non existent with the exception of the killer everyone is a face value version of the typical suspects in the typical country house murder story reporter endangered heiress suspicious fiancé scatterbrained scientist father a surprisingly poor michel etc there's no depth and little of interest and the frequently over ripe or misjudged performances don't help you frankly don't care about anyone in it so there's no jeopardy or suspense only claude rich and in the last reel pierre arditi get anything to work with and only in the last reel does the film get close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective br br for the rest we get endless exposition and a couple of ineffective would be comic set pieces a promising one with a photographer trapped inside a grandfather clock is just too poorly thought through to pay off with dennis reduced to irving the for the last third of the picture i'm not fond of country house movies or agatha christie style so those who are might it a lot more slack but i found it a poor show as rich says when the mystery is revealed it's all rather something of a disappointment,0
2993,making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor br br what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed br br i don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show br br the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social political commentary br br my overall impression was that the film was rushed thematically under developed and visually not up to standard on a positive note the performances and music were very good,0
2994,if you ever visited acres as a child and wondered could there be a worse vacation spot in the world well you could have watched this movie and had your answer flavia a k a dude ranch is often frequented by business casual gordon at least since resident water witch jessica was 13 but jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that rod  buried tray shure lost jewelry dead bodies even a talisman that will keep her from dressing like a slut and raising drinks with a phony beat and a suzanne pleshette look alike while hypnotized by a disembodied head evil evil evil,0
2995,like the 5 year old protagonists of his latest opus hayao miyazaki's enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process miyazaki recalling his earlier works paints a brightly colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors br br voiced lovably by a fish with a young girl's face making her look like a cuddly child in a pink overgrown halloween costume escapes away from her underwater home and her school of siblings to explore the surface stranded ashore she is rescued by a five year old boy who along with his mom risa yamaguchi resides in a house on the nearby cliff this initial encounter and eventually friendship has a profound effect on who now wishes to become human but by becoming so inadvertently tips nature's balance and unleashes a maelstrom on land with help must pass a test to lift this curse and completely become a human br br despite the plot lacking the philosophical sophistication of say his most recent spirited away is nothing short of an astounding follow up characterized by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic and of the simple joys and great fears it's a straightforward tale that though at times stalled by its tendency to ramble like a toddler keeps in tune with its youthful pedigree to magically enthrall i will protect you tells matter of factly a childlike assertion not unlike the manner in which miyazaki endows his story with artful spirit,1
2996,i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap dr zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality there was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners all the guys had those 'too proud to take attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake the concept and deaths were really cool but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed read the spoiler at the end nothing else is really revealed though the ending is the biggest cop out you've ever seen i predicted everything before it happened including who would die and how the dialogue is lacking and that's an understatement by far there's mostly just random yelling thoughtful staring and chunky sentences the actors are just god awful i don't want to talk about this movie anymore it's making me angry i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done br br spoiler alert save 5 dollars the monster is just a bunch of ants that evolved so now they need bones so they can move around nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever and that the ants just killed whoever was available though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity this movie made me dumber the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant a big blob thing which destroys all the other ants pretty cliche eh he almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother thing that overcomes him give me a break,0
2997,why watch a tv drama billed as a comedy in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people i can sort of see what the writer david was trying to achieve the and bad taste surprises that he put into one foot in the grave etc i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment but really who cares about these people they are cold bores br br another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex boyfriend shagging that was the moment when i switched off this programme never to return br br p s it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone br br p p s good news for those who liked it there will be a second series in autumn 2007 though without the male lead it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom,0
2998,this has got to be the worse move i've ever seen it was not only boring it was gag me with a spoon dumb where'd ya find the actors on a street corner who did the special effects for god's sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone and if that wasn't bad enough you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life who ever did the makeup for the aliens must have spent 5 at your local used costume store and called it a day and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot it's not even 1 8 of what it is described as that description is just to suck people in to buying renting or paying a ticket to see it no wonder there was never a trailer to it ya would have drove them all away br br bad actors 5 br br special effects 5 50 br br fake fire 1 89 cigarette lighter br br time spent watching this movie total waste i should sue ya for my time watching it,0
2999,this is no walk in the park i saw this when it came out and haven't had the guts to watch it again you will never see a more horrifyingly devastating or depressing movie i felt like i'd been severely beaten what kind of world are we living in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage this is our world what we have created what we have allowed to happen and i would hesitate to say that i me we are not responsible for this made this film to wake us up to shake us to our very core and he succeeded how can we be cruel or self indulgent or neglectful of our children when we see the graphic results of such behavior he is pointing a finger of accusation at us all for doing this to the lowliest and least powerful of our society and if you aren't doing something each day to prevent it then you are part of the problem i am not a religious fanatic but this movie made me think about the state of my soul,1
3000,solo is an action movie about a terminator like android that is constructed and trained for the military when a flaw is discovered he is issued to be rather than face death he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america where he takes refuge in a village the military chases him into there leading into a big action feast br br mario van peebles does a decent performance the android his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero and it works out the action scenes aren't that spectacular but they aren't all too bad either the acting from the other characters is pretty bad but i was not expecting anything too good the special effects were decent as well br br solo is decent as an action flick but very forgettable it lacks the substance that most movies possess but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking this will get the job done,0

3002,only three words are really required for this review piece of crap br br if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor br br yes they do use all of the names and catch phrases the even name the dog in reference to the dog being boy in the cartoon they name the love interest polly but she isn't miss sweet polly br br my wife and son drug me to see this they should have drugged me to see it br br the original underdog was voiced by wally cox the ultimate nerd this one is voiced by someone with a smart teenager that knows more than all the adults attitude br br as a stand alone movie it is awful as an homage to underdog it is even worse it is not an homage it is not a retelling of the story it is not an updating of the story it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising the next time i go to the store i fear that i will see underdog toys pajamas towels sheets clothing etc mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this br br the worst part of this movie however is the soundtrack they do the underdog theme song to rap read that with a silent c at the beginning great now that we are going to destroy something let's go all the way br br i knew that it would probably be bad before i went my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium and one of only four without stadium seating even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd it will be more entertaining and have better production values,0
3003,woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic an american werewolf in london was indisputably a gem of a movie humorous demented with just a dash of romance and so very very british it made me want to stand up and sing god save the queen every time the movie ended then came this abomination you know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered and actually start cheering for the tell you the truth folks i only got about half way through this cgied travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time,0
3004,in this peculiar movie the themes of the end of days and satan versus jesus are treated in a new fashion jesus doesn't want to open the two last seals and satan is thwarted in his attempt to get another soul into hell armageddon armageddon and turns out to be a company and the book of life is a little hard to open br br what's memorable about this movie are the slanted image out of focus shots and light effects which are effective but sometimes irritating and of course donovan is great as a disillusioned jesus trying to come to terms with what the world and its people have become so do see it if you get the opportunity,1
3005,so americans make t v series based on movies whilst us brits make films based on t v shows it should never work but on this occasion it does because of a sublime meeting of character and actor cliches are sometimes justly so and leonard was born to play this is one of the great comic creations kind of how norman bates would have turned out if he'd been melancholic instead if murderous,1
3006,for a squadron leader normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot no matter how close a friend he is in the face of oncoming enemy troops is hard to believe especially when they both have to share a cramped spitfire cockpit two into a ok but a spit come on this part of the film is a adventure not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously as said by s eriksson gothenburg sweden is rubbish not at all one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots who planned and flew illegally a strafing mission over france one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire while german infantry was moving in on them and flew them both out of there in a spit they were both severely injured in former fights one had an artificial leg from the knee down now that may sound like something out of but it happened ill get sources if needed,1
3007,the majesty of ramin second feature is that like the work of a poet he portrays the very soul of humanity and lets it flourish on the screen beyond the scope of most other indie films out there chop shop is wise exuding the very best of the great cinema of the ages we can look back at the works of bresson and pasolini and compare work to theirs and yet chop shop is fresh and urgent to modern society we can see the workings of a master here  a certain sense of beauty style and content all merge together in a film that reminds us what it means to be alive instead of focusing on the side of nyc we so often see we live and breathe with our young hero alejandro in the destitute point  a fascinating quasi sub world of our culture  and yet it's a very very real place trying to stay afloat alejandro has to support himself and his older sister watch this film and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that leads us toward  all with profound and concise realism,1
3008,i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation unfortunatly it was misplaced firstly this is not horror it doesn't scare and unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for which is possible doesn't try to it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1 this film of gremlins in a truly special way i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more very very bad avoid,0
3009,the only reason i bought the dvd was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when liz kim basinger strips to the music of joe cocker you can leave your hat on that was the best part of the whole film not because the scene was any good only the song i am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good disappointingly so br br especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels from one idea to the other for example when john played by rourke is able to leave her on the top of the big wheel liz kim basinger is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of john's sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing liz and like one reader mentioned that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing this dangerous side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong the theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well is the film sending the message out that this kind of foreplay is fine if the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point instead the film awkwardly jumps from one sizzling scene of rourke feeding basinger and her to another in a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is maybe trying to relate thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas,0
3010,if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost for many years gem i doubt you will be disappointed ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultra cool blaxploitation even hints of slapstick but it's so odd that it was not only ahead of it's time nothing has been seen like it since br br i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated especially with spike lee's sp a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message good filmmaking disjointed script br br robert direction is brilliant allowing many of his actors to improvise the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss one liners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy to sheer non pc 'i can't believe they just said that' fun br br favorite parts the commercials the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful perhaps 16mm color and gets away with it br br i refuse to hint at any spoilers but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview but leave it until after the movie br br my vote 10 10 most underrated film of the late 60's early 70's thank you prince,1
3011,greta garbo stars in a very early 1930 mgm the first time talks' is a powerful movie but not for everyone the movie is filmed like a stage play short on sets and cinematography long on dialogue and dramatic characterizations eugene o'neil who wrote the play is known for his dark work and garbo's character anna christie is a bleak figure with a tortured past br br the sound quality on the dvd was mediocre not helping matters is that george f marion who plays anna's estranged dad chris is verbally hard to understand marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seamen who’s teetering on insanity with his fixation of the evil 'devil sea' but his dialogue is written with a very heavy swedish accent this is true to original play marie dressler's dialogue as marthy owens is equally hard to understand dressler believably portrays a broken down old drunken women a her dialogue also is true to original play as is charles bickford as the irish seamen matt burke who pursues anna in a troubled relationship garbo is actually the easiest to understand br br the films strong point is greta garbo she delivers a gut wrenching performance as the victim of neglect and abuse leading to a life of prostitution garbo was a huge star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in hollywood here her look isn't glamorous it's tortured her body posture nearly doubles over in agony she her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen garbo conveys these angst ridden feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery br br this is dark subject matter and garbo brings it to life it’s not light fare not fun not for everyone is strong emotions dredged up from the depths for examination this is one helluva ride,1
3012,this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen br br casting richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself supporting cast not too memorable br br story the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting the story is weak not enough happens to make a movie about there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here br br the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive br br not destined to be a great one to remember,0
3013,now i like johnny vegas which is a good start i also enjoy toilet humour br br such as young ones and bottom etc this however failed to bring even a br br small smile to my face the story follows johnny around after his wife br br chucks him out how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know br br as he attempts to shag anything that moves failing normally i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste br br of my time altogether unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother br br,0
3014,witticisms colorful characters family relationships coping with hardships living with fun and humor this film has it all and more what a great 'every man and woman ' story with a top notch plot and script it offers just clean fun lots of laughter many smiles and pure entertainment for the whole family other reviewers describe the story some i'll just offer this comparison teaser  it's part best of show grumpy old men millions and some other comedy and life flicks rolled into one br br this gem of a film most likely had limited release and is probably not very available to rent but it's now out on dvd and i highly recommend it for purchase if you like good old fashioned fun and entertaining films for the family you can't miss with manna from heaven this film is a sure fire cure for the blues or to chase the gloom away on nasty weather days or rough times,1
3015,this is a movie with an excellent concept for a story but that got sidetracked but a large number of clichéd sub plots hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances and some frankly implausible and highly coincidental and not to mention convenient as plot points to move the story to its inexorable finish br br the lack of anything that marked the lead as actually gay other than some coincidental references to crow bar or that he's gay was troubling it wouldn't have hurt to actually show him do something even if it was just meet a friend for drinks br br it's worth checking out and has it's merits there isn't much even now a few years after the movie was released in the way of movies that feature both a lead that is gay or a significant gay plot line and that is also about african americans for that it's worth checking out i wouldn't look too hard for it and i wouldn't waste my time looking for it to own this is a rental and not a premium rental at that,0
3016,the first full length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half hour show which aired on television br br wallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from people's vegetable gardens and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once they're caught of course as in other wallace and gromit films things don't quite work out as planned br br similarly to a close shave there's a love interest for wallace in this case the village lady posh and a big mean villain with a bullish dog gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny and of course peter provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fit br br and as in a grand day out cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves along br br on the negative side this film is a little on the long side there are great effects and some pieces which make you sit up and watch but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature length,1
3017,i think that just sums up this film watch it and you'll find out why the acting of the lead character john is really really bad and he has no on screen charisma whatsoever it's very funny because of this thought as is the ending where beheads the bad guy despite the fact he is unarmed and has surrendered brilliant,1
3018,black water has to be one of the best australian movies i've seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how director's andrew and david wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film,1
3019,a tight knit musical family cranky benevolent father and four vivacious adolescent daughters is up rooted by first the appearance of felix a dashing young composer and secondly and most profoundly mickey his attractive friend br br it takes a while for michael curtiz to get this piece of americana floating the first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal commercial not without a certain quaint highly bourgeois charm and then john garfield enters the scene as the doomed mickey making his first appearance in motion pictures with mussed up black curls sleepy hung over eyes rude and disheveled the absolute opposite to jeffrey lynn's smoothly persuasive madly charming felix garfield is in complete and direly needed counterpoint to the rest of the household nothing i would do would surprise me he muses and suddenly the movie becomes interesting although i agree with critics that find the plot turns insufficiently motivated br br the four sisters are rather blandly played and seriously underwritten but claude rains as the has his moments br br watch it for garfield though he is the only really lasting thing about it,1
3020,farscape totally rules in my opinion it's very close to babylon five although there are only 7 main characters in the series spaceship included the humour is excellent and the writers manage to keep the show interesting though pretty much everything happens on the ship br br what i really love and appreciate in is that they don't use cgi for the alien characters or if they do it's unnoticeable they use those lovable crappy rubber animatronic puppets very similar to the ones used in the original star wars br br farscape is something you definitely want to look into if you already haven't,1
3021,previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than i could what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually just gorgeous br br if you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art br br on a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give it about an 8 75 the only reason i shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece if you are in the mood for a really artistic very romantic film then it's a 10 i definitely think it's a must see but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall 8 75,1
3022,this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film won't be seen by many but for fans of 80's horror it's a must,1
3023,riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the la brea tar pits in los angeles even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog nonsensical plot contrivances and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen br br i have a theory every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his her career this was tommy lee jones's turn although he makes a decent effort the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames oops sorry about that most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing a few of the actors simply phone in their roles anne heche deserves special hall of shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist she is about as convincing in this role as pee wee herman and even he would have at least done a better acting job br br since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here i would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends and have a game of find the scientific absurdities the loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like everybody looks the same over and over here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect a scheme to blow up a building is devised engineered and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about 20 minutes br br let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clichés divorced dads scientists who get ignored by everybody obnoxious cops tough street kids bratty teenagers greedy investors etc all are present and in abundance the film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness br br for fans of cheese and silliness only all other viewers beware,0
3024,i went into this film expecting a slasher and while mute witness does take influence from said style of film making this is much more than just your average slash flick there are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability blindness is more common blind terror wait until dark cat o'nine tails to name a handful but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of our mute witness is billy hughes a make up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in moscow she finds herself locked in after hours one night and after attempting to phone her sister for help she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick but soon turns out to be a snuff movie she tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen but finds that no one believes her story br br recently hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country but this film did it first and actually does a better job it's maybe not quite as nasty as eli roth's opus but the gore is more effective and since director anthony waller who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'the implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings mute witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch the director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides as this one never stands still the plot is put into action quickly and waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film the acting isn't bad for a b movie with young performers marina fay ripley and evan richards delivering good performances the atmosphere is gritty and the russian locations are suitably unfriendly which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere overall mute witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be the plot flows well and the atmosphere and tension are spot on,1
3025,this movie came out about the same time as pretty woman while the general theme is the same wealthy man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman the characters of and juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them i have never forgotten them and consider the movie superior to pretty woman in so many ways juliette is a remarkable woman and the clever ways she helps her boss overcome his problems will make you cheer the final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in romantic comedy the efforts makes to win the love of juliette surpass the puny climbing scene of pretty woman a hundred times over see this movie it will warm your heart,1
3026,i was looking forward to this flick being an old robert e howard fan mainly from a conan stand point br br i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much oh dear how wrong was i br br the main flaw was it was fairly dull it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goings on sword fights and the like br br you got some gore but everything else was just pretty life less the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development br br on the plus side costumes and effects were fine but not enough to keep your interest br br i think it would have been better to tone down the gore up the tempo and go for a 12a rating as a ten year old boy i may have liked this movie probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film br br or go really art house with tone direction etc but that's fairly high risk as far as box office is concerned br br oh well perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it,0
3027,this miniseries is a reasonable sequel to the original gone with the wind if one views this on its own merit and not immediately following the original it comes out pretty good i am sure that most viewers will question the performances of scarlett and rhett but it seems unlikely that anyone else could have done better many of the characters here are new to this storyline so comparison in those cases mother uncle henry hamilton will is not a problem no one will every be vivien leigh or clark gable br br the best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of springtime charleston and ireland watch it for that alone obviously this was a high budget tv miniseries it follows the book for a while then has a totally new plot when scarlett goes to ireland br br the acting is credible if nothing special kind of the way i feel about roger moore following sean connery for james bond,1
3028,the original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping film but failed miserably in this version as even cherie was a pale imitation of what she was to become so much so that i suspected that she must turn out to be an accomplice right to the end sherlock holmes was turned into a warrior quite unlike anything every suggested by sir arthur conn doyle in fact it was doctor watson who showed what little common sense that was going the boot blacked midget from the islands looked as though he could not fight his way out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing taking tea in baker street for a denouement was beyond anything that the old scotland yard could ever have dreamed up so consign this tv film to their black museum please,0
3029,a vampire prince falls for a human girl unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter that's the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from underworld and buffy the vampire slayer but manages to maintain a style of its own i was bemused by the uk and hong kong title the twins effect as there are no twins involved in the story it turns out that the two main female characters are played by hong kong pop stars who perform as the twins don't let this put you off these girls can act at least well enough for this type of film and add a lot of charm to the proceedings jackie chan turns up for a couple of cameo appearances adding a dash of his own brand of slapstick mayhem to the proceedings all in all this is great fun for those who like their vampires served up with a helping of tongue in cheek humour,1
3030,i went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released i was 11 at the time i remember how much i enjoyed it and wanted to live in shangri la that's how naive and young i was i recently came across a video of the film i had recorded off television some years ago i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did 29 years ago i also enjoy listening to the words of the songs because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection we should be happy with what we see this is what i call a feel good film because i feel happy after watching it maybe i am still naive but it makes me happy and i'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is a good family film i must be one of the few people who has this film on vhs pal video and dvd self made i recorded it on dvd as the videotape recording from tv was starting to wear thin i still watch it from time to time,1
3031,this is one of those films that looks so dated that being that way is part of the fun you see and hear things you would never see or hear on the silver screen today some of that is good some it too corny for words some of it bad depending on your viewpoints on certain cultural issues br br for instance in this short 68 minutes 1931 film you have br br the grandpa of the family that is featured in this story extolling the value of patriotism and why one should speak up against criminals for the good of the united states picture that in today's films br br a district attorney walter huston almost begging for death penalty sentences and the populace shown as supporting it 100 percent once again picture that in modern day movies br br along the way you have some shocking violence such as a young boy being picked up a few times and literally thrown head first into a closet and his father being picked up and swung repeatedly head first into a wall this is a tough stuff to say the least br br yet the film is dotted with comedy mostly by the patriotic grandpa memorably played by charles chic sales there are a bunch of laughs for all those who view this unique crime film and for soft touches there are the two young boys one of whom dickie moore went on to become a pretty famous child actor in his day here he is just a little tyke of about 5 years of age who understandably is far from being a polished actor but you can see stardom for him on the horizon in fact he did just that the following year with a solid performance in blonde venus starring marlene dietrich br br anyway this is an entertaining film because of an effective mixture of violence comedy and sentimentality and it has a nice feel good ending and a thought provoking message it was up for an academy award too for best writing original story i am sorry to say it is only available for viewing on cable tv as it has never been put out on vhs or dvd and that's a shame,1
3032,i need help identifying an episode of king of queens it begins with a scene where doug is talking to carrie on the phone and he suggests that they agree to stop ending every conversation with i love you however it's hard to do and he ends up calling her back only to close with i love you it's a very clever moment and one i think says a lot about relationships that have lasted a long time br br i think but i'm sure that's it's the same episode where doug gets some local construction guys to whistle and throw lurid comments at carrie to perk her spirits up br br i saw this episode recently but it was probably a repeat don't know what network i saw it on can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode,1
3033,the '80's were the best of times and worst of times for james karin he starred in one of the best cult horror comedies with return of the living dead and a year later he acts in this piece of this bad movie a sequel to but not really has a group of fairly unlikeable characters attempting to make a movie in greece through design or sheer laziness the line between the film and the 'film within a film' is not only blurred but throughly non existent from scene to scene which would be confusing if i were just interested in anything happening in the movie in the first place unfunny would be too generous a term br br eye candy nana and many numerous extras get topless brenda bakke shows some t a br br my grade f br br dvd extras just trailers for american high school strike virgin territory comes in a double feature dvd with the first film for the masochistic,0
3034,curse of monkey island is a treasure in my opinion the series as a whole was the holy grail of adventure gaming not to mention br br but to return to curse whats beautiful about is that its not afraid to be itself it does deviate from the first two but still remains faithful to the ron gilbert productions if only the same could be said about the 4th installment of the series the voice work is impeccable with dominic playing our favorite protagonist the animation while quite different than the classic pixelated characters is done beautifully it really is just absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic its never annoying and you never have the urge to turn it off br br although i'm not too big a fan of romance the romantic scenes and themes are not at all overpowering they also have the rare ability to come off as sweet instead of cheesy that says a lot from a girl who routinely falls asleep during chick flicks br br then of course is the classic mi element of humor is quite adept at delivering deadpan lines altogether absurdist humor and simply good fun gary coleman makes a cameo as a budding young entrepreneur and world events are discreetly jabbed at without stepping out of the bounds of the game br br its not entirely fair to compare to mi and because it truly is in a realm of its own personally i can never find a favorite between the 3 as they all are quite different from each other however if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flair of the classic series i insist you give this game a shot you will not be disappointed br br 10 10 stars hands down br br emily n,1
3035,i being a fan of rupert rented this film a few months ago i thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors it was entertaining and showed that rupert could play more than his most well known character of ron his subtle portrayal of ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable br br ben a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job he finds one and becomes the i guess you could call assistant to a retired actress at first it is just a way for him to earn some money but after a while he and seem to develop a friendship helps ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself and in the end they both seem to need each other br br whether you are a fan of rupert or not this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments i highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors,1
3036,i'm seeing a pattern here if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000 chances are if you go to imdb com there will be hordes of lovers of the film yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was sooo bad i'm sorry but i read a lot about x m as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism well if that is the case i could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed gravity might be the first obvious observation or as mst3k did as a skit selective gravity also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type just compare this to when worlds collide which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks there's no comparison the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own its not even funny to watch on its own it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of just bad bad bad oh did i mention it's bad,0
3037,hell to pay bills itself as the rebirth of the classic western it succeeds as a western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby boomers experienced decades ago the good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad bo svenson stella stevens lee majors andrew excellent in this film tim thomerson and james drury are all great and it's fun to see them again james drury really shines in this one maybe even better than his days as the in a way hell to pay reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance if you're of a certain age buck taylor peter brown and denny miller and william smith provide a wow factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days hell to pay features screen legends along with newer names in hollywood most notable in the cast of newbies is rachel who i've seen lately on the young and the restless and kevin who plays the angst ridden kirby a war weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to do the right thing william gregory lee is excellent as chance mischievous and womanizing brother katie keane plays rachel sister a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process in a small but memorable role jeff davis plays mean joe a former confederate with a rather nasty mean streak i think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future hell to pay is a fun movie with a great story to grab the popcorn we're west,1
3038,there is one adjective that describes everything about this film acting plot effects continuity etc and that word is poor the government wants to asses the effects of space travel on certain organisms but the capsule crashes and a mutant something or other looks like a guy in an ape suit with the top of a football helmet over his face wreaks havoc around the accident scene which includes a favorite place for the window fogging partying set therefore some young people as well as a law enforcement officer are among the creature's victims you gotta be extremely about how you spend your time or rich if you spend any money to view this epic,0
3039,the one is a very aptly name show mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching br br when i first heard of the one i thought to myself another sing song show we don't have enough of those and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners because in all honesty the constant year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isn't enough we needed another one and not just any one the one the one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent the one with slightly less of a point though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible the one with pointless footage of the contestants when they're not performing included because i care what johnny sings a lot does in his off hours i really do now you may be thinking hey on the entire continent of north america less than 4 million people watched the first episode doesn't that mean this show sucks well to that i say less than 4 million people in north america have syphilis so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they think about it br br in the end the one may be horribly unoriginal a show that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is but it's still not syphilis yay,0
3040,madonna gets into action again and she fails again who's that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of shangai surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not suspecting that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people don't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth madonna failed as an actress 'cause the script was quite weak not so bad especially for those who like the 80's it's such a ramshackle trash colorful and joyful action movie at the end it's very funny to watch it,1
3041,i loved this film markie post is really great in it i saw it on lifetime and it's in the same entertaining class as films like 'the betty broderick story' up a mother's rage' etc which by the way are also very good entertaining films it's an over the top drama about a single mother who tries to break away from her middle class predictable personality this movie is just pure entertainment it doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction but it does show how any regular middle class person can they do get addicted to heroin junkies aren't just homeless uneducated people on the street by the way if you do watch it check out how the kid bosses his mother around spoiled 8 out of 10 stars,1
3042,on its surface this is one of the most classically entertaining action comedy romance films i've seen in a long time reminding me of pleasurable old saturday afternoon movies that had just the right balance of unexpected twists well timed humor and integrated action beyond this though there is our knowledge of this film's context it has the same elements of casablanca but is set just before many of the characters would truly understand the seriousness of what was happening to their country and the world and the consequences of some of their own behavior this adds a strong note of irony to the humor we sense that one of the female characters has a radical change of hairstyle in her future this is a film that you will not regret watching,1
3043,bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady mari who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film who controls the local syndicate our hero let's call him not paul from the diamond center plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of the simpsons' luigi you da spaghetti and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food no there's no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce there's a red buddha in the pasta the calling card of the murderous crime boss who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims death machines is bad by any measure and pretty boring which is an even worse crime,0
3044,blind date columbia pictures 1934 was a decent film but i have a few issues with this film first of all i don't fault the actors in this film at all but more or less i have a problem with the script also i understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality but the script made ann character look weak she kept going back and forth between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time paul kelly's character although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty ann sothern as opposed to neil hamilton while he did like her a lot i didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character the production values were great but the script could have used a little work,0
3045,so far only the first episode has been shown and a great fuss has been made about the lesbian sex scenes but for those who bother to look past that they will find an incredibly beautiful love story and one that has in this episode ended in an upsetting climax cliffhanger i have found the story so powerful that i have been inspired to read the novel on which this fantastic series has been based,1
3046,i must admit at first i was worried about farscape the opening segment was not very strong and i began to worry about what was to come however once it set in to familiar henson territory with the wry sense of humor the unique and enduring characters and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction the story follows john crichton played by ben browder a scientist who has developed a spaceship and theory that rely on slingshot propulsion however during the first test his craft encounters an unknown magnetic field and he is propelled into an unknown galaxy where he finds himself in the middle of a struggle between escaping prisoners on the starship and the peacekeepers human enforcers he is quite literally drawn into the prisoners ship and after many twists and turns finds himself united with the prisoners ka a warrior a priestess xvi a deposed ruler and sun a who has reluctantly joined the crew with excellent special effects moderate make up and puppets and robots that exceed the henson standard of perfection as well as a very well written story and character driven plot farscape looks to be a fantastically original creative and clever science fiction series,1
3047,what bird is that a maltese falcon the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael hair which has more depth and character than the man underneath it br br the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue salutes to raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and crime fiction etc seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or the reason this film has no and near forgotten is it's so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers this film is what the title suggests,0
3048,first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not a werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about a that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isn't any good actually it's bloody awful but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it it's a low budget horror movie with a monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie is really br br this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo she's the worst of them all i have never seen an actor as bad as her and i've seen even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it i hate her br br some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but that's the way i like it the looks pretty messed up and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit br br overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer,0
3049,the four la cops in fedoras driving around in a big black convertible look faintly absurd and even more ridiculous when it turns out that nick nolte the dumbest looking of the lot is in charge the writer never manages to create a spirit of camaraderie among the squad members and the director fails to wring out of the man mountain nolte questioning anyone nolte's character lights a gets mad and beats interviewees to a pulp his methods get him nowhere until at one point in the action he is wandering from tossed residence to tossed residence with his mouth open and his brain shut he smashes up an fbi squad and throws two military officers out of a plane in flight with only a vague report of anger at hq and no punishment at all at the end of the film he is as gormless and muscle bound as he was at the outset how he managed to get a beautiful whore to fall deeply in love with him is a mystery as is the eternal devotion and tragic sense of betrayal expressed by his jobless wife two interesting shots in the picture one of an atomic explosion the other of a gigantic crater ostensibly caused by a bomb it's almost as wrecked and puffy as nolte's face,0
3050,notorious hk catiii actor anthony wong is for once well not actually once he was a cop in the daughter of darkness films and a few others not a psychopathic weirdo in erotic nightmare usually recognized for his role as a complete in such catiii nasties like the untold story and the ebola syndrome this time wong is on the receiving end of the nastiness br br wong plays a guy who goes to a sorcerer who promises to give him really good dreams for a price true to his word the dreams that wong has involve having mad donkey sex with smokin' hot schoolgirls but the dreams come with a price that's more than money the sorcerer can manipulate the dreams and with the help of a sexy ghost blackmails wong out of his cash and business kills his family and eventually kills wong himself wong's brother comes to town to find out what's going on and eventually finds that his family's murder is the work of the evil sorcerer but as it turns out wong's brother is a pretty dope ass sorcerer himself and with the help of the sorcerer's abused wife turns the tables on the sorcerer and his schemes br br erotic nightmare is one of the more enjoyable catiii films i've seen in a while absent is the gritty and dark feel of some of the other catiii entries like red to kill the untold story or human pork chop erotic nightmare though still sleazy in terms of sex and subject matter is more fun then some of the more serious films of the genre more comparable to eternal evil of asia a more carefree catiii entry that delivers plenty in terms of nudity and a good bit of gore without being overly comedic either definitely worth a look especially to the genre enthusiast 8 10,1
3051,who'd a thought suicide could be dealt with in a way that's palpable by everyone i saw the film at sxsw at it's premier and it turned out to be the best film there by far yes its warped and it's bizarre but it makes sense in the world the filmmaker michael creates if you didn't laugh most everyone did then you just ain't getting it and thats a darn shame particularly of note guillermo diaz as hector steals a bunch of scenes and the chemistry between natasha and david is intense the film reminds one of harold and maude but not really it takes one bizarre spin after another and they do all make sense in this crazy mixed up world we all live in i stayed as did most for the q a afterward and what was great was hearing that the same things i thought in my head as to why things happened are the reasons they did i don't think you can say much bad about the film unless you didn't get it i think i got it and it seemed like most everyone else did as well the film is dubbed a suicidal comedy but its got a lot of heart a lot of laughs and offers a lot of hope yet it doesn't shy away from the horrors of suicide as well a nice little movie that should get attention when it gets a release which will hopefully happen sooner rather than later,1
3052,i've seen a fair few films from the far east recently some were excellent battle royale infernal affairs the eye and some were not so great versus the triple cross then there are ones like and which while flawed i still enjoyed br br the basic premise involves the mysterious and horrific effects that a growing obsession with spirals has upon a community sound silly yeah thats what i was thought firstly the good stuff direction was top notch sure a bit over the top in places but never the less interesting and stylish secondly the story was original and like other writers commented very lovelace esq it was interesting what it reminded me most of however was early cronenberg films like shivers and videodrome br br the acting wasn't great but not too horrible either to be honest i was actually bored on a few i felt the pacing especially initially was a little slow my main problem was that it was too silly and funny to be true horror and yet not so enough to be considered a comedy spoilers below br br spoilers some good scenes washing machine and i liked the final shot voiceover at first i thought it ended far too abruptly but about 20 seconds later i realised the meaning and liked the end however because of the lack of seriousness in the story combined with over the top scenes such as the news report at the school ment that i did not care for the characters much in the end the final scene which was perhaps supposed to be a little while in reality i couldn't really care for the girl or her boyfriend spoilers end br br so overall i kinda did like this film but it frustrated me and i think there was real potential in addition to some good scenes couple of other points the main girl is quite pretty and cute and the song that plays at the end is good too i rated it 7 10 br br,1
3053,this movie is trash because out of many reasons it is based on mark book which is also trash let me must say that mark is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight and others that right this type of trash belong in jail for the movie itself being based on the book was horrible as well the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related thru his aunts marriage to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession this poor guy and his family have been hounded by the police for years they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it besides the facts that the statute of limitations among other things should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god don't watch this garbage,0

3055,those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point this is a wonderfully camp romance with plenty of play gypsies dance gypsies music that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them up ray milland makes an amusing foil for a dietrich with black hair tattered scarves and tons of jewelry the character's eagerness to feed milland and look after him more closely resembles the good german dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles censorship being in force it's made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only with milland fighting off dietrich's advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day his only excuse is that she smells so perhaps a stuffy fastidious englishman might indeed be put off br br in the small role of milland's young companion on his secret mission bruce lester adds a note of camp of a different kind we are told at the beginning that he hero worships milland and indeed he rather on him when after they are separated he meets milland now transformed into a brown skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only dietrich is romantically infatuated with milland br br despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events the growing love of milland for dietrich and his acceptance of the non rational aspects of life is rather touching and when on their last night alone before he escapes he says that each of them now contain half of the other the two have become one and then darkness falls i think we can assume that the censor decided to give them a break one goof at the beginning milland who is supposed to be english refers to a lieutenant using the american pronunciation the english say since milland was british he must have been saying it that way because the american movie makers feared that american audiences would be distracted and confused by the british style,1
3056,made with film stock left over from the production of nana 1927's sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned and that's the best way to view it jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes  in a black explorer travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston naturally he assumes she's a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of 'white music there are plenty of surreal touches be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hair the angels the girl telephones renoir and producer pierre among them or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion but there's not really enough to sustain it for two reels an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions new dvd,0
3057,a new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat lake bell is wonderful it is to bad that her other show miss match was canceled i am just glad she came back on surface i can't wait for the return of surface this show is really something unique to watch with an eerie underwater world that is akin to jurassic park this show keeps you wondering what is next is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous there are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects when something like surface comes along you just have to say thank you,1
3058,the only reason to see this film is sung hi lee the stunning model actress from korea who plays miki give me a break in this otherwise crappy movie br br she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well though none of the parts is really interesting or well written even for a national lampoon's movie it's really stupid stupid humor is one thing but just stupid is another i may have laughed once and that was probably just me being polite br br warning watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts 1 it like totally sucks 2 sung hi lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight br br so don't say i didn't warn you,0
3059,surprisingly good mean streets type crime drama foreshadows elements of goodfellas and casino joe pesci's first big role clever dialog i think the maltin guide gives this a bomb rating i can only guess no one actually bothered to watch it br br saw this at tarantino's film fest and he said scorsese used a number of these actors in raging bull,1
3060,talkshow with spike is one of those shows that will definitely audiences either you like it or you don't personally i find most of the bits hilarious but it does have some huh moments br br staples like idiot paparazzi are always good for a laugh but my all time favorite bit has to be the one off hollywood douchebag comedy for stoners is the only regular bit that generally leaves me confused which is part of the point spike and his team of writers manage to churn out loads of fresh comedy time after time so the show never feels stale brand of humor may not be for everyone but it's definitely worth trying br br the masses have spoken we like this show and want more please note i am not a friend of or affiliated in any way with spike talkshow with spike staff or fox network and it's just plain funny,1
3061,the quickie 1 outta 5 stars br br pretty poor movie an old as the hills story about a high ranking gangster who wants to quit passing on his empire to his inept son of course it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit so a contract is put out on his life after throwing a big party an exterminator jennifer jason leigh who i guess is never going to act in anything other than tv movies or low budget direct to video trash ever again is called to the scene our hero makes a pass at her offering her big money for a quickie she turns down his offer even though she needs the money but winds up staying overnight anyway even after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks she was sent to kill his father ugh the story just goes on and on you can see every twist and turn coming a mile away weird soundtrack by some group called the tiger lillies will drive most people nuts but i thought there was one kind of cool track towards the end or maybe i was just excited because i could tell that the movie was almost over jennifer jennifer jennifer what the hell happened to you,0

3063,we saw la last night the chicago international film festival we were both immensely moved by it this is a haunting tale of loneliness missed connection in which the longing for intimacy conflicts with our fear of revealing too much about ourselves to another the three leads as valeria brigitte as flavia andrea as massimo are all excellent and the dynamic between them is very surprising br br after all the movies which older women it's wonderful to see flavia who is a law professor at a university in rome presented as beautiful sensual as well as seductive powerful we're conditioned to believe that when a younger woman enters 'the mix ' the older woman will become jealous of the younger woman the man will leave the older woman for the younger woman etc etc in this film however emotional truth is considerably more complex highly recommended,1
3064,a lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul some a handful others maybe a couple br br then there's linda blair the exorcist that's it br br when you see chained heat and watch linda blair in it you have to wonder what if anything was running through her mind br br certainly not oh boy oscar for best actress here i come br br just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s this one actually has names you may recognize john vernon plays the dean i mean the warden with a hot tub in his office wonder what he told the contractor stella stevens pops up even henry silva and louisa moritz show how bad they needed the work br br and special mention of course for our heroine sybil danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor blair to paraphrase sybil is as sybil does and everything sybil does is done perfect makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching br br almost br br two stars one for sybil and another for trying to pass off linda blair as a sex symbol whatever could have possessed them get it,0
3065,have you ever watched a film when after it's conclusion your left pondering what in the world it was all about well say hello to scream baby scream it's not that the story's complex or anything like that it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes 1 a fun 60s drug movie 2 a much overplayed soap opera and 3 a horror flick with very little to scream about much to my surprise i've found out that it was written by one of my all time favorites larry cohen well i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error br br playing out much like something from h g lewis only with lesser fx this bad film does have it's perks for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard and there are a couple of memorable scenes one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded but amusing trust me when i tell you there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one,0
3066,i loved this movie when i was a teenager loved it it hasn't grown up with me though maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish full of macho posturing cheesy dialogue overwrought slo mo and characters saying a lot the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another one plot strand to another without ever bringing it all together and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching but no one's really at the top of their game here and the women folk get particularly short thrift the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences and hans zimmer's majestic score which remains one of my all time favourites,0
3067,what a strange atmosphere is being created in the streets and on the golden gate bridge of san francisco in this exciting action picture although the characters and the story are in fact bad it still has a certain cult flair,1
3068,from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence showing moses as a murderer people who actually believe in the old testament will just sit there and shake their heads i am not a religious person at all but even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against god and the jews when moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery i wanted to stone the writers i can't believe in this day and age that hallmark and abc disney would attempt to show such garbage as this don't we have enough problems in this world already,0
3069,the worst film ever made bar none give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it except for the bit where the hard luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should that's all,0
3070,this bright hilarious english comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem the significant question is where is the audience the film is rated 10 by most voters but how many voters is that they don't make comedies like this anymore because the films don't get distributed or seen i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again but where are the art houses,1
3071,like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm in fact so fond are said cherished memories that i recently purchased the dvd box set in order to revisit that happy and carefree period of childhood whereby i used to sit utterly mesmerised as i watched the ongoing quest of monkey sandy and later yu lung a horse dragon man you'll really need to watch it to understand when the much loved show initially aired on bbc 2 on friday evenings as i recall br br well i'm pleased to say that even after all these years and now viewing this with adult i e more cynical eyes the show has lost none of its inimitable charm br br simply wonderful entertainment from the magical characters and their comical interactions with one another to the perhaps not so special effects which actually serve to heighten the fun and of course not forgetting the hugely memorable opening title sequence from the first season the passing of time has not in any way shape or form diminished any of monkey's spellbinding charm br br as monkey himself would probably say you there go out and grab yourself some nostalgic fun ',1
3072,this is one of my most favorite movies of all time pretty pathetic you say well yeah it is but chris is incredibly incredibly funny his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films look at both motel scenes when spade gets caught with his zipper down and the other just go away for the love of god,1
3073,wagon master is a very unique film amongst john ford's work mainly because it's the only one that is based on a story written by john ford himself the story that was elaborated by frank nugent and director's son  patrick ford and turned into a screenplay and because of director's personal opinion regarding it wagon master is the film john ford called the one which came closest to being what i had wanted to to say so is not to say a little but as ford confessed once to lindsay anderson his favourite was nonetheless my darling clementine and not any other br br wagon master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a john ford's film wonderful cast delivering his best thou not featuring any major stars except the most of all actors  ben johnson very peculiar small characters who provide an obligatory comic relief and wagon master has quite a few of them such as horn blowing sister jane darwell in her shot but very inspired gigs and last but not least legendary monument valley with john ford's fifth passage through it after stagecoach my darling clementine fort apache and she wore a yellow ribbon br br the film starts with two friends cowboys travis blue ben johnson and sandy owens harry carey jr being hired to be wagon masters or guides for a caravan of mormon settlers who are headed to silver valley a place that's for them like a promised land on their way they are joined by a very peculiar dr hall alan mowbray with two beautiful women who are supposedly his wife and daughter and who call themselves actors they are headed in the same direction simply because they were recently driven out of the nearest town and have no other place to go nothing particularly unpleasant happens till they bump into a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who are on the run from the marshal of the town where they recently committed murder and bank robbery br br overall wagon master is no more nor less than one more precious pearl in a necklace of john ford's wonderful westerns a must see 9 10 br br,1
3074,is this a good movie it's hard to say but in 1953 for many people it was a remarkably effective movie suspenseful scary and then amazingly actually touching when the old gentleman meets his unhappy death at the end of the movie br br yes what lurks in the maze turns out to be something of a surprise and for a lot of people a hilarious one but the basic idea recapitulates was a very real one at the time the book was written and does have some basis in fact not that it would ever result in what we see in the movie of course br br but working on what must have been a very low budget one of the greatest production designers and the person for whom the term production designer was invented creates a very eerie mood that was strangely compelling at times of course the movie is very silly but it has its moments,1
3075,a nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by doctor stephens she is upset to learn that the doctor has died leaving his assistant doctor masters in charge she is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy judge a shell shocked vietnam vet a catatonic and a creepy nympho but is soon befriended by a hulking black man sam she needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around her don't look in the basement is my first horror film of s f despite its low budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk through an eyeball the climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera work gore and piercing screams 8 out of 10,1
3076,i just got back from the film festival at the amc loews 34th in ny a friend told me about this film audience response was very positive lots of good solid laughs as well as some quiet moments of realization top notch in every area a movie that makes you think and then makes you realize how lucky we'd all be if we could turn back time and live without shame or guilt i imagine this will come close to if not win the audience favorite award what was most surprising was the fact the the movie appears to start off as a satire and then slowly weaves into a genuine commentary on the negative and sometimes violent reactions of the very group it started to satirize there isn't any mean spirited humor at the expense of one group just a slow realization that we would all be better off if we just went back to the gentle innocence that we all started off with,1
3077,i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through i am amazed that this film currently has a 7 5 star rating the acting is awful script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow for a funny film i cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly,0
3078,surely the gershwin family realizes this is one of america's greatest opera you have thousands of fans of this opera waiting for it to be released on dvd please don't be so stubborn give us a break think of the joy and wonder you can bring to a starved public for quality music by releasing this great gem don't wait until the film is beyond repair the cast is first rate the music is just awesome we need beautiful music in today's world it may never be filmed again with such a great cast again with today's home theater systems wonderful sound systems and need for great music i'm pleading with the gershwin family to reconsider and release this awesome movie thanks so much,1
3079,the story of tom garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend henry henry and his wife debate whether tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel the film is beautifully written acted and directed and i highly recommend it br br tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad dominating his board of directors and his competition terrorizing his employees slaughtering tom's ambitious wife sally was responsible for all of tom's success when he met her he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a for the railroad sally teaches him to read and takes over his job while tom goes to school he starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president br br but as tom becomes a business tycoon his marriage to sally gradually falls to pieces his spoiled son despises him and he takes up with a much younger woman the aptly named eve with predictably catastrophic consequences in his business life tom is a total success in his personal life a disastrous failure much like the hearst figure in citizen kane tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system br br spencer tracy is terrific in the role of tom garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity colleen moore is also excellent as sally both of them age beautifully in the multi generational story the film was written by preston sturges but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which sturges became famous,1
3080,oh my god this is so idiotic completely pointless offensive and repulsive why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting zoey and chase together we all want them too in normal shows there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show wow what a concept also you cant even tell the zoey 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is giggly and stupid zoey is just kinda there chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing nicole is giggly and stupid zoey is just kinda there chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice and logan is a jerk repeat it's like a shampoo bottle and the end of the movie omg again so pointless nothing happens it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot,0
3081,i caught this show a few times when i was young and it was playing tilt my parents loved it and now in syndication i feel what they feel this show did what the original limits and twilight zone new and old couldn't do this show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas br br i still cannot believe jonathan and brad wright did this those guys were producers on stargate sg 1 the show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere this is what was not there in the new twilight zone rod serling coming in added to the scariness forest coming in lightened the mood br br the ending whether good or bad made for a scary time you could never predict what was going to happen i am still trying to find the seasons on dvd,1
3082,while i can understand some of the points made regarding the cinematography i thought a more purposeful approach would have better supported the low fi home movie feel i must say that i thought the script and acting of what alice found were excellent dean bell has crafted a real gem that judith charms with character driven delight her performance of sandra is a pleasure unfolding alternately as diabolical and romantic we are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions and never given more information than is necessary her's and the supporting cast's efforts meet bell's post modern fairy tale with arms wide open emily grace's alice is infused with a eyed magic she seems to mold like clay before us morphing into some sort of beautiful lost beast by the end we are at odds with words as she is saying goodbye to her mother kudos also should be doled out to jane lincoln taylor whose mother provides the right amount of tragic historic weight and justin parkinson whose shy first time john sam provides one of the sweetest if not most awkward sex scenes in film bell has created a first rate story and assembled a plethora of talent to make it,1
3083,the curse of monkey island released excactly 6 years after the success of monkey island 2 you would think with monkey island 2's wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all but it all turned out to be a trick to lure into captivity but enough about that the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned and the voices are just phenominal if were to make a movie cartoon of monkey island this would probably be what it would look like and sound like it's plot is real good and everything about it is just awesome if you haven't heard about the monkey island series buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island then monkey island 2 and the curse of monkey island monkey island 4 was real good but this one tops them all,1
3084,my impression having seen this documentary is that nathaniel kahn ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film br br he took five years to make it a labour of love and longing i can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process what to leave in what to take out br br his father the renowned architect louis kahn comes across as a man too selfish and self absorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three but like many men of his character he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity br br one of his mistresses said he was accessible but that is never explored other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate a pity br br the tension between the three half siblings in the room of a home louis designed is also palpable the unsaid hovers over the conversation the only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind some great some not so great br br i was captivated by the music ship and the salk institute saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy not again br br 8 out of 10 beautifully filmed genuine br br it appears in this case at least the son is not the father of the man,1
3085,this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen what were they thinking stop preaching to me already this is why all of us watch walker texas ranger and wont admit it to our friends terrible acting and a extremely phony plot while the movie is unfolding the story stops and the actors start preaching to the audience the director somehow believed the two meshed well it looked like crap when i saw the title at my local blockbusters it looked interesting their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action adventure first time in a long time i stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate finishing it,0
3086,if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina portrays a mute adds to her and increases the suspense alec guiness's appearance was nice but didn't really add to the movie i'm not sure if evan richard's part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment,1
3087,just caught the rain people on turner classic movies late one night the film was released in 1969 shirley knight stars as natalie a long island housewife who exact reasons unknown leaves her husband and embarks on a road trip not knowing exactly where she is going natalie is also newly pregnant which complicates things along the way she picks up a brain damaged ex football player jimmy james caan who has been kicked out of his college and is hitchhiking there are many twists and turns along the way between these two as natalie struggles to take care of jimmy and she begins to realize he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself she is going through her own struggles needless to say and in no position to care for him natalie appears to be a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown at times she makes some odd phone calls to her husband who begs her to come home natalie tries to dump jimmy several times only to have him re enter her life through circumstances a young robert duvall plays a strange and troubled cop who befriends natalie you get the sense all along that this film is going to end badly and it does this film is certainly uneven at times and the script is somewhat lacking francis ford coppola directed this and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the next few years for directing the godfather the actors are good ones needless to say as they all would have futures ahead of them in film shirley knight is the least known of the three although she is also underrated as an actor james caan is especially effective here and he seems to just inhabit this character this film remains little more than a curiosity now no doubt because it is an early movie of coppola's and i confess i had never heard of it so god bless turner classic movies for bringing it to a new audience,0
3088,nicole finn madonna is just being released from prison although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested this is because she claims she has information that would clear her record griffin dunne is assigned to escort her to the bus by his future father in law will be driving around the city anyway in his future mother in law's rolls royce picking up the wedding ring and a rare big big cat for an eccentric collector nicki however starts the ensuing mayhem as soon as she jumps in the rolls to take over the driving between big cats taxi drivers hit men and a wedding cake with guns lawyer knows he's not in kansas anymore is there a way out of the madness this film is a wild trip down comedy avenue madonna and perfect foils to each other making their connection uproarious as they play out their roles as an ex con and an uptight button down lawyer respectively the script is laudable in it's ability to send the viewer into fits of hysteria as one implausible scene gives way to the next one and the next everything secondary from the supporting actors to the scenery to the costumes are also quite nice if you know someone who is in need of a jolt of joy rent this movie for them you will both be pronto,1

3090,here in germany it was only shown on tv one time today as everything becomes mainstream it's absolute impossible to watch a film like this again on the screen maybe it's the same in usa or especially gb the message is a brutal truth find friends to make your ideas come a bit closer to reality or you become a loser if not an asshole instead br br the whole film is not particularly as simple as it may seem here every little scene every sentence every behavior of the characters show a sharp look at what could happen when one person is not accepted in a sadistic crowd which calls itself normal br br very well played by all this is a must seen who is the main character john not cox folks remember ore niles who still is bimbo decide and you will get the plot as it is intended br br a bitter look at what society becomes in a repressive system kind of catcher in the rye and lord of the flies thought to the very end br br the final maybe change your own mind word,1
3091,despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons loud fat dad mum 3 children a pet typical suburban home family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons its avid use and sometimes too much of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season while some hit the nail on the head the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season 5 is spine hilarious others are less successful coming across as contrived and they can be annoying especially when they don't advance the story line the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting br br the chemistry between and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family br br however the feature film griffin the untold story is horrible thank goodness it went straight to dvd br br contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons seth approach with family guy is actually very different it's much more politically incorrect and amazingly a lot more brazen br br creator of ren and stimpy john famously criticized family guy for having extremely low graphic standards from a standpoint i don't think it looks that bad though the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful br br all in all a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes,1
3092,the argentinian music poet once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music br br this film as i feel it is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country's history first a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it then some believe that they hear it but they don't then nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it and others recognize that they have heard it but didn't think that others might be hearing it finally everybody listen to the same music and suddenly it doesn't sound any more br br love and poetry as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children br br why would he call the film the dead when nobody dies the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners following james joyce's title br br a nice 1900 irish filmed postcard,1
3093,reading the other two comments i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie br br perhaps life is drastically different in australia but wow call it sci fi or fantasy but people just don't act like this br br i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself it gets better after the first half hour but i doubt most could make it that far br br yikes,0
3094,this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i've seen in full the first was rope which i really enjoyed with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas rope took place all in one room i didn't enjoy this one as much as rope but that's not saying this is a bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more br br it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones as a thriller i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside br br the film doesn't feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving br br the performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat br br in the end i wanted more from this one i understand it's one of hitchcock's least exciting films but i did have a good time watching it i can recommend it just not enthusiastically,1
3095,there are two things that i noticed in this film this is not a spoiler just a mistake in storytelling when cole takes bill to his first b e he finds the box as soon as cole finds it he says the box everyone's got a box a minute later just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says we're actually very fortunate you don't see these often br br observation 2 spoiler alert br br i had to watch the thing three times i couldn't figure a couple of things out then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time br br that was a good thing because i don't know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix br br color me obsessive,1
3096,oh dear gods this is awful stay away just stay away if you think you've seen bad movies think again never before has my brain hurt as much as it did after i watched this movie the acting if it is allowed to be called that is enough to cause internal inside your head the story is so thin it is just barely there no wait scratch that there is not a complete story there but once in a while there is a few thin lines that stick up from all the amount of horribleness and believe me those few lines should have been shot the best way to enjoy this movie is to drop napalm on it and watch the cozy fire from a distance br br some may call me sarcastic in this review but i am only trying to spare some of you of a serious headache however should you be what i like to call a visual masochist like myself please go right ahead and watch this monstrosity,0
3097,due to rather dubious plate japan starts to slip under the sea initial predictions say it'll take about 40 years before the country is submerged but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year the government think he's a crackpot but evidence soon starts bearing his theory out br br this big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late 90's i assume having seen none of them with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human well japanese spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that i e it's as naive in its psychology as it's geology we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be useless br br the film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be it is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in self awareness as that hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads but she's not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hot br br the film is much too long at 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking i certainly didn't care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to the process should i ever find myself in that situation for real br br but it does have nice special effects and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot so i give it 3 10,0
3098,i totally loved this movie tried to buy it and can't find it a must see a movie you can watch again and again funny but also a tear jerker in one really good album for the movie it's a really good 80's movie i wish i could find a copy to buy this movie cause i would the actors in it acted really good there's a lot of people out there that probably could relate to this movie that's what makes this movie so good so go out and try to rent this one you won't regret it it's an older movie but it's worth watching i would not be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon but i'm sure it would not be the same anyone who hasn't seen it go rent it,1
3099,having lived in upper peninsula 30 miles from in the mid 1990s i was eager to see this film it begins promisingly enough with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u p life but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people instead he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical supernatural elements although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u s this is not it,0
3100,i was supremely disappointed with this one having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen well there was none this version played like a condensed dumbed down reader's digest movie not only did it feel rushed it was cheapened and needlessly re written major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen especially on what may very well have been a limited tv budget but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way i thoroughly recommend reading wilde's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty,0
3101,ah yet another seagal movie in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves as bad as submerged no but that is not saying much like perfume on a pig br br seagal is professional thief who wants to quit but goes for one last job only to be double crossed by his boss he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback br br its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent cop or what he usually plays we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems then an eastern european territory as usual there is no wire fu either here don does an okay job br br however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles scenes from other movies a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation seagal and make a so so team inspiring unintentional laughs one minute sighs the rest br br several notable faces turn up to slum it sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check no more rappers please at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up he should have gotten out a while ago,0
3102,this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie gee maybe that's why it is a straight to video wanna be movie br br i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it one of the worst decisions i have ever made what a waste i usually like b movies some of them are actually quite good but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny br br the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film these so called movie makers have absolutely no talent br br stupid plot horrible acting especially the drag queens what sicko would actually find that sexy lame writing if there even was a script seems like the kinda bull someone just made up on the spot br br what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well done at all br br how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results br br anyway avoid this stink bomb at all costs,0
3103,generally political messages are done on television so if you are a big fan of environmental correctness watch to your hearts content most people go to the movies to be entertained not sold some poppycock political nonsense the hook here is the big name cast unfortunately the sum of the performances equals a whole movie that went absolutely nowhere the two best performances chris cooper and richard dreyfus have minimal screen time in short silver city is to be avoided as entertainment it is nothing more than a non documentary rambling political expose on illegal immigration pollution and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere except on the small screen merk,0
3104,if you want to see how to ruin a film study this one very closely in fact it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes realism escapes this movie on every level the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script wannabe actors an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever with a formula like that it just had to be doomed br br i rented this once and i swear i got stupider watching it if you are a humanitarian buy this horrible horrible movie and burn it unwatched as a favor to the world it has no discernible plot bad acting and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape seriously the paint would be better i wish i could give this negative 10 stars,0
3105,i don't know what the critics were viewing when this movie was released but it slipped by them unnoticed it is well written witty satirical and thoroughly enjoyable it's like a video game brought to life you never know who's behind the door or what will happen next the violence is not gratuitous nor overdone for splatter effect br br one last word for you mickey rourke fans the is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end,1
3106,as a person god how i hate that phrase i just happened to catch this on cable where there was absolutely nothing else to watch overall it was a fantastic movie yes i was a little disappointed upon finding out that neither actor is disabled and yes i was a little disappointed that more of the movie wasn't filmed from the 'true' point of view of the disabled can you imagine what it's like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but other people's asses and crotches having to always wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only handicapped stall enduring everyone else's rude bodily while you wait and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me been there done that literally but the movie was true enough to matter while i've never lived in a home or assisted residence there were plenty of times throughout the movie where i found myself nodding and saying to myself yeah that's true that's happened to me what impressed me is that some of the commentors on this board expressed the fact that the movie made them view life a little differently and with a little more insight as the lives of a silent can't ask more than that out of a movie that it makes you think and view life differently so by virtue of that alone the movies was tremendously successful should be required viewing of every kid in junior high school br br pretty much for every person that's severely physically disabled independence is one of if not the most important focus of our daily lives from working to socializing to recreating for those of you who felt the movie was ' try living our life for a single day you'll see that the movie was because it's true the challenges the actors faced only skimmed the surface of what happens to us every day if we're lucky we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters including the girl did every day presents obstacles for us to overcome it's just that there's no swelling dramatic music to accompany our lives unless it's in our lol,1
3107,a great suspenseful thriller the acting is first rate and the plot keeps you guessing this well performed and directed movie is based on a true story and well worth while joe penny is cast extremely well and ann gillian is convincing as the and terrified sister joe again prove he's acting ability is amazing and the ending well done it s worth watching i hope they repeat it soon on any channel i will definitely record it for penny and gillian fans it's worth your time rent it if you can better still try to buy it i going to perfect early nineties thriller watch this br br movie it's great,1
3108,cinema at its best is entertainment if one is to question every aspect with which one finds room for disagreement and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions often biased then one should leave the cinema because their prejudices will always spoil their enjoyment when i spotted an airplane flying overhead in a film dated i was amused the background scenery in casablanca is absurdly fake so do i set up a moan say that the film failed to convince fiona relax and enjoy some excellent acting decision to cast the protagonists as french polish was inspired one was immediately aware of which side each of the main characters was representing no need to dwell on the authenticity of the wigs this is powerful cinema if there is a political message which is still relevant today have a dinner party a château with the gras a with the some polish vodka and perhaps a 1961 château rothschild with the beef and discuss the political aspects of until you drop with fatigue would surely have agreed,1
3109,it's strange while the film features full x rated sex scenes and violent murders it never feels as shocking as it ought to br br a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident upon their arrival a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women doesn't it always seem to work out that way br br among the acts we find a some lesbian encounters a three way with male prostitutes assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body even though it's all fully explicit it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex br br there is some blood and gore with the murders but given that this is a d'amato flick it's really tame for a much more rounded experience watch the similar nights of the living dead' br br 2 10,0
3110,i saw this last night and voted it an 8 since then it's grown on me and i'd give it a 9 br br the film has at first a seemingly slightly disconnected facade between the first and second halves the first half is a comedy and there's little hint of the ragged truths of eras life wars religious intolerance that will become revealed in the second half while at first it may be a little disconcerting because it's a slightly unfamiliar narrative sequence on reflection it works br br the acting was good in the role of alex the interpreter was especially great br br i've scanned most other user comments and see that some who've read the book are pleased with the movie while there are a few who are not both feelings of course are valid br br for me a retired family therapist and one world believer the film was relevant on two different levels br br the first as history gave a powerful reminder of how commonly happen with demonizing and trying to exterminate any of those with a different moral value system than our own br br the second was that in demonstrating the first it also revealed something in common to each of us all our families that each of us must go back to our roots to more fully understand ourselves br br t s eliot expressed this exquisitely in the 4th of his four when he said we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time br br jonathan goes on a fulfilling journey that any of us would find fantastically illuminating to explore and discover our roots what were those people going through then who were they really before when and during the early years before and after we were born etc br br so the film at first gives us the impression of a comedy then shifts to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies but through all that it also gives us subliminally a message about each of ourselves all of us would be abundantly rewarded to go back and understand the place from which we first started,1

3112,you have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when whistling in the dark opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s br br on top of some weak one liners and ordinary sight gags the plot is as far fetched as the tales the fox red skelton tells his radio audience you have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it but then that's how unrealistic the comedy is br br but if you're a true red skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the '40s you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him ann rutherford and virginia grey do nicely as his love interest and conrad veidt as always makes an interesting villain one of his more amusing moments is his reaction to skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans i never knew that he muses impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced br br all in all typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one liners has simply worn off,1
3113,good cinematography good acting good direction cannot justify a story that is not and cannot be acceptable to any society amitabh has often used the media to make this junk sell able by saying that if such an incident happens then what i would like to ask him if such a thing happens for your own child or your grandchild say girl child then what will you do i think every parents will have to take special care before interacting with any 60 year old neighbor if you have one jia with you such films should be banned and discouraged otherwise you inspire more more cases such acts are villainous and villains in films are punished that should be the moral of the story and not glorify their act or them,0
3114,while i score the movie a 7 i also should point out that it is both interesting historically as it stars mae marsh lillian gish and lionel barrymore when they were all younger and less well known and features pretty exciting action for its day br br the plot is odd for a western in that all the trouble with the indians begins for the weirdest reason i have ever seen the indians decide to have a giant dog banquet no they are not feeding dogs but feeding on dogs and when two indians arrive late there are not left so they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white settlement and this actually touches off an all out war not only is this silly but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences i don't know if american indians actually ate dog but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups all this over dogs the movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments such as when ms marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby exciting stuff but strange too,1
3115,portman and susan sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the women you will ever encounter sarandon has this ability call it talent if you will to play some of the most off beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes as the mother of this obviously brilliant and beyond her years young girl sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer more importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over portman's portrayal of the daughter the question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot who changes this film is certainly about the daughter but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter i am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also the hallmark of fine drama,1

3117,this movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went when i read the cover at blockbuster i thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie the movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions there was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay i thought it would be developed that in the movie it wasn't in the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads beside each one are two attractive women the men begin asking do you hear that or do you see them we conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating the women do not see these creatures this was fine for the first five minutes but this scene goes on for a full hour it is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film we are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be middle eastern terrorists what is this about we never find out the flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why at the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab but why what is the point we have no idea this film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down the makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline sorry but this movie was a waste of 4 and the time i spent driving to the rental store and then watching it take my advice don't rent it,0
3118,at least for me and rather unexpected as subject a movie that makes you question your beliefs your life your approach on everything that helps you see the world you we live in through a lens or a multitude of lens a moving surprising and haunting movie br br and it benefits of one of the best performances ever from kevin spacey very well by jeff bridges there isn't a false note in this tango it's a perfect dance perfect 'till the end br br what does the ending reveal well everything you want it to br br a movie one will want to see again maybe not right away maybe after a few days months years but it's something to go or come back to,1
3119,i remember hearing about this movie and how it played at nearly every drive in theatre here in toronto it's about a group of girls that are not accepted by the other sororities at their college so they start up their own and of course call it h o t s it's a fun movie that is just bursting with drive in nostalgia lots of fully endowed t shirts vans fighting and a football game showdown like no other it's been compared to animal house which is a good movie in it's own right but to me nothing compares to h o t s it has it's own brand of fun character if you are looking for a classic t movie look no further because the h o t s girls are to the rescue boom boom shorts all,1
3120,i never thought a movie could make me regret the fact that i subscribe to the hbo service now i know better jack is usually one of my favorite actors but not even he could rescue this part not that he tried jack plays his usual of type character unfortunately it doesn't transfer over to the american southwest he is about as believable a cowboy desperado as pee wee herman there is no edge to the performance and for that reason the comedy fails he is almost to goofy the remainder of the cast was worse timing in delivering lines is apparently something that the leading lady had not perfected as of 1978 and the others appeared to be just happy to be there my recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this movie is that you save your valuable time for something like watching paint dry,0
3121,the movie begins with much voice over a bad sign then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence insulting scenes involving and indians but it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow meanwhile the happy go lucky indians sit around watching them it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in blazing saddles there is a minor flaw in this comparison across the wide missouri is not a comedy br br,0
3122,i thought this was a very good movie someone said it was 'sick' so they couldn't watch it i think if you realize its rated r then you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use it is a good story and the acting is amazing just can't be a prude to appreciate it its basically about a mom who does drugs and wants to get clean so she calls a very wealthy old friend and he moves them to his estate and crazy things happen i guess it is a drama i am just so sick of people who don't like movies because of cursing or nudity that is the world we live in you obviously aren't comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie and it's rated r so that should tell you from the beginning that its not all peachy happy rainbows i liked it i think you will too,1
3123,one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor john carradine's more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich mindless scuffling brain dead only able to obey the most simple of orders bit like staff in mcdonalds br br hitler isn't mentioned by name since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for br br there seems to be two types of zombies in film the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black white films of the 1930's and '40's blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living dead' and 'the evil dead ' still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims both have their moments in various movies over the years br br features the former zombie type although these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair looks like a young don king br br as to the plot the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake even though he lets her keep her heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead she's not happy about it br br it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears and the moral of the tale must be never ever turn your wife into a zombie it's just asking for trouble br br the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish but never rises above it's poverty row origins not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same,0
3124,i originally watched this because i thought it was going to be the sequel to the league of extraordinary gentlemen and this movie is a whole different thing entirely going on here a comedy however i loved it anyways br br the league of gentlemen is apparently some british tv series with some rather odd characters and some sharp humour this is british comedy so it revolves around being very silly dressing up in costumes and making lots of fun of germans and french homosexual references in short it's very very funny br br the plot revolves around the writers of the tv show deciding to cancel some of the characters and the characters coming out of their dimension into the writer's dimension to stop that from happening it's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure i laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour this makes mr bean look like the watered down wimp he is rowan is much better in black adder series btw br br this is not monty python but you can never escape the comparison when you are talking british humour and there are a few similarities but not so many as to keep it from being it's own thing and being fresh it leans more towards the young ones and guest house paradiso in its' comedic style br br if you liked this check out the young ones series and guest house paradiso movie and of course i assume the tv series league of gentlemen must be rather funny as well,1

3133,this show has everything you could ever want from a prison drama there are twists and turns all the way till the season finally the characters are very strong and it gives the show a lot of power when watching the show you feel for not only the prisoners but the prison staff the actors who play prisoners on this show have done a very good job portraying a prisoner also if you like law and order svu or law and order criminal intent there are many actors from this show that appear in those shows the only problem with oz is that it was not long enough this show could of easily had nine to ten seasons without getting old even after the season finale i sill find myself watching oz all the time on dvd this show is easily one of the best shows on television don't be a fool go watch oz,1
3134,i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie which is a real pity because i like these folks i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this this was crap from every possible angle from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew br br i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact sleep well after it is released br br life what a trip,0

3137,what a surprise this film was i've seen a good few of fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director he also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed complex story line the dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like baby' br br the photography in this film is fantastic a strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered a scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema violence br br what went wrong lucio perhaps there is a strong case to suggest he had reached his peak with this film and it slowly went downhill after that,1

3139,the magnitude of the stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie in the battle of stalingrad more than one million people were killed in action froze to death or died of starvation russians romanians italians hungarians germans austrians of the 260 000 surrounded men of the sixth army 91 were taken prisoners of whom only 6 000 returned to their homeland years later br br what the story does not tell was that who surrendered did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men he had a special treatment as the highest ranking taken by the soviet army when during his presence at the nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the 91 000 prisoners he declared that they were fine he was freed after the war and died in the east germany br br the film only presents the first part of the tragedy the actual battle of stalingrad however for an entire picture the fate of the 91 000 should also not be forgotten,1
3140,at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final at least where i come from a bloke is trained by an ex cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood and that's about it lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people great job on the dubbing too guys best moment when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck he just gets out his gun and bang why not do that earlier it's a mystery as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place i'm still puzzling over that one myself now 2 10,0
3141,i have just recently seen heaven's gate after i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western i read the book by steven bach after considering all events and the movie itself i still think this movie is a complete waste of time i believe that when someone tells you to watch it they are in fact trying to bore you to death if for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie i have to ask why though this isn't a reason to hate it it is historically way off it pretends to be about a situation that happened in wyoming called the johnson county war simply the cattle of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all you find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then something would happen everybody in the movie talks about things that happen and it is never shown after you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens oh and by the way the johnson county war was not a war it never happened the johnson county war in fact was called that because it almost happened in actual fact 2 people died i can't warn you enough off this movie however if you're like me the the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put united artists on the for sale lot sounds like an interesting case to study then by all means watch this terrible movie with no sub text and a lot of photography which is lovely sometimes,0
3142,one of the funniest films i ever saw in the theater back in the early '70s and sadly it's only been on tv a few times since this movie should be released on video it's sellers at his sleaziest slimiest best as a crooked hospital administrator great cast great movie if anyone has a good vhs copy i'd love to buy it,1

3145,this is the worst of the toxie series by far the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original like there's a different girl friend of in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick why is this film made like a disney movie after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop after the films 20 minutes are up the film is entertainment h ll it's watchable well unless your drunk then don't watch this film you've been warned,0

3147,i just glanced over another comment posted here in which the writer discusses the disturbing ways the teenagers in this film use the body of their dead friend one overlooked in this statement is perhaps the most unsettling of them all no surprise it's what crispin glover's character does he is thrilled over one of his friends murdering another friend of his the killer's girlfriend not because did not like this individual rather he is excited about her death because it gives him something to do this poor boy is bored in life and dead inside that a murdered friend is something to get excited about because it provides him with something to focus on,1
3148,i hate a movie that doesn't have an ending i don't care how good or bad the rest might be i don't like to be left without a conclusion such shows should insist upon a disclaimer something like the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be conclusive br br in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says almost regretfully i thought that it couldn't be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child then it ends well sure the smoking gun so to say is in the hands of the dee's son but what about dominic's daughter i actually thought we might discover it was her anyway unless you like inconclusive movies then i'd avoid this one otherwise i thought the movie generally good,0
3149,there are many familiar hitchcock elements of previous and later films and this time they mix to a jolly but hardly suspenseful piece of entertainment you can tell that dorothy parker had a hand in the script the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of hero cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people the famous climax on the statue of liberty seems a bit heavy handed judged by standards but also compared to other hitch monument finals e g blackmail north by northwest,1
3150,i saw this film at the edinburgh film festival and would not recommend it it is two and a half hours long during which nothing much happens at a wading through porridge pace br br the main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality no one smiles at all during the film neither would i if i had their lives and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all br br the whole experience is depressing and ponderous the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique br br too many questions were left in my mind why does he sniff the algerian man's head why does he levitate what is he looking at over the fence why does he kiss joseph why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in rouge,0
3151,wonderfully funny awe inspiring feature on the pioneers of dj shadow and q bert are amazing in this terrific documentary check out just about every major dj crediting their getting in to scratch thanks to herbie hancock's post bop classic and archival footage of some of the most complex and mind blowing turntable routines of all time,1
3152,well the movie was no terrible but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born i suggest reading the book one of a kind the real unger story they left out huge parts of his life they also at times did not understand the real that he was the actual facts of his life were at times out of order and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have so please don't watch the movie read the book by the way i'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100 to the real story but they did not even come close,0
3153,i don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long br br i saw this film on tv i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably 10 minutes but that does not matter this film literally gripped me it is a real spine chiller br br the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tense even though there are many new faces their performances were top class br br the filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest the shock fear horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film br br the well written situations n twists fast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller this film actually switches between the genres horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock br br i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film,1
3154,symbolism galore great tunes this film crushed their soon to be no more target audience's expectations these monkees and the naturally selected members of the group were witnessing a subtle yet in your face kiss goodbye to each other the message rings true today the cage you escape from and the bridge you want to jump off of are the next generations own disappointments there will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains the film can be frustrating at times because the themes the film attacks are so blatantly apart of the american way of life a thinking and reasoning person cannot help but stare at their own reflection in the scenes of head and question not only their personal motives for continuing the madness of everyday american life but the motives of those who want it to continue for the sake of madness the final scene similar to don daring of the caged tiger to exit for battle represents just how delusional and impossible most dreams are,1
3155,my friends and i have often joked about movies being in real time but this movie really is they will literally show 4 minutes strait of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands it has no plot and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming i honestly don't believe that it won an award for it's alleged suspense if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for it's horrible acting accidentally hilarious one liners and all around low budget ness it won't matter this is so bad it's bad memories might even rub off and taint any good memories you have of the original you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen,0
3156,i had the good fortune to be at island in the fall of 1959 the di showed one evening at the outdoor theater directly in front of our barracks b co 1st 1st br br although we hadn't been there long enough to even think about seeing a movie we could hear those that were laughing it's one of the many indelible memories of my thirteen weeks at pi br br at some later date i got to actually see it in a theater i'm still convinced that to date it remains the most realistic portrayal of the experience in the late 1950's ever done no one has done it better than jack webb,1
3157,came across this film recently after so long hearing about it it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films not camp but humorous br br great cast from the magnificent carla and emma thompson to german superstar til schweiger this movie is a feast for the eyes alan rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time much like tracy and hepburn etc br br intelligent story nice twists and scope photography don't watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich br br sexy sexy sexy and very fun time br br best use of just like heaven by the cure ever must see to believe br br,1
3158,well you know rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors but wtf with this movie the story was lame and the script was just terrible the poor actors didn't have material to work with br br the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick you would expect something like top gun huge disappointment the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources not made for this movie and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models taking for granted the audience will not notice it br br as i said the story was lame with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting in short it seems a b movie made in the 70's br br i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here they sure must be ashamed,0
3159,those two main characters and stefan are a munich comedy act i was wondering if this is one of these typical slapstick movies where the story is either not important or simply not existing but when i saw this movie i was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it br br all in all very amusing and not a common german movie,1
3160,don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny it was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies i've ever seen ali g is only funny on channel 4's ali g show after watching his performance all i can say is he is not made for movies with a daft script or more like no storyline there's nothing to keep you entertained full of annoying unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way at the end of the film ali g gives a speech he mentions if you hated this film tell people it was good not even the speech could save the movie he probably knew its gonna be a stinker i would of given this a 0 10 but the minimum start is 1 overall don't even waste your time on this rubbish,0
3161,this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven the filming is supposed to be tele realistic but is simply sickening the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously the brechtian pauses for non existent advert brakes are tedious and even painful undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian it was just an accident which happened like that if you want to see a parody of reality tv watch celebrity deathmatch it's funnier and wittier and most importantly shorter i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film to be avoided like a rabid rabbit,0
3162,five years after the us civil war western folk are more concerned with the age old war between and cattle ranchers the cattlemen herd their wares from texas to the trail town of kansas there the cowboys find not only big money but also big confrontation with tall in the saddle marshal randolph scott as dan mitchell tries to keep peace in the town mr scott has experience between trail hands and saloon patrons he also juggles the town's finest looking women sexy saloon singer ann dvorak as rita and pretty church lady rhonda fleming as sherry boozy county sheriff edgar buchanan as bravo trimble offers more comic relief than sharp shooting assistance br br town begins with some promising symbolism and contrast gunshots interrupt scott and ms fleming singing a hymn in church then the camera switches to ms dvorak sexily singing her saloon number which causes a man to fire his gun in pleasure after that it really becomes quite a standard western it is somehow duller than it should be but not quite awful young lloyd bridges appears as one of the leggy costume is the film's greatest asset in it she is a real mover br br town 1 11 46 edwin l marin randolph scott ann dvorak edgar buchanan,0
3163,this film has a really weird mixture of genres toilet humour and action in one it doesn't really pull it off it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cute br br the most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting lodge motel i'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the proprietor of the hunting lodge charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno jacking off homosexual sex sex in a threesome charlie's photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carter's gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality horrified and titillated all at the same time which i don't find funny at all br br i have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one i've seen after this i'm not sure i want to see any more br br btw this is my husband's account he's seen happy gilmore and he tells me it's quite good maybe i should give sandler just one more chance br br countess,0
3164,it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946 but the movie is now a bit boring i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing and it was very predictable i mean we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end br br not worth watching it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career kane ambersons and a touch of evil,0
3165,when i first became a father about 5 5 years ago i was prepared for many of the sacrifices i'd have to make i knew i'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade but i wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night this in my humble opinion is cruel and unusual punishment br br underdog is bad it's not quite karate dog bad but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction if underdog were a television show i'd recommend flipping on by not even the presence of puddy and the voice of edwards can save it bow wow br br it was also just about the best 80 minutes i've ever enjoyed james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking flying mutt than watching the screen at 5 and 3 years old they were the target audience and this movie nailed the target there's a scene where underdog loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film when underdog was flying into outer space james was literally at the edge of his seat mesmerized the kids absolutely loved underdog and that's why i was there that's what last night was all about br br unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old i won't judge i had a blast,0
3166,it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me something similar happened with triplets of belleville but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate an exchange student from japan immediately started laughing at the movie saying that it sounded dumb now i don't agree that it is dumb the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time br br but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me it has an interesting message about and greed but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning especially because you already knew it anyway the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling and cherry pits for example are indeed repulsive br br there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the out of his scalp but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it br br as i said about triplets of belleville this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim or its japanese counterpart but an academy award nominated film it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from,0
3167,i saw this again today for the first time in about 6 years i had forgotten how well acted this movie is paul newman gets the billing but dwight schultz holds his own and shows how good an actor he really is,1
3168,i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years not consecutively of course i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11 and it was so atrocious i almost walked out i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended anyway it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up i can finally give it the rating it deserves br br 1 10 that was strangely satisfying,0
3169,this norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway apparently committing suicide but the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert he meets a man and is shipped off to a mysterious city where he starts working in an modern office as an accountant the coworkers seem nice if guarded he soon meets a girlfriend yet the city seems utterly strange as food has no taste alcohol doesn't make you drunk and there's nary a children around is this a dream or is he in paradise or in hell while at times the films looks as extended episode of the twilight zone even at ninety minutes the movie seems a bit long it is quite thought provoking the best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration and recoil at discussing deeper issues i always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature and this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style unfortunately the movie ends up a big long and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing,1
3170,todd sheets has created one of the greatest low budget zombie movies ever the story is great the gore is grand the psychos are wicked yet the movie is flawed by its petty dialogue and sluggish imaging at times br br despite this delivers what any zombie movie should gore good plot fast pace adventure into the if only mr sheets had been given a 100k budget this movie would out do every zombie movie ever even the almighty dawn of the dead br br but as time goes by he gets better and as he gets better more money comes into his pocket thus allowing this man this modern day genius to craft his vision better br br just remember that zombie bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he is atop of gore mountain,1
3171,this is the worst movie i have ever seen a movie that is about a stupid looking monster from the ocean that threatens a small town which has to be filled with the dumbest people on earth br br spoilers if you even care br br they can't even kill the damn thing by the end of the movie the movie ends and they're like well some day we'll have to kill it br br avoid at all costs,0
3172,i saw wicked little things as part of the 8 films to die for horrorfest and this was the only film that disappointed me to wit a mom her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the pennsylvania mountains every night however the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find br br i guess the director was banking on his viewers being repulsed that children would be capable of murders and eating human flesh of which there are lavish close ups as a nice homage to george romero because the film just isn't scary otherwise simply put there are far too many establishing shots of the evil kids jogging to their next murder site if someone's gonna get it in the barn there will be a shot of the kids arriving at the barn oh the suspense and then moving in for the kill br br come to think of it why do the kids suddenly walk so slowly when they corner their prey and not that i have any experience in this but i think a shotgun blast will throw a child a lot farther than this film implies nor does it help that the mom is one of the worst parents i've ever seen in any film the lock on the front door is busted you have an eight year old daughter in the woods with bears and mountain lions fix it you moron plus mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age even for a teen pregnancy and there's a pretty unbelievable death which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt br br i'm giving this a 3 because it tried as a splatter film it's not bad but for good scares go elsewhere,0
3173,i went to see the italian job with mixed reviews in my head i was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours i thought the cast was just great and so were the special effects with the safe and truck just dropping out of sight if you like fast paced action movies this is the one to see,1
3174,this is a hollywood film the credentials of those involved are not revolutionary this film will not change the world however it is well made well plotted and well acted which counts for a lot br br it's the cat and mouse story of a disgruntled former cia assassin who feels betrayed chasing a secret service agent who was protecting john f kennedy when kennedy was killed in dallas the agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992 or certainly in contemporary america this would be assassin mitch leary john malkovich in a tour de force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the president he imagines he has common cause with secret service agent frank clint eastwood at his cool calm good naturedly grouchy best who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the warren commission blamed unfairly leary believes for the assassination of president kennedy the tension is up through some phone calls from leary to leary wanting to keep close but not to betray his location and plans br br rene russo is excellent as lily raines a fellow agent with whom develops a grown up relationship it is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers even if russo is a fair deal younger than eastwood at the time of filming russo is a calm capable agent who is able to go toe to toe with the quick witted in friendly banter it is a nice part for russo allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man the acting by the leads wolfgang peterson's competent direction the thoughtful use of music in plot development and excellent cinematography make this a film i can watch over and over,1
3175,better than average world war ii era who dun it featuring warner baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as robert who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight crime doctor's courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems the link to courage is not particularly clear br br this entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter gordon carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but dr labels murder hillary brooke plays the part of widow kathleen carson who is involved with anthony caruso a mysterious spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage as a mystery novelist jerome cowan is a good supporting actor as is lloyd corrigan as an aficionado in crime br br spooky houses with creaking doors caskets in the cellar and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense the set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good direction production design and photography stand out the exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average b detective thriller br br strongly recommended,1
3176,i do not see what is the whole deal about this movie patricia sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough i mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy patricia's cd and enjoy the plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse what at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream i measure movies by how well i would remember them and for this one i already started to forget the details,0
3177,after 30 minutes mostly fast forwarding deleted it off my recorder the first critters movie was self consciously fun the conversation between the critters just before granny blows them away off the porch for example this film just limps along waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery br br i can't imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of it br br one was fun four just was awful don't bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a tbs 700 club fund raiser you'll at least get some good laughs there and the alien makeup is more believable grin,0
3178,new york attorney plots to rid himself of his senile mother after meeting an attractive available woman screenwriter robert klane adapting his own novel the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness to him it's just an excuse for prurient comedy and scatological jokes george segal who in the 1960s starred mostly in war and espionage pictures had become by this time one of america's greatest sad sack comedians his nutty reactions and batty responses rival only his mother's segal is paired well with trish van and their moments of connection though also played for laughs are really the only sequences one can gravitate towards ruth gordon lovable as is she is simply around too much and more of her amounts to less this is one of the worst directed and edited films i have ever seen from so called professionals promising scenes which ultimately don't play out for the full effect are haphazardly disconnected from other moments which flail around endlessly causing the crass rickety movie to self destruct long before it's actually over 1 2 from,0
3179,if you're like me and you occasionally enjoy watching terrible movies i guess it's kind of like slowing down at a car crash you can't do better than this the plot is inane the special effects are hilarious and the acting is some of the worst you'll ever see 4 thumbs down seriously i have no idea how the director and the actors can sleep at night it's painful and yet hysterically funny to watch and i highly recommend it for those who want to punish themselves for something if you can watch this crap without wincing you're a better man than i'll ever be i wonder if the producer of this garbage had any idea what he was getting himself and his money into,0
3180,ok so i admit that it often seems like most of the sylvester tweety pairings have exactly the same plot sylvester tries to get tweety but repeatedly fails and always gets maimed in the process often with the help of a bulldog i guess that it's sort of like wile e coyote chasing road runner in other words mammals should never go after birds all a r r rd has the same plot and sets it on a train in a way the best part of these cartoons is seeing what sorts of schemes sylvester comes up with to try and go after tweety we know that he's going to fail miserably but it's also funny to watch tweety turn into a bad ass if you've seen his really early cartoons you'll see that he was not cute at all but in fact had a cruel streak this one mainly works as a way to pass time br br by the way i thought that i saw i mean i taut i sylvester pass a piece of baggage with the name friz freleng on it,1
3181,i saw the mst3k version of this film and it is a bad movie but its not nearly as bad as its low imdb rating currently 1 8 out of 10 at least the movie has a few production values and it apparently had a competent editor unlike the movies that truly are awful the primary problem with this movie is that it had no appealing characters whatsoever the main character marv is so pathetically morose that he practically asks for all the bad stuff that happens to him and he isn't very smart either or he would have figured out to stay away from the conniving girl betty and even more pathetic than marv is his father who is nothing but a drunken loser the highlight of the film is the heist sequence at the end but even that is so weakly executed any excitement it might have added to the film is completely missing at least this movie made for a very funny mst3k episode as mike and the do a great job making fun of it,0
3182,the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best techno thrillers to come down the pike in a long time the character of solo who is not supposed to look like a human is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminator clone with mario van peebles horrendously trying to act like a robot there is nothing worthwhile about this film br br why does hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solo but don't pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film,0
3183,this is the worst movie i've ever seen and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 which is made by me anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie i mean come on the actors had a bad performance the story is just crap i'm really really disappointed they could have done better stuff than this piece of junk i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie i wish that the production company could give back my money anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie and i've got disappointed i don't recommend anybody to watch this so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk,0
3184,closet land tells a powerful story and has many different subtle elements you could read lots of stuff about the movie's plot before hand but you don't really need to all you need to know is that the movie is all about an interrogation along the way we learn lots of things about the interrogator and the person being interrogated we also learn that the world can be a dark and scary place especially when you have absolutely no control over it br br in the end the movie amounts to a warning really though the movie has several different aspects to it about what happens to people's freedoms when they look the other way and ignore injustices happening to those around them br br if you've got about an hour and a half and know where you can rent this i strongly recommend that you do so,1
3185,if you want to have a great time then this is the movie to watch br br take the premise there is this college which admits people with minimum qualifications of ba b com m com ma mba b e m tech and so you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40 also the school admits students of a dispensation and has a course of p hd in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is only she was a snake in the past life still not convinced ok read on br br here's a scene akshay kumar a college student is chased by and he takes out a bazooka and shoots him then throws grenades then one of the grenades hits akshay but doesn't die and continues to fight the snake plunges a half foot dagger into akshay and stomps on it but akshay is still there then akshay gets on a jet ski and follows they fight and chokes akshay underwater and finally akshay is dead so we think as soon as is out of the picture akshay swims away to raj principal of this college boxing ka professor mumbling priest br br but no one i repeat no one takes the cake but a certain mr you watch to learn more,1

3187,well some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass if that's what you want and you wear a cloak file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool you'll see a fine film br br if like most people an assassin dressed in gleaming creaking rubber with huge cleavage thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh then this is one of the best comedies you'll see i laughed so hard i nearly cried ridiculous acting dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula dead and loving it could be br br it tries to be cool and goth and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious even the tacked on lesbian scene is funny how did she get those boots off that quickly they were laced up to here br br don't see it if you like good films see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over it isn't good it's just bad,0

3190,this is the most human and humane of movies that i have seen in a long time the ironies abound susan sarandon as a nun tim robbins and susan sarandon in a movie that doesn't preach but neither does it condemn it is cinema verite at it's best and yet the story is fictionalized from several real events br br which of the two is more amazing sarandon or penn it is easy to say who is more likeable but it is hard to say who is more convincing they are simply magnificent br br you may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful whatever your personal feeling this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider br br at the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect that is what great drama does it gives catharsis it creates a moment in time a shared memory that touches our humanity,1
3191,to start with i have done some further research on the film jules dassin directed and acted in this extremely imaginative and different film noir crime film secondly this was a very low budget film created in the rennaissance of the prime moment of film noir thirdly the where the robbery was attempted is an actual the producers of rififi asked them to film their surprisingly i quote jules dassin in a recent interview on the subject surprisingly for some not very obvious reason they were delighted at the idea of a crime film being set in their shop br br it's impeccable characters and plot fit in so beautifully with their surroundings to add on to my praise i will say this some might say that this was a typical hollywood film on the contrary this set the base for the regular plot of a hollywood crime film br br i would like to say that i support this fresh idea of a film where not only one side wins and that side doesn't always have to be the good one for once i can say that a film is not predictable ten stars,1
3192,blind spot one of my festival favorites i was totally intrigued by the idea of three strangers searching for a mysterious man who has loved and betrayed each of them in different ways the cast is great james franco is particularly amazing as the broken hearted boy from los angeles his journal entries which we hear in voice over narration work well with the visuals and are quite intense the film has a powerful style it pushes elements like the road movie and revenge drama in new directions it also plays with time and perspective in ways that capture the frightening ambiance of lost love there is a dreamlike quality to several sequences and the images are saturated with an eerie sense of tension strange suspenseful beautiful to look at definitely worth seeing i really would like to see it again periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed i can't wait to see the film again in the cinema or on dvd br br pepe 13 08 2005 bologna italy,1
3193,this movie was made by daiei studios known for its gamera movies it is about a samurai lord who was murdered by one of his own men he claims his throne forcing his former's two children to flee into the woods where they hide near a huge stone statue for 10 years in those time that passed the new samurai lord has proved to be very brutal and ruthless towards the village people and the valley therefore it seems that the good people's only hope is the stone statue which is where a demon god sleeps they want the god to help them br br this samurai movie brings to us traditional japanese aspects including sword fights geisha and worshipers it is a superb and powerful story of survival and hope with the protagonists attempting to triumph over pure evil it is full of excitement particularly the parts where the children struggles to remain in hiding as the evil warlord is out to get them in addition it has beautiful cinematography with luscious landscapes of the village and countryside instantly reminds you of the ancient times in japan br br as with most samurai movies like the seven samuari and the last this movie is no less than pure sometimes graphic action there are several disturbing scenes in the film therefore it is not the casual sci fi film yet it is strong and powerful and delivers a message that a good natured human can overcome any adversaries as depicted in this film even the young innocent girl can calm the wrath of the demon god the scenes of the demon god known as daimajin trampling on its enemies and anything that stands in his way will instantly remind you of a godzilla or gamera film overall a powerful and serious yet hopeful film br br so be careful with your samurai sword you wouldn't want to rattle cages br br grade a,1
3194,rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review br br it's a movie about the serial killer richard speck who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties watching the movie one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter unfortunately that doesn't make for a good movie br br another problem i had was the near constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie and some god awful narration letting us know what's motivating speck the acting was average for this type of film to give credit where credit is due the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste your mileage may vary br br over all if you're interested in the subject matter it may be worth your time,0
3195,this movie have 4 parts and every is around 170 minutes long its based on true story of life of joe and it is telling all how he did see so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it movie make you tied up for chair till the end i think it is possible to watch all 4 in a row and not notice i watched 2 in a row and 2 next day in a row acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor this one show real thing and story is key to this movie so the one who look for same spectacular rambo matrix titanic movie you can skip this one good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different interrupt with something not important to crime business of,1
3196,it is a shame that the gershwin family and goldwyn estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing thereby depriving the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture br br it is also true that the singing voices for sidney poitier and dorothy dandridge were dubbed for this movie and that is used as one of the reasons that the gershwin's do not want this movie ever released again br br for in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the gershwins and the this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to the screen sammy davis jr and pearl bailey are especially deserving praise br br this film was the great independent producer samuel swan song it was also ironically the gershwin's greatest shame br br finally it is a loss to the wonderful black actors who appeared in it for we can no longer see them at their best,1
3197,purchased this film for one dollar and figured i could never go wrong my big mistake was watching it enjoyed the acting of ice t and the rapping which gave lots of class to this film about los angeles and the world of pimps there is a boxer who kills one of his opponents in a practice ring and who has a career but because of mental problems from childhood and the killing of this other boxer he retires he gets hired by a pimp who is looking for a bodyguard to protect the girls that work for him at their trade and make sure they are not beaten up this boxer falls in love with the boss's girlfriend and all kinds of trouble starts this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy,0
3198,i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker it is wrote the script and i could follow it fine despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago br br the soundtrack is execrable jarring jangling and utterly inappropriate breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in alfie a couple of years earlier br br the mysteries evoked by the book are not well translated onto the screen i'd love to see someone remake this one,0
3199,are you kidding me the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog and the music was nothing great anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho couldn't we have had a better line here was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over mixed way to loud music,0
3200,this is a charming movie starring everyone's favorite cartoon chipmunks in this feature we follow the band of rodents on an unforgettable balloon race around the world although there are lows including an orphan penguin all in all it's a great family film,1
3201,from the title the tag line the plot summary on the dvd etc i expected something at least slightly epic with the historical fiction and the romance to thrill you that's what they did in last of the mohicans for example and i think they did a superb job maybe i had standards too high for this movie and didn't give it a fair chance but the scenery was barely ok how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they have such landscapes to work with the two lovers had no chemistry whatsoever and the plot was just so predictable it felt like it had been drafted in 5 minutes by a twelve year old and not a very imaginative one nouvelle france is a love story set in an eventful historical age but the history of nouvelle france is hardly a side note and the love story is banal and fails dramatically to make the viewer care for the lovers' fate surprisingly the only good parts about the movie came from something completely unexpected and the relationship between marie the heroine and her children one natural one adopted if only they'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story it would have been a much better movie marie parents should have been given more screen time and character development the politics going on in britain should have been more than a three minute scene with barely any connection to the rest the rotten baddie should have been either more developed or removed from the script completely why hire actors like vincent perez tim roth or jason isaacs to misuse them so badly bad work overall,0
3202,the best batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares br br although the villains are somewhat cheesy they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography br br the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations br br don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits this is a movie in the pure style of burton that can't be described burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past br br recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all if it deals with super heroes,1
3203,a group of with a sad history take an author on a adventure through an uncharted cave in kazakhstan in these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components the cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an x file i like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little annoyances for me here the camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up not being a it doesn't really matter to me whether the filming was realistic there is entirely too much unnecessary from supposedly experienced by the last half you're saying out loud one of two things  oh just shut up and concentrate on saving yourselves or i hope you all die by the end it must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film a moderate amount of gore and nothing special in the dialog or characters while you're pretty confident you know what's going on by the end the last five minutes explain all the details but i would have had a better opinion of the movie if they would have left the last minute on the cutting room floor it just wasn't necessary i suggest you hit eject immediately after your suspicions are confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel i've long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant industry's checkout scheme you pay for the materials to make the film before you go in but any profits for the film come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema i can't blame what i don't like about this film on its low budget,0
3204,if you decide to watch wild rebels don't expect anything deep and meaningful if you're looking for a film that explores the relationships and structure of a motorcycle gang wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for an expose on the breakdown of the american educational system and the problem of juvenile delinquency wild rebels is the wrong movie if you're looking for a movie that examines how rural police departments are when facing a well financed well organized gang wild rebels is the wrong movie but if you're looking for an absurd movie filled with scene after scene of unintentional humor horrendous acting a paper thin plot and community theater style production values wild rebels is the right movie br br wild rebels is the story of a down on his luck stock car driver named rod tillman steve after a fiery crash which rod walks away from completely unscathed despite having only a cotton pants and a london fog style jacket for protection rod decides to give it up with no plan for his future other than to wander aimless through the back roads of the south he stumbles on the satan's angels motorcycle gang a gang being three of the stupidest guys to ever zip up a leather jacket and a woman they seem to share this group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural town in florida by committing such atrocities as stealing a newspaper from a neighbor's mailbox these bumbling idiots need someone to act as their driver during some larger crimes they have planned apparently these three einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires not four so they recruit rod to perform feats of daring that only an experienced stunt driver would be capable of like keeping the car in the middle of a gravel road during a low speed chase eventually they hold up a bank get into the aforementioned low speed chase and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on film i could go on forever but you get the idea br br i hate the term so bad it's good but that seems to aptly describe wild rebels,0
3205,my friend recommended this movie to me is should have known not to watch it because my friend is kind of a video game nerd but the name and the cover made it look good for some reason i was so wrong i mean first of all what is up with their suits and the acting it seems like they got the people off barney except for ben kingsley and why was he even in this movie did he think it was a comedy but i have to say the special effects were pretty good but that was like the only good thing in it i mean seriously the movie is worse than pearl harbor and thats actually an understatement everyone must have thought oh i am getting paid so it doesn't matter if its the worst movie in the world i would understand why someone would make this kind of movie if they were directing acting producing writing and getting their hopeless life best friend to do filming and editing probably one of the worst sci fi movies ever one truly jacked up film,0
3206,it is a rare and fine spectacle an allegory of death and that is neither preachy nor mawkish a work of mature and courageous insight northfork avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison wim wenders' 1987 wings of desire der himmel über berlin it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural this story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the american west withholds the fairytale that marked its german predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with obsequious sentimentalism its celestial transcendence be it inspired by doleful faith or impelled by a fever dream never parts ways with crud and rot this firm grounding to great credit for writers and directors mark and michael polish,1
3207,i don't understand the people here the film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here except for de the acting is ok the problem with the film is mainly the script the characters are not believable the sex is done okay but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense the film doesn't look good but what do you expect the film was shot for very little money on video off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film duh the one thing i do agree on is that the music is bad sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the '80's the film is not good okay but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money,0
3208,let's get one thing straight this was bad so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories br br the ever repeating storyline who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful as if that doesn't get old har de bloody har some australian quasi nationalist look it up appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercy br br the rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out br br the phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on br br it saddens me though to see someone as good as sally good actress i like her make a prat out of herself o hanlon my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny but not here and ben elton distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this thing then comedy is in very serious trouble,0
3209,dubbed beyond comprehension the hbo version of is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film some scenes simply don't make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading add in the self censorship involving cia operative frank carlucci and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power here's hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point,0
3210,the dvd jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous those are not the words i would have chosen not by a long shot i would choose a word like sombre sometimes even depressing which isn't to say that it's a bad movie it's actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough uncertainty throughout about what's going to happen at the end that you keep watching the uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie it seems to revolve around ellen's reminiscences of her mother's slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the da so we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the end the questions are what and who br br renee zellweger was very good as ellen the somewhat resentful daughter who has to give up her life and job in new york to return home to care for her sick mother ellen evolves through the movie moreso than any other character as she learns to deal with both the strengths and weaknesses of her parents her relationship with her father william hurt is quite interesting my initial impression was that they were quite close but the warts in the relationship start to show after a while hurt was effective as the detached husband detached not in an uncaring way but in the sense of being unable to cope with what's happening to his wife and seeking escape from it in various ways finally meryl streep as the cancer stricken kate was very convincing in the role seeking to live out what remains of her life in the most fulfilling way possible then dealing with the anger she feels at her increasing in a way watching a family deal with this kind of crisis reminded me a little bit of ordinary people although this movie was far less emotionally intense so not uplifting and humorous with all due respect to whoever wrote the synopsis on the dvd jacket but very good in its own way 7 10,1
3211,this movie could have had a lot of potential certainly with today's technology one would expect real special effects but movies are not made with special effects alone of course acting is needed this film lacked both br br first let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible why can't a movie take artistic license if you want to know about the story of moses read the bible i have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact look at of movie from its artistic br br in viewing this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version it fails miserably in that heston and had presence they became their roles you don't see this here br br even if you don't compare standing on it's own this movie to too rushed parts where a scene should be developed it does not it becomes boring br br my advice skip this and watch the other as campy as the other is it's far and away the better movie,0
3212,i rented this movie under the impression that it was scarecrow 3 dark harvest thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies i wasn't disappointed though it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected i was laughing throughout the entire movie every piece of bad acting poorly shot and cut footage and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting br br the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crew's six months of filming br br favorite line the sins of my forefathers they've down to this very moment of time,0
3213,now i loved lethal weapon and kiss kiss bang bang but i cannot believe shane black wrote this pile or that david morse and john c mcginley are in it i screened it for a film festival awful everyone was laughing it's preachy and heavy handed not to mention stupid also it's surprising how little l a looks like cambodia the entire idea of time traveling through post traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb imagine born on the fourth of july mixed with the butterfly effect 2 i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is but directed by michael bay's 2nd unit director that bad the 2 stars are purely based on the production value,0
3214,death wish 3 brings back charles bronson as one time vigilante paul now retired yeah right before long is back to his old ways but this time its not just a few muggers at a time its a gang who have taken over a run down part of the city new york again by the way this time its war so out the big guns literally for this the body count int his one rivals anything stallone or schwarzenegger have come up with this movie is actually somewhat fun to watch particularly for a few one liners and of course bad guys die or get severely injured in creative ways which is always a good thing the violence is not as personal in this one its obviously on a much grander scale sort of like bombing your victims from afar rather than one on one combat this movie is lighter in tone than the 1st 2 making it easier to watch there's not much import to this film its more escapism than anything its also cheesy at times and pseudo inspirational but hose scenes fall flat they should have left the original death wish on its own without sequels but since they didn't they should have stopped here 8 10,1
3215,its a spoof its an intelligent comedy it has some a pathetic action and choreography and mind it it is intentional good hummable songs good performances by the entire cast brilliant by amir salman and paresh and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy watch david dhawan etc story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways they come across one such way when they find out that a rich nri is coming india to get married rest of the story is about and how these wastrels try to out wit each other entire cast is perfectly cast right from verma till viju songs are rightly placed and are funny surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy br br all an all a film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema,1
3216,i first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in theaters way back when seeing it again nearly 30 years later i was surprised at how well it has held up the gags are still funny the interaction between characters works great and the cameos come off better than ever steve martin's has to be the best one br br my kids 9 11 and 14 all loved it and the music is good enough that they are still humming the tunes many days later br br i would suggest that before seeing the movie you should view at least a half dozen episodes of the muppet show to get a sense of the back story behind the characters otherwise the movie won't make all that much sense,1
3217,it's along the line of comedy of errors mistaken affection transferring from one to another blossoms and passes cat and mouse flares of passion sparks of fire fanned and put maybe she loves he loves or they circle of emotions evolving yet not to let him know wanting to let her know let them know good ensemble cast in spite of the seemingly confusing mix of emotions from different parties involved br br it's a refreshing charmer casual free and easy and rather down to earth not hollywood glamorous like notting hill but lots of human feelings frailty vulnerability a flowing yes all revolving around an accidentally lost found love letter kate capshaw as the owner of the town's bookstore with a variety of characters portrayed by ellen degeneres tom selleck blythe danner tom everett scott gloria stuart alice drummond and geraldine mcewan as the seemingly unaffected mrs romance is in the air love lurking everywhere you get to appreciate the talented kate capshaw the alarmist is another quirky little movie which is fun to watch capshaw has a wonderful chemistry with david arquette and arquette with stanley tucci br br notting hill is satisfying in its story revolving around the glittering pairing of julia roberts and hugh grant and the wonderful support of his circle of london friends love letters is delightful in its quirky small town ness and its story involving kate capshaw's ripple effects on her friends and neighbors both maybe fantasies somehow the latter felt more attainable if it should happen to you and if you appreciate words or poetic lines it could be the movie for you,1
3218,the true story of devi who became a national hero in india because she fought for her rights as a woman but in a violent manner i was surprised to see a powerful film with strong images come out of india instead of the bollywood art trash classics they churn out,1
3219,this is easily one of the best movies of the 1950s otto preminger directed only four or five really good movies and this is one of them frank sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by elmer bernstein is dynamite from the opening titles by saul bass to the hysteria of drug addict frank going cold turkey this is a riveting movie with kim novak giving a very good performance eleanor parker giving a very bad performance as well as darren mcgavin as the reptilian pusher and arnold as frank's grifter pal beware of bad prints this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough,1
3220,i caught this on late late mexican cable and i have to rant about it the title was translated as secrets well there's a secret that has an important part in the movie but come on we are not stupid we know there's a novel behind this br br anyways the movie is pretty interesting and it's carried by it's solid performances the always beautiful and stunning jordana brewster and christopher eccleston deliver great performances and have such great chemistry between them cameron is also good although she has minimal on screen time blythe danner is perfect and his last appearance in the movie is touching sad great performances br br character and her sister's ex boyfriend travel to europe in order for her to deal with his demons and understand why her sister died through flashbacks we learn the sad truth and we can't help but feel sorry for the whole family the ending is truly moving br br so there's nudity but it's minimal in fact the sex scenes are artsy and do not intend to be steamy or sexy br br to be honest i kept watching it for brewster's on screen charming and beauty and i ended up liking the story and the dramatic presentations br br give this movie a try if you like solid dramatic features great movie the last last scene was very sad the two little sisters through flashbacks,1
3221,the beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable it was just one of those movies that i came across in my netflix instant queue and i thought it would be interesting to see brad and bijou phillips team up together again since bully unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time phillips but swain likes one of the boys from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them and of course like all other movies things are good or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids br br the problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys it is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it you feel you could have done anything better some scenes the ones with parents don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it at all br br all the interesting things that could have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode mischa barton and rachel bison from the oc br br the only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a one rating from me is phillips they needed more scenes with her in it just look like he brought over a bit of his character from bully and for pete's sake the title is bs change the name,0
3222,as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct to video grade c porn movie in which either a the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts an amazing thing if it were true br br i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs which seemed to imply a john waters style humor fest with a sexual theme okay i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way but on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly on this one you fast forward because you already know what they're about to say but there's nothing to fast forward to so just fast forward past it on the shelf,0
3223,ingmar bergman's meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast of what country isn't specified raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports as they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age this is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person's point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head what do i do now as an intellectual exercise the film is top notch this is a film that will make you think as an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving i was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops i should state that i admire bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table however i have never been moved by his films i am not a fan i always sided with fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war for most of us is just a thing on a tv screen,1
3224,ok i know the original ghoulies aren't in this entry it even seems it doesn't belong in this series but it still a good movie it is hilarious i thought especially with the pepper spray or mace i give it a 9,1
3225,i hope the writer director editor and composer and let's not forget producer read this because their work was truly incredible on this movie let me start by saying that i am in no way affiliated with this movie i am only a regular guy who has been a fan of this movie for about 12 years and have seen it about 8 times br br every second of this movie is touching every scene is classic the acting is real the movie is honest you can relate to these characters as people not actors br br this tale follows three distinct killers at different stages in their lives the story is carefully thought out and every sub plot is intertwined and woven together culminating in a message that leaves us pondering the values of right and wrong that each of us carries inside br br crispen glover daniel roebuck dennis hopper and joshua john miller as a 12 year old boy give absolutely amazing real performances i've seen this movie about 8 or more times and i still get so absorbed in their performances that i forget i am watching a movie it's that good great job everyone who worked on this great job br br the music is also wonderfully matched and haunting with the chosen cast the carefully timed editing and pacing the mood and tone and even the subject matter the director made some of the best decisions for a movie i've ever seen br br this movie is real it's honest it's a true movie experience which i will never forget you may not be into the subject matter but it is something you cannot ignore ultimately it's about people being people and everyone can relate to that i recommend this movie to fans of drama suspense and horror above almost every other film,1
3226,i neglected this film when i used to go to the movie store but then the curiosity got to me and i decided to check it out i loved it the movie starts off with judy and jay heading for a halloween party at the abandoned funeral parlor hull house then we meet a few more characters angela and the hosts frannie max rodger sal and helen then of course they start to party and when really in the mood they decide to have a séance which awakens a demon the demon possesses angela and she starts her gruesome slaughtering will they survive the night of the demons br br the movie was overall great the gore was fine but the nudity provided by linnea quigley trash from rotld once again screws it i never was a fan of hers and never will be,1
3227,i had never heard of before then i saw it on toon disney and instantly loved it i also think that it is not just for kids and that people of all ages would enjoy it it has a great plot great effect and cool characters i will always love the show and i heard it will be coming on on dvd worldwide soon and i'm going to get it i haven't read any of the books but i intend to the show deserves a 10 out of 10 and i hope the books are just as good well that's all i have to say but i still have 2 lines i have to fill up so who do you all think is the coolest character mine is shade and my second favorite is marina,1
3228,this one was a surprise and better than most films i've seen recently highly enjoyable from start to finish this is a film that will surely satisfy 99 9 of movie fans worldwide great acting from everyone great script great story and fantastic plot and twists try not to miss it,1
3229,but george and gracie's are not among them the movie is fun and the pool table scene with wc fields has to be among the funniest i have ever seen but gracie and george are more irritating than comical in their roles partly from script deficiency and partly from their interpretation i gave it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast wc is a treasure of comedic timing and energy in this one,1
3230,dear readers 2001 a space odyssey is kubrick at his best although i really can't say that as space odyssey is his only film i've ever watched but still it's a good film strange but good br br the movie is in three acts much like the novel which is unsurprising since the author wrote the screenplay anyhow we first start out with the simple yet spectacular opening with also blaring on the speakers then comes the boring beyond belief 'dawn of man' sequence then there's the odd 'finding of the sequence on the moon played to blue danube finally things get good with the spaceship scenes and hal going berserk and killing people after that things die down and we have the the sequence which was way too long and the ultra strange ending even though 2001 a space odyssey is a good film it's not star wars stargate terminator or the abyss but it rocks my compliments to the chef mr kubrick br br signed the constant dvd collector,1
3231,i just saw this at the toronto international film festival in the beautiful elgin theatre i was blown away by the beautiful cinematography the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least the bravura performance of al pacino who was born to play this role which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from jeremy irons br br the film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty law vs justice and passion vs reason some might protest that the content is inherently anti semitic however they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptation br br 9 10,1
3232,i've just seen this film in a lovely air conditioned cinema here in bangkok and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around with very high humidity my was not wasted br br failing that i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well made junk in a long time this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste as it were anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws br br pseudo profundity and fat lips while characteristic of much french cinema really do not a good movie make i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time,0
3233,i have to admit that i absolutely loved this movie of course as i'm sure you know that in the middle star frankie and the ever so sweet amanda bynes the amanda show starred in this children's comedy as two friends that i'm sure that we can all re late to the movie is about a boy jason shepard frankie and his friend amanda going onto an adventure in hollywood br br spoilers ahead br br as it begins jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems one day jason is hit by mr wolf the big bad director jason's english paper is stolen by wolf and begins the adventure along with to earn his father's trust back they fly to hollywood in search of wolf to get him back frankie and amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get wolf back and all he has to do is call jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea but the end is no real surprise being the good and wins br br the story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it's rated pg i really belive this is one of the years best family comedies not only is the childrens acting great exceptional casting well written but it's good clean fun it made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message i highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten the unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing i give it well i voted a ten out of ten a perfect,1
3234,i consider this film to be a complete masterpiece actually i consider it to be fernando best work and undoubtedly the best of all portuguese movies i don't think you can come across such a zero budget kind of film as impressive and astonishing as this one br br the direction is done with perfection at an incredible fast pace and the music also composed by fragata is mostly excellent the story is creepy and humorous at the same time and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying misery loves company kind of situations intertwined with a mind boggling mystery a more than perfect recipe to glue the viewers' eyes to the screen from frame one to the last br br it's been called neo hitchcock and i'll agree much like the best hitchcocks it kept me guessing during the entire film and most of my suppositions were far for what ends up being smartly revealed,1
3235,james cagney the yankee doodle dandy boy was just starting his career and was able to perform as a gangster and also a social worker for a boys reform school which is being run by corrupt the reform school inmates are minors from the streets of new york like the east side kids who were poor and for during the great depression in the final scenes there is a trial held by the reform school boys with flaming torches and a barn which is set on fire and a big leap by the corrupt warden i noticed that they did let the horses out of the barn first this film is not shown very often and i really can understand why,1
3236,even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group i really enjoyed this movie it's a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star i know it was mine to be sure the first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it i loved the relationship between jd and jane it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well i also liked the family set up for jane her sisters seemed lovely very well made film,1
3237,this is a really really bad movie however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and special effects the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth they send a mission they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet is anybody stupid enough to fall for this to the planet and can you believe it it's the mirror image of the planet they came from most everything is predictable from that point honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything the only surprising thing here is a space program run by there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness,0
3238,i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable tv and i can't understand why geena outdoes arnold as an action hero in this film geena is an ex cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else especially when someone tries to kill her it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does she hires samuel l jackson who is a former police officer together they form a pair that is as entertaining as mel gibson danny glover when geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song she's not there playing in the background what follows is geena and samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive all through the rest of the film geena has to decide who she really is the killing unfeeling machine the mother schoolteacher with the quiet family life or a combination of both especially since the bad guys grab daughter great action scenes that rank up with any of the die hard movies,1
3239,ok enough already this is a terrible piece of television the camera work is appalling do i have to remind you of the crunchy gravel so loud you can hardly hear the actors speak lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the entire world anna massey is 'acting' in such an unbelievable fashion and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is beyond beyond also the bertram girls aren't pretty enough and the guy playing henry crawford is awful to say the camera work is dodgy is an understatement i watched this adaptation over christmas and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time br br i am a fan of faithful to jane adaptations so i could not bear the film adaptation or the recent pride and prejudice movie but see any other adaptation instead even emma is better than this,0
3240,or that's what the filmmakers would like you to believe anyway br br this movie tries sooo hard to be cool it's ridiculous everything from the look of the film the cinematography the editing the dialogue and the acting is geared in super cool mode from the get go just to make sure that no one misses how cool this film is there's a soundtrack of really cool rock n roll tunes and a twangy western surf tex guitar playing constantly throughout the film as a final reminder of how frickin cool this movie is all the actors have been instructed to speak in a hoarse voice because as we all know that's badass br br the plot if there indeed is one seems pretty straightforward but as someone else already pointed out the director and star of the film seems fiercely determined not to tell that story instead focusing on a plethora of naked babes and dialogue that's supposed to be badass but grows tired surprisingly quick did they have an contest to see how many times they could cram the words pussy and f ck and its derivatives in an 80 minute film br br this movie was absolutely horrible,0
3241,luchino visconti the artist with the sword courage should be the first word associated with his entire opus film theater music revolutions artistic cultural personal a legacy with powerful consequences and endless ramifications he introduced the neorealism through the work of an american novelist james cain in he gave anna magnani the most extraordinarily beautiful close ups of her career he gave us alain delon and maria but the last word about his life and work rests on the talents of a certain adam low and the voice of helmut berger what a terrible fate br br for those interested there is a 61 minute documentary by director carlo a man who really knew visconti titled luchino visconti a portrait it is out on dvd distributed by image entertainment,0
3242,surprisingly good film made in the wake of the exorcist concerning a young woman who becomes possessed by a spirit after she goes to a de sanctified church to restore a life size and life like crucified man the piece was christ and the two thieves however christ was long ago sold off trouble starts once the figure is removed from the cross and it seems to come to life and seduce the woman from that point on it becomes a battle for the girls soul creepy scary and much better than you think the film works because its cast sells the events which are decidedly adult it helps that these are real people who are flawed so its easier to relate to them i really liked this film and seeing it again for the first time in at least a decade i was shocked at how good it is definitely better than any of its myriad of schlocky titles makes it seem,1
3243,riding high on the success of rebel without a cause came a tidal wave of movies arguably this is one of the best a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence the supporting cast is memorable frankenheimer directs like an old pro just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously,1
3244,the danish bladerunner is boldly stated on the box are you kidding me this film is a complete drag when i'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen i usually pause the vcr so i won't miss anything not this time i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge just so i wouldn't have to go back why the hell is there not one scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work it's one of the premises of film is that our hero who's a hacker has a little to help him the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future when he loses the assistant in the movie he's helpless and can't get into any computers he's a hacker it's like saying that you can't drive your car if you don't have your lucky driving cap on i won't even go into the lightning effect when he recieves electroshock,0
3245,the lovely yet lethal alexandra stunning statuesque blonde beauty stacie randall who looks absolutely smashing in a tight black leather outfit must find a magic amulet so her evil demonic master faust can cross over into our dimension it's up to fearless rugged cop jonathan graves likable peter to stop her meanwhile two pitifully unfunny comic relief dwarf gnome creatures run amok in los angeles seasoned veteran schlock exploitation expert jim wynorski relates the supremely inane story at a brisk pace and takes none of this foolishness remotely seriously the cast struggle gamely with the silly material the adorable barbara alyn woods as sassy fetching police captain kate raquel as tart sexy hooker jeanine bobby di as graves' bumbling excitable partner scotty peggy as alluring museum curator monica and ace mask as the jolly dr rochelle mark puerile cookie cutter script an amusingly lowbrow sense of no brainer humor chuck bouncy cornball score the two dwarf guys sporting obvious cheap rubber halloween masks j e plain cinematography no tension or gratuitous female nudity to speak of and the tacky less than special effects all further enhance the overall delicious cheesiness of this prime slice of celluloid velveeta an entertainingly brainless piece of lovably lousy dreck,1
3246,that's right the painter and the main character is an exceptional person what strikes me most is the message this film might address to all of you people there and the message is sad it says that it's very difficult to do anything that's amazing or maybe even genius without having to obey the governments establishment and other of this world and even if you try you might not be able to bear it it is about the battle of a single person with a system with many systems br br a great film of this wonderful korean director please see it if you do have an opportunity,1
3247,unbelievable philosophy depth genius masterpiece people must have seen another oldboy because the one i've seen was a badly written poorly conceived over the top acted sordid piece of which even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old br br the depth of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom laugh and the whole world will laugh with you weep and you'll find yourself alone the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author be him shakespeare or more to the point of imdb kurosawa would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts where this movie should have landed too if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once great art in short yuck br br 2 out of 100 it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera work in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness though,0
3248,the emperor and the assassin w english subtitles at 161 minutes is long but the time is packed with a story that barely fits into it golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panoramas of chinese landscapes background a true story of china's unifying king circa 300 an intricate plot with a myriad twists and turns is played out with excellent portrayals by the cast king simple wish for a unified empire for his common people is fulfilled but not without treachery plots and counter plots and oh yes bodies lots of bodies this epic story of china's beginnings is a great way for westerners to glimpse little known asian history emperor include the thousands of life size terra cotta figures which are still being excavated today as an historical person this film makes it clear that emperor should be regarded along with george washington napoleon bonaparte alexander the great genghis khan and julius caesar to name a few of the world's greatest i highly recommend seeing the emperor and the assassin especially on the big screen,1
3249,this is a spin off of pulp fiction i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs well it turns out that this movie really was terrible the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot it turns to other movie like forrest gump and more some laughs came out of this movie but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me if you are thinking of renting this movie please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense please if there is a plump fiction 2 i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel just giving a heads up for those out there,0
3250,having endured this film last night i turned off the dvd player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end throughout the film i felt that i was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local high school amateur society br br the only saving grace for this movie was that it had amy adams and harriet harris in its credits other than that it was pure dribble,0
3251,1 must be as the reviewer in the new york times who preferred the janis joplin big brother and the holding company album to the just released beatles' white album was called either evil or insane national velvet is a great film elizabeth taylor's performance is fantastic and i fail to discern even a trace of accent much less too much of one her performance is very natural authentic and unbelievably charming the rest of the cast is superb especially rooney and revere br br as far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental i suggest cc has too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight forward emotion and human interaction there was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner not that this film doesn't have a slight hint of the magical permeating through it that is the reason to tell the story one might as well criticize the wizard of oz king kong the maltese falcon casablanca the black stallion the other great horse film or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life no my friend national velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself with tongue firmly not in cheek something today's jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate,1
3252,this movie twists the facts of anne and mary's lives into something unrecognizable to make mary boleyn who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature and make her the good sister is just silly it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character and that is why it is her life and not mary's that has been told so often br br in response to an earlier review i fail to see how anne's life was so criminal to me it's henry who was the real criminal whatever anne's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real life events took place anne in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time was a relatively innocent figure most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and that this movie perpetuate about her and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone without knowing anything about this period in history could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as fact br br i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the 16th century so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie it's a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying to put it mildly br br anne of the thousand days is not accurate either but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history don't even think about renting this it's two hours you'll never get back,0
3253,this is a great movie too bad it is not available on home video,1
3254,this is a brilliant film the story starts off in romania where billy crystal stars as an agent who can talk anybody into doing anything there is a really funny scene here where crystal is a child and talks his father who is a rabbi into eating pork you may know that this is a parody of crystal's religion he is mainly a talent scout and he's trying to find a suitable villain for his latest movie after finding out that the whole film has a terrible crew he accidently falls into a small river believing he is dead some huge hands come out to reach him he later thinks he is in heaven he finds out that he isn't but that he is in a monastery believing god saved him he becomes a monk searching for who saved him he later finds a 7 ft 7 in man who he casts as the perfect villain he also recites shakespeare see the film and find out the rest,1
3255,why is it better because it's true to the dark vision of the comic because the imagery is inventive and unlike the first there are real moments of fear and pathos in this one the first one had too much of jack nicholson's shtick too much prince music and an awkward romance here instead of one villain there are three no robert wuhl and the leading lady is more than just a pretty face in fact pfeiffer is the 1 attraction of this film her transformation is what drives the running theme teetering on the edge of sanity and insanity good and evil she becomes truly fearsome the costumes and makeup are excellent danny devito's penguin is inspired and anguished not just a nut his circus gang posse is the one element of comic relief besides that giant duck max shrek is the only character i'd have toned down walken is pretty hammy as the ruthless businessman danny elfman's score is a perfect fit as usual and the siouxie and the banshees song face to face is easily the best of any of the songs from any of the films a perfect match of musical artist and film soundtrack the least campy of the films it is macabre doesn't pander and demands second and third viewings like an amusement park ride bravo tim burton and cast,1
3256,i watched this after seeing death tunnel this being without question the worst movie i've ever seen in my life so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one first of all i thought the director and producer were the same guy they both are kid rock meets dawg the bounty hunter i watched the taps investigation and i am not a skeptic i think taps is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field that was cool and believable i do believe they are haunted br br but this like the reviewer above mentioned like taking a tour okay a tour fine but the investigators and group leaders seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not so when they have fantabulous stories i have to take it with a heaping of salt br br as someone else mentioned i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50 of the time the rest of the time i couldn't make out anything also without any context to the photos time of day type of camera moisture in the room dust particles which 75 are what the orbs are weather and a ga other factors i cant accept them i also cant help thinking that some might be doctored br br why would that band keep the numbers from the door vandalism also during the taps investigation they tried to dig up the death certificates of those nurses and they only found one which was ruled accidental people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide yet when one of the guides was mentioning this he said yep and its marked suicide it really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in october br br i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital s that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions and weren't some ghoulish wardens they weren't the best methods but its all they had they were desperate to stop the disease,0
3257,opera is a great film with some wonderful imaginative imagery an opera singer cristina is being stalked by a killer who forces her to watch him murder everyone she knows by tying her up and taping needles under her eyes this idea of the needles comes from the fact that argento doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies for years i've been annoyed by people covering their eyes during the gorier moments in my films i film these images because i want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away so i thought to myself 'how would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to watch most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avert their eyes 'the answer i came up with is the core of what opera is about says argento plenty of suspense wonderful cinematography and brutal gory murders one guy is stabbed in the throat with a knife causing a gushing wound daria gets shot in the eye while looking through the peephole etc for anyone who hasn't caught this one yet give it a try highly recommended,1
3258,two soldiers is an excellent example of fine film making the director and producer took a heart warming story and brought it to life with a very skilled and dedicated cast excellent cinematography and very creative artistry br br the relaxed back woods lifestyle of the brothers was depicted with great details and contrasted sharply with the militaristic lifestyle that they were thrust into the interaction between the brothers brought laughter and tears as they struggled with a hard but peaceful life in the back woods of north carolina and an even harder life of war br br the acting was great particularly from the younger brother who is new to the big screen played by jonathan to the older brother played by ben allison and the powerful performance by the colonel played by ron perlman the performance was extremely well cast br br it was a pleasure to enjoy the magic of two soldiers and i heartily recommend it to audiences of all ages,1
3259,this movie should have been billed as three movie summaries linked together to form a full length feature film including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets be warned the first hour of this movie is simply a re hash of the first two aztec movies as told by the main character the actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over i must say the overacting on the part of the bat is quite hilarious br br as for the robot i thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human the robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot body as tom servo put it he's not that impressive he doesn't even have knees that and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room but once he catches you watch out he'll disintegrate you with a touch powered by radium ease br br this is a great movie when accompanied by joel and the bots otherwise you're just a glutton for abuse,0
3260,this movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen dennis quaid's performance was high school caliber while it's difficult to portray an off the wall character like jerry lee lewis it can be done just ask jamie foxx although ray charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than lewis ever dreamed of possessing the phillips brothers portrayal belonged in the dukes of hazzard and alec baldwin playing jimmy is a bit like donald duck performing shakespeare when robert duvall played a country preacher i bought it baldwin never made me believe a single word wynona ryder's part was the best and she was mediocre and can anyone figure out how she was 13 when lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later some checking on the internet reveals the essential facts presented by the film were true at least no more fouled up than most hollywood bio pics this film did badly at the box office and it should have,0
3261,i was forced to watch this film for my world geography class this film is what is wrong with america today instead of figuring out the best way out of hard times or situations we would rather complain about how it is someone else's fault this film goes through the downfall of flint michigan and blames it 100 on general motors in the process of doing so moore goes to great lengths to make the executives of general motors out to be villains just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society moore films several throughout the film and does not ever even ask once if the person is being evicted because of a gm additionally he never interviews the landlords of the tenants filmed moore goes to great lengths to twist historical events to fit his political agenda in this film of pure propaganda,0
3262,death wish 3 is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery all the characters apart from bronson's paul of course exist merely to be killed either as provocation the good guys or as retribution the villains the director simply pours on the mindless violence people even get burned alive and blown up turning this into an urban version of commando and charlie like arnold rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire fans of this short of thing and apparently there are many will enjoy it others beware 1 2,0
3263,what a truly moronic movie all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his br br you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you that'll be 11 95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way don't get me wrong i like weird movies 'the could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie despite casting j lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion this isn't one of those movies and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say oooooh what a masterpiece the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity when in actual fact all it is is bird excrement on a board br br keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie br br thanks for reading,0
3264,i really liked two coyotes one of my friends rented it the other night and we were really impressed with how good it was and how cool the main guys were i wonder if they are thinking of making a sequel because that would be excellent br br two coyotes rocks,1
3265,as a film buff i obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film my favourite being woody allen's quip if i had my life to live over again i wouldn't change anything except for seeing the musical remake of lost horizon therefore i've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography set songs etc just recently i came across a widescreen dvd and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation he really enjoyed it and after trying to block out all the negative prejudices i obviously had about the film so did i there is nothing especially bad about lost horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies it isn't even especially camp the lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them as for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since liv olivia hussey and peter finch were dubbed brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly and sally kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style vocally duet with olivia hussey on the things i will not miss is excellent special mention should be made of the legendary hollywood star charles boyer's brilliant performance as the high lama and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world i wouldn't claim for a second that lost horizon is a masterpiece the things i wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and bobby van's question me an answer number which could easily have been cut but if you haven't even seen lost horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is,1
3266,like almost everyone else i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000 it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time i really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though it's really really really really really really really really really really bad br br miles o'keeffe stars as ator a muscle bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes yeah right there's also a fairly attractive actress can't remember her name who wears a hub cap as a chest shield oh and i can't forget that wacky asian side kick thong he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking and he failed miserably br br the film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper mst3k format if you watch that version you'll laugh yourself silly br br i'm huge br br rating 1,0
3267,this movie is extremely funny and enjoyable with suitable funny and experienced casts i find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in various scenes kevin kline a good comedian has done a good job at being funny in many parts of the film along with tom selleck who is amazingly different from many of his other films the humor within this film are goofy which makes various exaggerations within many scenes especially the beginning bits joan cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated and the same goes for all the other casts this film has many elements of goofy humor and is enjoyable if you want to laugh,1
3268,this movie could have been summed up in about 10 minutes i don't know what everyone else was smoking calling this a beatiful film i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth yes folks it is that bad you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect do not waste your time,0
3269,christmas in connecticut is a gem of a christmas movie classic while lesser known than some others it is nonetheless a delightful way to spend an evening at holiday time i watch it every year br br barbara stanwyck is perfectly cast as elizabeth lane the single career girl way before it was popular stanwyck embodies the single girl on the rise her nyc apartment and her friendly uncle restaurateur around the corner the single girl in the city existence she can't cook yet she writes a column for a magazine br br dennis morgan is also perfectly cast as our wartime hero jefferson jones who wants to meet the amazing elizabeth lane after being lost at sea all he wants is to spend christmas in a real home which sets up the delightful madcap story that evolves it is fun from beginning to end we should all have an uncle felix too,1
3270,well what's wrong with the title separate lies accused elsewhere of not being exciting it's cunning subtle and a bit poetic of course there's a phil collins song and a james belushi film called separate lives which are alluded to here br br but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes ok it's not an in your face hilarious title but then it's not an in your face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance they do try to make people think about important things as here how far do you go to protect your life even if it is a bit rotten against unexpected disaster maybe you tell lies maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies that can wear a lot of people out br br american movies on this theme are abundant but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms which are not a part of everyday life here in europe br br maybe we're not so exciting over here but we don't expect slogan like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public,1
3271,then the second half of this movie is hard to follow i got the first part with the spanish but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain the movie does little to fill you in on what happened and i don't remember much about it so the movie gets confusing then the movie begins when daughter of a rich merchant is accused of by the church specifically father lorenzo she is put to the question and forced to confess even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp in hopes of getting released all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo who runs off to france br br then the movie skips many years and the french revolution is in full force is released from prison it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help she tells him she had a child in prison goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo whom is now with the french and in power he is the father goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo whom decides it's best to send her off to america so no one will find out but before his plans get carried out the british join the and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted that part is not well told in the film it's like the film shows this to happen in a day br br final verdict the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the then the movie expects you to understand what is going on it just got too confusing to me then,0
3272,my favorite film this year great characters and plot and the direction and editing was smooth visually beautiful and interesting br br set in barcelona the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine the leading role would never have been cast in hollywood but he carried the part perfectly the characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate there were two especially noteworthy scenes the climax was truly inspired the film is sentimental and the last ten minutes could have been cut but it was wonderfully entertaining br br i nearly didn't watch it but did just to see audrey tautou her role although billed second or third was minor and was outshined by several other characters i wish more films like this were made it brought to mind the big chill or the breakfast club don't start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1 2 way through,1
3273,remarkably well done but under recognized because of limited distribution has big studio feel understands the horror genre speeds along with clever plot twists and never stumbles could have been a college cult classic if it had ever gotten the opportunity,1
3274,i was permanently scarred by this terrible film br br the main action of the movie is nothing special it seems there's a tribe of snake worshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers i suppose among some men this is enough to make a horror movie anyway occasionally chinese men would wander into the village take a fancy to the local girls seduce them and then abandon them unfortunately for the men the women had put them under a spell derived from snake venom which would make them die horribly in 100 days their swollen like a pregnant woman's with live worms and snakes if they did not return br br forget the cover of the us video this has nothing to do with vampires though there is one inept blood drinking scene the title itself is only marginally appropriate is the latin verb meaning to lie beneath and it's the root of the word succubus a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep actually it's the men who are the here br br but it's not the main action of this ludicrous film that's so objectionable it's the little side incidents i'll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that's performed on screen the participants seem very experienced as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life and i'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards though i resent having the act thrust in my face as entertainment br br what i wish i could overlook or had overlooked are the numerous totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth in the course of the movie he devours a bug a lizard a toad i had to leave the room after this and a whole mouse i stopped watching at this point and lost my appetite for days let me stress that this was totally unexpected and had nothing to do with the movie unless it's a cynical reference to love as it's portrayed in the film a blind selfish predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless but then again i'm probably just to get the vileness out of my head,0
3275,not often it happens that a great last movie becomes such a moving performed and filmed masterpiece the cast is excellent as well as the camerawork what starts up as a merry coming together of a group of well educated citizens of an early 20th century dublin turns into a dark philosophic narration about all our fear from death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past thank you mister huston for this last piece of great cinema,1
3276,writer director patrice takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject friendship and turns it into a flat and meaningless farce despite a list actors fine cinematography and elegant production design it's all in the plot and the plot is laughable teach me how to be likable art dealer françois daniel auteuil tells a random stranger boon and that about sums it up we learn next to nothing about friendship and daniel auteuil may be a fine actor but not one minute do we believe he could be the cut throat egoist the script depends on him to be just as we hope the travesty is over pulls one of his usual cathartic third acts fast forwarding from damage to disaster like treasured greek vase everyone and everything in this movie is a fake only asset is julie in the part of business partner catherine looking swell and sexy despite a major mishap of a haircut,0
3277,if you'd like a great april fool's joke then please by all means show this film to someone however it is important that you in no way criticize the film but instead talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how they just don't make great films like this any more as your victim watches many disconnected and nonsensical scenes such as a cute dog getting punted for no apparent reason a cow standing on the bed a woman licking a statue's feet or jesus apparently raping a woman make lots of comments using words like brilliance juxtaposed or transcendent all the while acting as if the film actually makes perfect sense and isn't a complete waste of an hour of your life also be sure to keep a straight face and feign shock when and if they say that they either didn't understand it or thought it had all the artistry of a cow patty then to further mess with them show them all the comments on imdb as nearly all except for a few trouble makers like and talk about what genius and artistry this film is by the time you are done with this little charade they'll most likely think they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist br br this to me is the only possible reason to watch this horrid mess of a film that or you could show it to the prisoners at guantanamo in order to get them to talk br br if you ask me the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet elvis painting are superior artistically,0
3278,what is this its so bad the animation looks so terrible it looks like a ps1 type game the actors are awful they just cannot act to save their lives i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life i've not heard of this film did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd a girl got shot what is up with that it was just a stupid film they totally copied 'the day after tomorrow' its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this you could spend your time watching 'the day after tomorrow' its a lot better well thats what i think of the film actually why have i wasted my time writing about it ah dam its really annoying me its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now,0
3279,spoiler alert br br i don't go into 'high movies expecting them to be 100 accurate on all things computer related but somehow even the average 'i have a user is supposed to believe that br br 1 a computer professional with a top secret special data br br 2 is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1 44 floppy br br 3 and make absolutely no backup of this special secret data br br even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake br br also this is the worst of a computer nerd ever even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends neighbors extended family or coworkers who can identify her even the had a family that could turn him in br br end spoiler br br these aren't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie these are the major plot points that fueled the storyline the characterization was awful the plot wholly and if you haven't seen this don't bother,0
3280,maybe it was the fact that i saw spider man the day before i saw wild but i do not think that there can be any excuse for this movie being as bad as it was the cast was there to do it but it seemed as if once they found them selves with a decent cast they had to try and make them fit into the movie the only problem was that they did not fit i did not like any of the characters and the story was sketchy at best i left wondering why i spent my money on this movie,0
3281,it's initial premise is based on the american civil war but it's ultimately a love story we start at the beginning of the war where the main characters kidman law are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war the main thrust of this film is for law's character to return to kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns the reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before law's character leaves for battle it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact everything else is just about fine renee zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great an honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless,1
3282,i like many others saw this as a child and i loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood i have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on tv someday since it originally played on usa networks does anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on tv again maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again i don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only know of the stepford wives and stepford husband movies no one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version maybe they should also do a re make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller horror flicks well if anyone has any input please i beg of you write me with information thanks taira aol com,1
3283,i always loved this film the music story and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards is his forte' after all julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie's singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music i was glad when the dvd arrived now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again,1
3284,this is without question one of the worst movies i have ever seen however it is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious i like to compare it to plan 9 in that it can be so bad so awful so dumb and such a waste of time that i find myself laughing out loud br br one of my biggest problems with it is that it's a complete ripoff of robin hood and let be honest and say that i love robin hood with errol flynn and robin hood men in tights but let's face it from the forbidden love between peck who is definitely slumming it although in all fairness this was still a good few years before the masterpiece to kill a mockingbird and the female character who is so forgettable apparently that i have forgotten her name to the final scene where the good guys dress up as monks to fool the bad guys screams robin hood all over it br br however i don't think the film isn't worth seeing on the contrary i think that this is one of the funniest movies i've seen in years even if it was unintentional,0
3285,additionally titled burning man and flash fire for its various releases this australian made film shot in new south wales is problematic for its producers from its outset due to several personality conflicts and extended shooting time that prematurely uses up its allocated budget and although the storyline is at times nicely detailed below standard post production finishing and overmuch cutting jettisons the affair tom skerritt plays as howard anderson an american entrepreneur with a passion for building who is in process of a tourist hotel in the blue mountains region all the while unaware that his business partner julian guy has insured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars far more than its actual worth and plans its destruction as corollary to normal summer brush fires in order to collect a handsome sum through fraud in line with this illicit scheme arranges for an arsonist to perform the incendiary deed a young man who also happens to be the boyfriend of anderson's daughter and due to the future being in the midst of a critical fire hazard sector one of the many unexplained elements of the screenplay julian has every expectation that his dastardly design will come about without serious hindrance as the local insurance firm victimized by the crime is majority owned by the naturally skeptical lloyd's of london deploy senior investigator george james mason to probe into the nature of the made more sinister because of the death possibly a homicide of an insurance investigator wendy hughes who in following clues was apparently coming close to the cause of the arson the setting for the film is the week before christmas of summer in the antipodes a dramatic background but the links within the story are not smoothly compounded resulting in the presentation of events that are rather difficult for a viewer to follow a problem heightened by erratic editing the mentioned heavy cutting and poor sound and picture quality skerritt's semi comatose and droning style is fatally by this dim sound processing but mason is very effective as ever and enjoys the best dialogue with hughes impressive as the too early written out investigator wins acting laurels with his performance as the malevolent julian,0
3286,sharky's machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas erotic and violent the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in atlanta and delivering a chaotic detective case to you the viewer on a silver platter dedicated and determined sharky must stop the murder of a lovely lady of the night who's is anything but ordinary before long sharky's crimefighting machine uncovers a conspiracy of the highest order which threatens to corrupt the inner body of atlanta as a resident of metro atlanta i recall the excitement in town during the movie's production sharky's machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of atlanta twenty years removed and 2 000 000 more people later the film stands the test of time trust me atlanta has not changed one of the highlights of the picture is dar robinson's daring stunt a classic symbolic ending it was even featured on that's incredible abc's reality show of the period it's just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one kick back each your popcorn and watch sterling silver cinema action,1
3287,when fellini committed 8 1 2 to film many commented that it was the most personal vision ever to find its perfect expression when dante cast to the flames of his undying passion many were aghast at the honest brutality of his unrequited feelings for a younger woman when and a merry band of wickedly talented and filmmakers from the mecca of movie making insanity band together during the course of two chilly weeks in december 2000 many commented that nothing more sophmoric had ever been committed much less on film br br well to the doubters out there watch this original piece and find out why the id is both a charming and powerful thing and if that doesn't roll over and rub one out it's probably time you did so br br kudos on a great piece of art,1
3288,i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber i kinda liked it it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids which is to climb mt whitehead of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways but none too differently than they were as children richard lewis is still neurotic richard belzer is still a playboy franklyn is still sort of the dear abby of the group and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group of course the top billed star is louie anderson a true believer in everything cub scout related he still lives in the same house with his mother still goes over the cub scout manual daily is brave reverent and clean and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting compounding their task however is the brothers two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit albeit harmlessly not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out all in all the movie still has bits of charm observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot for example and you have a really funny bit going for you upon further review the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure,0
3289,night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy 80's demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie a definite welcome addition after the 80's were overrun by slasher flicks it was nice to see something a little different br br the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour hosted by angela about 40 minutes of boozing and eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens add some snazzy make up effects lots of gore and cool looking demons and you've got yourself a sweet 80's cheese fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon related films in many horror fans' lists br br firstly i loved the setting for this movie hull house is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge that's when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear this movie spawned 2 sequels the first one in 1994 which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come br br all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that's definitely worth checking out,1
3290,seagal was way off the mark with this film i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this instead it had injections and cheesy music even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead,0
3291,this anime recounts the tale of the battle for king every 1 000 years 100 children are sent to earth to fight to determine who will be their next king in the original japanese the creatures are which literally means magic evil object each is paired with a human partner and given a magic the human can use this book to unleash incredible powers in the and when a is defeated their is engulfed in flames alternately a book can be captured and burned directly after that the returns to the world br br the titular character is gash in japan a 6 year old with electric powers he is paired with and 14 year old genius is initially reluctant to fight but learning that some are evil and deciding the battle for king is wrong he decided to fight to become a 'kind king' br br bell has drawn comparison to pokemon but a better comparison is to digimon like digimon the and human have a one to one symbiotic relationship also unlike pokemon both shows have an actual plot br br bell features character growth and evolving relationships and some fairly adult story lines like love vs racism slavery mind control etc it even has some decent plot twists and mysteries,1
3292,please let me know of any versions of precious bane or gone to earth on video that people may be aware of i love the books of mary webb wholeheartedly and would be very grateful to have any information on either vhs or dvd br br i've read precious bane and gone to earth which are my favorites by mary webb many times and have collected other novels by her also i was lucky to have found her springs of joy poetry and essays but i've never been able to see the precious bane version that was on masterpiece theatre or the full version of gone to earth although there was an american movie classic airing of the wild heart which was a chopped up version of gone to earth's original film br br if anyone can assist me in obtaining copies of either or both of these films full versions i would be so thankful,1
3293,i saw this movie with my mother and i loved it it was such a sweet story not to mention funny because of the supporting cast they never make movies like this ever my favorite part is when grace minnie driver finds out about her boyfriend's wife's death and that she has the deceased wife's heart and she screams what was god thinking i do believe everyone no matter who you believe in has thoughts like that once in awhile but while it's very sappy it just might make you believe in true love and destiny for once and for all sigh br br the comedic timing between bonnie hunt and jim belushi will just make you crack up especially in the aforementioned scene it's terrible and yet so funny they make a good pair and i hope to see them again in something soon 10 10 stars,1
3294,this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it all the characters are decent i guess but the story is so so however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together and it was very boring a lot of times however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining and had some good stunts i have not yet seen the hong kong version however i'm sure it's better then this dud plus the twist is very predictable it's really lifeless and bland and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable the opening is supposed to be memorable but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it plus i really didn't root for any of the characters this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans the direction is terrible james glickenhaus does a terrible job here with extremely bland camera work bad angles and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout the acting is so so jackie chan is amazing as always however he is not his usual energetic self and looks bored and ps ed off throughout the film had zero chemistry with danny aiello and i really don't blame him either jackie rules danny aiello is ok here as jackie's partner but his character is a bit of an ass and he had zero chemistry with jackie he did ok i guess roy is decent as the main villain but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing he still is damn cool though rest of the cast are average at best overall not worth your time or money 1 2 out of 5,0
3295,this is the worst movie of all time no doubt and schindler's list did in fact have more laughs this not only tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great sl is considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh i wish i could meet yahoo serious so i could personally throttle him for this and all the other very very very bad movies he's ever been in there is also very few things to say about australia seeing as they like this stupid fruit don't get me wrong people mel gibson from australia are great they brought us mad max it makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage a review i just read said it was very funny sickening isn't it i personally will be this movie and will start a petition online to ban and burn all yahoo serious' movies for being so and i emphasize this so retarded br br these are just my personal thoughts no doubting they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie br br note if you are forced to watch this movie clockwork orange style call me to commit euthanasia on you for free,0
3296,i've never seen a bollywood film before but i caught the first ten minutes of this laughed myself silly and hit the r button on sky i'm glad i did i hope i don't insult anybody because basically the bf and i loved it but we couldn't take it half as seriously as the actors did especially the obsessed one who i understand is a huge bollywood star because we've seen him on the cover of lots of dvds since and i even saw a doll of him today in the bf keeps on about this bloke i am beginning to think he's obsessed he keeps saying that it's strange for the traditionally good looking one to be the anti hero of a film but then we do like films that aren't your stock predictable hollywood fare br br it was completely over the top but really good fun if all bollywood films are like this then we're watching more i have had that bloomin' song in my head all week and i can't speak a word of hindi ps any recommendations would be appreciated,1
3297,this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while it's not funny at all it simply portrays a lower class northern british setting i find it a very sad film at parts at others cuts are where they shouldn't be one thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie i only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end br br this movie completely loses the attention of the audience it's main problem is that it makes multiple reasons for one action which in turn tends to weaken that action however if there is one reason for one action it makes it more passionate all in all this movie is all over the place i didn't learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the shifting plot lines and stories where as i would have maybe enjoyed exploring the life of one character br br for example at the beginning when the guy meets god in the bar god seems like a cool guy the movie could've elaborated on that moment and i think it would've been a lot funnier br br anyway enough if's watch it if you want but i'm warning you this film is crap i respect the makers for trying to pull it off with such a low budget but they could've done a much better job i guess it all lies in the camera movement and editing the acting was decent but then again that's just my opinion,0
3298,what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog cheap sets and bad acting you would have galaxina br br this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek unfortunately it also led to some bad movies and this was obviously one of them i say obviously because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago i missed it when it came out in 1980 br br here's the underlying problem dorothy stratton couldn't act so for most of the movie they didn't even let her try i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status but for the life of me i can't understand why br br clearly the movie tried to spoof star wars star trek and aliens but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something it has to be funny this movie wasn't or at least the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't science fiction is ripe for parody as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved this movie however did it poorly,0
3299,i saw this film at a special screening at first i thought the movie would be like a typical amanda bynes movie but i was wrong the movie is based on the shakespeares book the night this movie tells the story of a girl who lives to play soccer well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at a different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school on her way she gets caught up in a long tangled web of love lies and deception this movie is this years mean girls i think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie,1
3300,i own a vacation lake home not far from wi ten minutes from the gein property to be exact i've seen his land the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging and i've shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the worden family while visiting relatives in california we decided to rent this movie it was disgusting the true story of ed gein is so disturbing and creepy why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me the actor playing ed is a very large man ed was a very small meek and shy man that is part of what makes his story so frightening he did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it you won't break much of a sweat digging a hole they didn't have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler just do your research and if the writing wasn't bad enough there are no mountains in wisconsin and i'm pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957,0
3301,probably the worst creature feature ever boa vs python was a million times better then this that wasn't great either bad acting bad effects guess what the dvd is one of those one with 3 hours of previews before the main menu probably the least scary movie ever no blood or violence people are stupid and keep using pistols when they have no affect on these animals the only cool part was the radioactive leeches that was pretty cool i name of the island is just a rip off of jurassic park boring tiring not worth even looking at but i suppose the characters stupidity is pretty funny so it would make a good comedy film but definitely not a thriller,0
3302,this is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in florida and the court case that follows what this film shows is how corrupt the american police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife the star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along fascinating stuff 7 out of 10,1
3303,fred carpenter screened eddie monroe at boston college and judging from the enthusiastic response he has much to be pleased about a taught well done indy impressive for it's big budget look and feel this movie has it all a tight script that grabs you and doesn't let go right up to it's surprise ending this viewer didn't see it coming excellent performances all around craig morris and jessica were were especially well cast in the leads delivering strong performances and kudos to frank and alex corrado for creating two detectives as engaging and interesting to watch as any in film i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it confirmed my belief that some of the best work in film will be coming from the independents and fred carpenter looks to be one of the best,1
3304,very good film very good documentary br br very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted narcissistic heartless their one eyed parents community and environment raised them as br br i tip my lid to pat can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation we need his integrity endurance intelligence clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business br br all the animals come out at night whores skunk pussies queens fairies junkies sick venal someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets pat should be the first drops of that real rain the people who control this earth are animals they need to be drowned br br i'm just in shock walking the night is scary business the inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives in murder on a sunday morning in pat blazing spotlight they look horribly caught horribly guilty and ready for a just and horrible drowning br br it is exceptionally satisfying in a world in which the punters play a rigged game to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are br br how does it feel you abominable snaky fingers of the law how does it feel to have your rigged prosecution your rigged confession your rigged detective work found out for what it really was how does it feel br br i hope it twists like a knife you miserable one eyed nothings,1
3305,to experience head you really need to understand where the monkees were when they filmed it br br this was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up their inventive and comedic series sort of an american idol of their day took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured around them br br this is their take on their manufactured image and status as the 2nd tier beatles they always felt they were in a box trapped and unable to find credibility despite their talents br br it is also a hell of a musical trippy inventive i have the soundtrack and full of surprises br br see it with an open mind,1
3306,this was it i would have never expected the ending if i didn't already know the behind the scenes stuff br br the one thing that i hated was that why was shannon kicked off and not alyssa i hate her i would rather her character die that what was funny is that in the scene where piper is dieing on the hospital bed and was crying by her side i started crying too lol at the time that this aired i was about and my favorite character was piper from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore lol br br then the whole go back in time thing was a shocker and really good i also blame pheobe for death because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a slutty bi and be with her good for nothing demon boyfriend br br but i think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a classic br br forever charmed blessed be,1
3307,it takes a while to get adjusted to the sound of sons of the pioneers but then you thoroughly enjoy it if the soundtrack would be played by an orchestra like max steiner or tiomkin it would lose its folkloric character the music conducts the film everything seems to follow its rhythm the whole cast is excellent ben johnson and harry carey jr are the young men guiding the caravan ward bond is the mormon leader and joanne dru is a flirting actress ford was able to make of what would be an ordinary western something totally different and original showing us the music the dances and most of all the people,1
3308,i had the pleasure of seeing live before seeing the video version of the show while nothing can compare to actually being there the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor the feel the sensation and so much more the wonderful performances of stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout the video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself a wonderful experience,1
3309,first off mexican werewolf in texas' title is misleading as many others have pointed out it is actually about el which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the same br br the production and editing just plain suck when it was over i probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the looked like for whenever it was in a scene despite one or two exceptions the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster's face clearly the special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror movie br br along with the terrible production comes the bad actors now a couple give fairly plausible performances erika fay and martine hughes but then there were the bad actors everybody else who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died then there's the absolutely terrible actor sara who gives one of the 2 worst performances i've ever seen in a movie i mean my god she was indescribably bad br br the plot was very simple basically a is in a small texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it however even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to leak through br br anyways horrible movie however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this probably the 2nd worst movie i've ever seen 1 10 awful,0
3310,one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film unfortunately the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process oddly and without any discernible reason the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me so sending this one guy away just seemed silly but that's the plot later when this man comes home betrayals and scheming have occurred leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non stop killing br br if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot then you should probably skip this movie as its practically non stop action and practically no plot or character development even when compared to other martial arts films i would estimate that 80 90 of the film are fight scenes endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives again and again and again fight scenes if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed kicked and slashed then this is the film for you the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest deep it ain't but if you want to see excitement and action only then this film is for you br br by the way this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end and when they finally do the logical thing it's too late and the effort is really really lame logical errors like this and the lady's suicide why make this a turn off your brain type of film,0
3311,one of the most poetic narrative films ever made is nonetheless a difficult film to immediately like i love this movie but i recommend seeing some of john ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one the first time i saw it i was 18 years old and i hadn't seen too many other westerns and i hated it i thought it was incredibly boring i kept waiting for something to happen it took several years for me to love this picture first i fell in love with westerns in general the traditions characters landscapes ways of talking etc and that made me realize when i saw again that a lot is happening in it after all br br i also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling and to listen to what each image was telling me is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career br br the movie is a celebration of a way of life and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other ford westerns actually that's not really as accurate as saying that rather it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns the other westerns have exterior action and interior emotion it quite beautifully places its mormon pioneers in the context of nature there are many shots of animals and children not for any surface narrative purpose but for illustrating this idea that is why the movie can be called a poem it isn't about the surface story which barely exists nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea and it gets this idea across through composition editing sound and music in fact one could argue that this is a purer form of filmmaking because the images directly express the emotional idea of the film rather than having to first service a story br br give this movie a chance and allow it to exist on its own terms not the terms of other westerns or other movies,1
3312,i ran across yvette in a film at the los angeles film festival and thought she was a doll after writing my review of her film there i wanted to see more of her found this movie it was pretty bad not her fault she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie bad directing scenes are looped over and over with all the actresses amber smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good i really like yvette but this was obviously a bad choice of hers i can't believe i rented this trash to look for her i hope to find her other movies,0
3313,i couldn't believe how bad this film was and trust me i was not expecting a masterpiece from a made for cable film i taped it just because i liked jane seymour i've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress so i just don't know what happened here the characters were shallow the dialog stilted the acting bad and yes that includes seymour it was nice seeing her play against type but not in something this bad i noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film and oh yeah they had barry bostwick playing the male lead 'nuff said,0
3314,its hard to decide where to begin i bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid iv ever wasted the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary this should have warned me but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go the movie is made up of three short stories each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point its never made clear what the significance of the bus is or what city its set in br br possible spoilers as if there is anything to be spoiled the first story is about a man who is persuaded by a car to it against his wife's wishes the car is sort of like a demonic and takes over his life br br the second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it br br the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency only to discover her date isnt all that normal br br inbetween these we are treated to shots of the bus or a bus anyway while a narrator on a load of garbage about relationships really its like he is on commission for saying br br the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever the acting the costumes and the little are all disgusting there arent even any attractive female cast members to admire simply put this movie is a debacle,0
3315,most of the brigitte bardot movies i've seen have failed to take full advantage of her captivating screen presence unfortunately she was given few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality which was a real oversight she deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way as genevieve in love on a pillow we had a clear exception to the trend of light fluffy vehicles for it was an interesting artistic film by any reasonable measure and in it a 28 year old bb was at her most alluring une parisienne is another featuring an extremely captivating brigitte in an interesting well crafted comedy that explores how an ambitious lady's man can be convinced to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife there are several good performances here her playboy husband michel is one the prince played by charles boyer is another with entertaining efforts by a good supporting cast as for brigitte bardot the way she looks in this movie is the way i remember her as a kid in the fifties she was 23 in 1957 and way ahead of her time more beautiful than any other actress of the period including marilyn monroe her curvy coquettish sexuality amply displayed in several bosom baring skintight dresses simply jumps off the screen she was more hip and cute than the women of america are today nearly fifty years later obsessed with their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics they come off like a bunch of clueless lesbians in stark contrast the sex kitten was sexually liberated intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable yet while fully understanding the power of her exceptional femininity she used it for a higher purpose than mere self interest she believed in love a still photo simply could not do her justice you had to watch her slender yet voluptuous form with its 20 inch waist lightly cross a room you had to see that wild blonde mane gaze into her big brown seductive eyes and listen as her full pouting lips spoke french in a closeup at the end of this movie she winks and flirts with the camera her beautiful orbs twinkling what a babe for fans of brigitte bardot une parisienne is not to be missed,1
3316,one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex while it is not a literal biography schrader his co screenwriter leonard his brother have taken several incidents from his life including his and crafted what can best be described as incidental tableaus that are visually sparse and stunning homosexuality is almost not there due to legal threats from his widow but in spite of this the film is still terrific and one of the best films i saw in 1985 i should also mention the important contribution of philip glass who did the score which adds an additional texture to the film and is superior to the one he did for scorsese's also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar hopefully this film will soon be available on dvd,1
3317,the third film from the polish brothers is their best most beautiful imaginative film yet though many audiences will have a problem with lack of traditional dramatic structure stick with it jack the plot is difficult to summarize so just know that the story includes agents trying to evacuate a city god in a cowboy hat the selling of angel wings and a sick orphan but it all works m david extraordinary photography makes almost every frame exciting and wonderful to look at the performances of the actors working with the polish brothers' offbeat script are pitch perfect and give the film its emotional punch the strong willed audience member will be moved by the mythology and folk tale of the story the comic and moving actors and finally the incredible courage and command that michael polish shows behind the camera again all of these incredible and seemingly disjointed elements come together magnificently in one of the most incredible things you should run out and experience a great great great movie,1
3318,fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1 br br at first he goes to boot camp where he has to learn how to handle his rifle and how to walk in line that's a really funny scene as the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight br br next thing you know he's in france in a trench hilarious scenes here include a starving charlie eating the cheese of a mousetrap and reading a letter from home over someone's shoulder br br when charlie goes to sleep he finds his bunker all flooded and his roommate snoring this is such a funny part i can't really describe it just watch the movie when charlie wakes up his legs feel numb so he tries to 'wake them up' it had me rolling on the floor when it turns out his second leg still feels numb while charlie actually rubs his foot br br the movie then turns a bit grim as charlie shoots a couple of germans from his trench although it's done in a very funny way and him as a tree to get close to the enemy saving a friend of his from a death squad br br last part is him getting a french girl in trouble by hiding in her house he then has to save her and while doing so he captures the german kaiser as well to do so he impersonates a german or something i love it when charlie is asked something in german and he's like the soldier looks at him in a funny way so charlie changes his mind ja ja ja the kaiser gets captured and charlie is the hero but then he wakes up again in it was just a sweet dream br br charlie did one of those 'dream before the bank comes to mind but who cares this movie was so funny it had me laughing all the way chaplin also has something to say with this movie as his later work became more of a social comment to several mishaps in the world and is explained best in the last sentence of the movie 'peace on earth good will to all mankind ' br br in short a charlie classic very funny timeless 9 10,1
3319,this movie was in one word terrible first of all the people who invented that thingie that puts you in the tv are slightly insane secondly the three teens are so obsessed with the show it's scary the movie was stupid and no effort or thought was put into it,0
3320,it's not as good as the movie that said it's a cute kids show okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie earth kitt who has been in numerous films but i'm sure many people know as catwoman and patrick sorry if i misspelled who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the tick it's really a rare and wonderful combination if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo to sum up entertaining children's show with plenty of inside jokes for the grown ups to laugh along with if your looking for educational value this isn't your show if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick,1
3321,when i was in 7th grade back in 1977 i was asked to read the novel that this was based on as part of my english class studies i can remember being very touched by it and excited when a tv version came out a year later br br kristy was a popular tv actress when this film was produced and was already playing a daughter in a dysfunctional family on the hit tv series family it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part i recall her as being a bit stiff at times but over all she does a good job she carries the movie well br br esther rolle is fantastic as the domestic who appears to be the only one in the household that seems to truly care for her barbara barrie as the somewhat frightened and slightly neurotic mother is also good as is young robin lively who would eventually appear as the black widow lana milford in twin peaks as the sweet younger sister who seems to be the focus of the parent's affection bruce davidson is also appropriately appealing as the german soldier of the title br br the best performance however belongs to michael constantine it is truly powerful and merited more recognition than it got at the time the bitterness and coldness he expresses makes the scenes in which he appears difficult to watch but makes it much easier to understand the quiet desperation of the rejected daughter constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations br br the film differs from the book only in some small ways it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd br br,1
3322,how important is the director anyway in this film made in the politically tumultuous times of the late 60s where questions of social organization were prime conflicts asks that question by making a movie that turns the camera away from the action and only begs to reveal the director william greaves it is an important work as it shows like no other movie shows the difficulties in blocking organizing and setting the scene it reveals the role of the crew something most directors frankly would like to disappear completely and that the invisibility of is essential for suspending disbelief and it also puts into consideration the role of performance and scripting and how they match don't match reality and what that has to say about how the director ultimately influences reality if at all br br the documentary or pseudo documentary or fictional narrative whichever you prefer via your interpretations of the themes has its brain in the over educated over intellectual crew its guts in the lost performers struggling to understand the vague and ambiguous directions and its heart in the director who stands in as the desire to portray to represent to express without any idea how to do any of those things or why he wants to do it it's a film that purposefully repeats banalities just to see if they can become more than banalities it's a film that sometimes shows the multiple shots simultaneously just to leave the editing to the audience and also reveal how disturbingly different shots change perspective br br it's an important work and something that everyone interested in the industry and process of film making should watch and understand it like many experimental films has no real mass audience appeal it's not for them it's for the industry and its for the 60s asking what to do with a group effort medium that still relies on a single voice and author br br polarisdib,1
3323,i have recently watched this film and have decided to comment on it br br the best way to watch this film is to not expect what you have seen in the past by miyazaki miyazaki is well known for his work on on spirited away and howl's moving castle well for western viewers anyway both of them films were kind of similar to each other but at the same time completely different however is a whole different type of story and animation all together br br the story follows a fish that has the face a girl after runs away from her home at the bottom of the sea she find a whole new world she never knew was out there and new trouble as well when she almost caught by a fishing boat she was rescued by a five year old boy known as br br the story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish can really stay with forever br br i feel the movie was inspired by the little mermaid and at the same time similar to no totoro br br the movie is very short and you have very little time to learn about the characters in this movie but the characters a fish and a little boy so how much are you expecting to learn about them the film is set over about what seems to be 3 days i think this is why the movie is so short br br i really enjoyed watching this movie and i hope you all enjoy this movie as well,1
3324,the palestinian situation is fertile and as yet largely fallow soil for film making 'divine intervention' tries hard and gives us an insightful peek into the almost surreal life of those caught up in the troubles but the film amounts to little more than a handful of admittedly lovely visual jokes thrown onto celluloid while the links between them become increasingly obscure as the film progresses a missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical issue,0
3325,this is a cheap o movie made by al adamson a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever even possibly worse than ed wood jr adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves hell's bloody devils satan's sadists and lash of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare his movies all had rotten production values sensations gore and amateur acting br br here in brain of blood several stock adamson actors such as his wife regina carrol and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamson's previous film dracula versus frankenstein this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good sure the makeup is laughable the plot dumb it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme and acting is level z but it's still better than their last film br br about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual part with more dialog and a more important role in the plot and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times as for ms carrol she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick however it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light,0
3326,i am the sort of person who never ever watches animated movies but i make an exception for and the swan princess being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it i finished the movie and all i can think is the horror i wanted to like it i really did i tried very very hard to like it but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film br br i am going to try repress the memory of this movie because it almost destroyed the first one for me there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third br br do yourself and favor and don't waste your time,0
3327,i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws example the background car sounds audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog's car production shows a total lack of imagination example slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part completely unnecessary to the plot to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting this film was released in 1982 not 1987 as the imdb database indicates and then current high tech was an amber screen on a 4 8 ibm pc with floppy drives maybe the pc was the real star of the movie at least it was interesting br br we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart as the other reviewer notes we paid too much,0
3328,on the scale of 1 to 10 i gave this a 4 i thought the film was not very good with too much violence and not one character to like br br on an erotic scale i give this a 6 many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness i always enjoy nudity and nancy travis and faye grant come through but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic,0
3329,i can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie i wonder why maybe because of the book i have to admit it really doesn't follow the book for sure the book by dean koontz is much better but the movie is also good as well it has the suspense the acting are good especially michael ironside whom have given a superb acting in this movie br br come one give this movie a chance there are still lot more worse movie than this like sum of all fears phantoms the da vinci code this are some of the worse movie i have seen really boring if compared to watchers which really have great elements in the movie this movie contains great suspense and non stop action i'm looking for this movie but it is really hard to be found on dvd br br by da way i really recommended this movie to everybody watch it you will never regret br br 10 10,1
3330,this film is worthwhile despite what you may hear the performance of marie dressler i hope i am spelling it right as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film it is an amazing performance she is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice you can actually smell the alcohol when she is done amazing and greta of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great the eugene o'neill story is solid and like most o'neill stories very deep and intense this is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30's and 40's you will like it some of the film is technically fuzzy but all in all worthwhile,1
3331,it seems like people are attracted to shows that showcase pathetic lives that have no purpose what so ever to me i give my sincerity to nbc for their dire efforts to make new changes in television making laugh track free shows they seem to always find big success like the office when i first started to watch it seemed to me that it could have potential to be a smash hit but after a couple of episodes i really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people showcased in these lowlife poor disgraceful areas and the end where they show earl and the brother in bed together it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life like street beggars or people who struggle to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like i just seem to always be disgusted when i watch the filth the people in this show live in it's like venice beach in california beautiful but so many hobos believe me i'm no rich guy middle class and not a clean freak either a bit sloppy but it just seems to me that the show just can't seem to get off of all the gruesome schmuck people out there who have one leg i just wish that they would show a little more class not all filth and poorness and trailers and just below average life it just seems to depress me to me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life what not to be it also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of smarts this is a schmuck u,0
3332,what can i say this was one awful movie to watch i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general due to the fact that most are usually low budget but this really pushed me up the wall i mean is this was has happened to gay cinema haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee's films just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters but that never happened most of the characters performances were just not very convincing it was like watching one of those badly produced made for tv movie specials on a local access tv stations i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of tori other works and the directors last work on latter day saints it was definitely not worth the wait definitely a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on dvd,0
3333,when i first heard that jack black and kyle gass would make a movie about their band i was freaking out i love their music and i hoped that this movie would be really funny now that i have watched it i can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but i think i expected more the movie is full of tenacious d's great music and i really loved listening to all of it there are a lot of great jokes and i just love the story at least the first bit i don't like the way the movie ends the ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more br br overall i think it is a good movie to watch everyone who likes rock music should watch it it'll give you a good laugh,1

3335,nero as the title of the movie is in germany is a another attempt to show one of the most interesting roman lucius better known as nero although this attempt at least tried to show a more historic accurate nero than the amusing but completely fictitious nero peter ustinov played in quo vadis it still is a major failure and to those imdb commentators who still believe that and propaganda is true please read a book about nero that was published less than 20 years ago nero did not burn rome this is proved he did not murder he did not torture kill and for pleasure he was the first emperor who banned the gladiator fights the movie still shows a lot of mistakes errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing the palace looking like some villa the city itself looked like well like a cheap set the acting was between good and sub par the music nearly insignificant and the movie soon deteriorated after nero became emperor to a rushed bad edited mess without any clear narrative structure so there still is the potential for an epic biography of nero that shows the true nero who was one of the best who ruled rome despite the lies of et al,0
3336,sex is comedy though not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot concentrates effectively on the relationship between film director and crew during the process of film making whilst successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes director features prominently throughout for it is she who carries the plot forward in the place of a narrator and gives us numerous little pearls of wisdom to think about she is a social commentator relating to her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead by way of associating him with a masculine stereotype their ambiguous relationship typifies something about human nature  the tendency to be fickle on one hand the two seem close when he is not in sight she claims to hate him jeanne also addresses his masculine pride perhaps in a feminist take on things br br the taboo of what constitutes obscenity is raised the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful because it is fakeness which constitutes obscenity that is the director's justification this is however doubly ironic for the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct br br there's more to this film than just relationships of course watching this film is not simply a question of analysing it for the sake of drawing out some sort of meaning one can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie this makes it realistic and believable a static camera is sometimes used taking in a heavy composition and at times the camera appears shaky like a home movie if you're looking for something fun to watch on a sunday afternoon that isn't too heavy but still leaves you thinking this is it,1
3337,i'm not sure as to call this movie a children's drama or a fantasy film when i first watched this i couldn't really make out the ending and that's the only part of movie that's seemed to lack depth and left me a bit depressed for awhile then i watched it a second time and realised how great the acting was and was clueless as to why it received the meager attention it did at the time br br unforgettable performances by the young and wood should have made this film a classic br br although the it was probably intended to be a fantasy drama by the original writer director evans once donner took over he presumably made it with a more dramatical outlook especially the ending which left a lot to be desired as to what really happened to bobby was he killed did he escape really do all those fantastic journeys or was it just an imaginary story woven by hanks to prove a point to the kids br br but in all it didn't provide the closure of a happy ending that we are so used to in a children's film perhaps it's because it's not just that br br to see what may have been a more classical ending check out the official elijah wood site where you'll find the first rough draft script of the conclusion of the movie presumably by the original writer br br also a note of the music by hans zimmer which is one the best soundtracks i've ever heard a mixture of childish and dark sentiments throughout the movie a great cd to get hold of if you can br br,1
3338,let me first state that i rarely review movies i only comment if i'm blown away or disappointed in something that i thought was going to be good killshot was a major disappointment on so many levels the script was horrible the acting was sub par coming from heavy weights like rourke and lane and the editing and effects were comical blowing up cars etc etc rosario dawson had a horrible role i can't believe would even accept it it was such a misuse of her talent i can't even put into words i should have know after i saw the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the that their was a serious problem with this film b movie all the way don't bother unless your really bored,0
3339,this film was a new direction for natalie portman a much more adult role though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself ann portman and susan sarandon who plays her newly divorced mother adele travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to beverly hills there these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as portman's character grows up unknowingly at first to adele she grows up and becomes a better mother for it br br ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress or so she thinks adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives we see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone having left their old lives behind br br the acting is top notch from both of them they seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes you can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie br br though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films the fact that the acting is well done and the story isn't too flawed let's me recommend it br br i will say however it will probably go away soon i don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge christmas season of movies starting in a week or so see it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses,1
3340,i really liked this quirky movie the characters are not the bland beautiful people that show up in so many movies and on tv it has a realistic edge with a captivating story line the main title sequence alone makes this movie fun to watch,0
3341,it's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of murder mcgee after mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an board the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one sound familiar it's supposed to it's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline excessive violence gratuitous nudity zero budget br br can't get enough it's pure entertainment i enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror cliché's but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time there is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though good acting the entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks recent or otherwise there was a lot of chemistry between the characters i was very entertained throughout the entire film and i am fully convinced the writer director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers the script was very well written and the dialogue flowed naturally br br the effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically no budget i already know this going in this film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy although this is not an oscar award winning opus it never claims to be and props to that it's a lot of fun if you like slashers you'll really appreciate this film if you like blood and boobies you'll appreciate it also,1
3342,br br well known comedians meekly admit they wish they could do real satire like bill hicks inbetween these pitiful testimonies we are treated to what an exceptionally talented comedian can achieve when he could otherwise be chasing fame and fortune he didn't get his own talk show but at least he was no one's puppet,1
3343,maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's there's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now br br the real curio here and really the only reason to watch this movie is the appearance of kristine debell as alice she was a ford model and it shows she's got classic wasp ish good looks like a really cute ivy league sorority girl so what the hell is she doing in this cheap cheesy skin flick from my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie which might explain it and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part when she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin' julie andrews or something i just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something instead of the near career killer that it was anyway she is damn cute and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen much less do a masturbation scene a couple of oral sex scenes with men and women and then do the real deal as a climax to the film it is also definitely not a body double at all that is our little kristine taking one for the team or for the greater glory of showbiz or something it's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating ahem but in a way i kinda wish she hadn't done it that was a very pretty talented young girl getting some really bad advice br br anyway my guess is that kristine debell wherever she is has long long since wished this movie would go away she was very cute and appealing in meatballs almost impossible to believe this is the same girl but it is,0
3344,jamie foxx did an incredible job playing ray charles i loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie when ray charles was little he went blind and his mother didn't baby him she was a strong woman who didn't treat him any different because he was blind she made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life his mother also sent him to school as well then when ray charles became a man he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics sex and betrayal when i am discouraged about something i can just think of this movie and it will inspire me,1
3345,beyond the clouds is an over the top artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a man woman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers there's little meat on the bones of this fragmented work a taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four nonetheless beyond the clouds will be fodder for and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance,1
3346,although not the most technically advanced film i have seen this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours the main characters are sweet and you really get to like them and feel something when susie q has to go but feel good again when she returns as maggie br br lots of stock dialogue and a contrived plot line but most of all lots of fun,1

3348,jamie foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues soul country singer ray charles to the film's credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding charles' character and the choices he made both personally and professionally br br this is a slick looking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place not only does it look good it sounds good i only wish there was more music in here when it's inserted it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it br br assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true i was impressed and disappointed with charles meaning the story left some memorable impressions since i'm writing this 16 months after viewing it main impressions include br br good re living ray's immense talent and his foresight to step out and take chances musically such as going country for awhile the man had supreme confidence in himself but didn't come across as arrogant about it also memorable was showing him beating his heroin addiction with no help that's just amazing br br bad i also remember through this film how easily hooked ray got in the first place and disappointed he was so unfaithful to his wife a really sad comment was that his wife was more upset with him for missing his kid's little league games than she was for all the cheating he was doing on her even fathering a child with a member of his singing group br br the only negative i had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of his problems being blamed on one early childhood event the accidental death of his brother that tragedy was used as cop out for all ray's as an adult which is another example of a culture in which people refuse to take responsibility for their actions br br note there is an extended version with the dvd but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching so stick with the theatrical version,1
3349,i just recently discovered this fantastic series and i just can't seem to get enough of garner's laid back pi the shows continually display excellent level of writing and suspenseful episodes br br this episode of hand is a little different forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend br br the mystery is great and it's unraveling is convincing enough it's based on a book can't remember the name and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode garner excels here as rockford gets tough and really means business this has a noir feel to it all the way the dark lighting and overall mood echo the great dark thrillers of the 40's and 50's br br really good episode in a class a series easily deserves a 10,1
3350,the above summary really isn't meant as a slam against this film as the series followed a very similar format as usual simon templar the saint meets a lady in distress and comes to her aid he also comes to the aid of a police detective who was framed of accepting a bribe along the way he meets some interesting supporting characters this time paul as pearly gates and during his unraveling of this not especially compelling mystery none of them really are templar is extremely erudite and just plain cool george sanders is once again the consummate sophisticated british do gooder and he succeeds once again in making an excellent b detective series film nothing particularly special but a familiar and breezy product sure to please fans of the genre,1
3351,i'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established however watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix we can only assume he had a charlie's angels fixation at one time based on that reference we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie's angels run in 1979 or 1980 but from what i've read here it was made around 1987 you sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class and while by no means would i expect a low budget trash fest like this to be politically correct the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other even so i'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made second only to nail gun massacre,0
3352,needful things was one of my favorite stephen king books but this movie is one of the worst book to film adaptations i have ever seen they changed so many things around that it made me sick even the concept of the book being deception things not always what they appear reminder throughout the book was not shown in the movie althogh it was enjoyable as many stephen king films are but as many stephen king films this one did not follow the book and became a piece of hollywood trailer trash 2 10,0
3353,i don't play video games at all but my children do br br i got a big kick out of this would like to see more of this type of film very cool as my youngest would say br br interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting like i said i don't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change this visual concept was different which caught my eye plus the sound track was pretty good i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film who knows maybe i'll be a gamer someday,1
3354,i think this movie is underrated to me it felt like a gulp of fresh air some people complain about the implausibility of the plot overlong sequences and lack of sex the latter being i believe the main reason for implausibility and how come there are no drunken teenagers talking dirty but it's just not their thing and good for them if they can't relate to the story the performances are great i'd really like to see more of the actors in other movies the emotions are genuine the whole unrequited love thing is presented with uncanny subtlety and it does give you the tingly feeling you expect to get from a good movie,1
3355,based on the actual event this epic is set in the year 221 b c and tells the true story of the unification of china action packed and filled with intrigue passion betrayals and unforgettable battle sequences it held my attention throughout in spite of its 160 minute length br br the king ying played by li is obsessed with unifying the seven kingdoms of china and becoming its first emperor his lover lady zhao played by the beautiful actress gong li devises a plot whereby she will travel to the neighboring kingdom of yan to set a fake assassination plot in motion which will give the king an excuse to invade yan however she falls in love with the assassin as the king becomes more and more ruthless br br there are subplots and tragedy and constant high drama there are scenes of great beauty and of abject cruelty there is great cinematography and brilliant use of physical space br br the deep characterization made me think of shakespeare and tragic events that call to mind greek drama and yet it is totally chinese as it deals with age old questions of whether the ends justify the means and raises the questions dealing with life and death and good and evil and all the blurred edges in between br br it is the story of individuals against the backdrop of history a history that has shaped china for the past two thousand years i was swept up in the story as well as the moral questions raised there are no easy answers and this was one of the strengths of the movie br br recommended but be prepared for the violence and gore br br,1
3356,there is only one racist joke in this daffy duck short which is basically when daffy rides black beauty it is a black woman i can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn't even illegal to discriminate black people yet br br aside from this point a coy decoy is basically a fun interesting short where daffy meets characters in books and does things in books i liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here the way daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there the wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well blood thirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry i also liked the style of animation used and the theme of the episode br br for people who are totally into daffy duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy a coy decoy br br available on youtube,1

3358,farscape is the best sci fi show period for one main reason everything the show attempts it does very well from a technical aspect the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show the special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv the acting is also great too many shows nowadays use only the american market of actors for their shows remember the first time you saw the matrix and you said wow where did that agent smith come from its the same feeling that you get watching claudia black anthony virginia hey and especially wayne these aussies are great and it comes through in this great show br br the plot is second to none the next closest thing i can think of is babylon 5 during the shadow wars episodes but this tops even that its a real treat getting to watch all the episodes sequential again the intricacies of the interpersonal relationships of the characters are well scripted and performed the overall plot is both original and thoroughly entertaining i am always itching for the next show br br the comedic episodes are funny the drama episodes are touching and the action sequences are tense the beginning of the second season had some great comedic episodes which had me laughing aloud something that rarely happens while watching television that is not south park or seinfeld the drama is even harder whether crichton is meeting his mother or the characters face thier mortality all is done with heart and intensity lastly it goes without saying that the action is tops this is sci fi br br if you are a fan of science fiction in the slightest if you enjoy good television at all if you like good serialized plot you owe it to yourself to watch farscape br br oh and ben browder owns,1

3361,i saw this movie in september with my mother i was expecting a good movie and i saw an excellent one this is now my most treasured movie it did not leave me after i left the theater the situations in this movie reminded me of my late grandmother meryl streep and renee zellweger were equally incredible this movie has made me realize how important family relationships are rent it i can't recommend it enough,1
3362,an in name only sequel to john carpenter's vampires this movie takes place in thailand and involves a sect of bad vampires who enjoy killing people and a sect of good vampires who do not while it's an interesting idea to set a vampire film in thailand the writers don't seem to do a lot with the exotic locale this film could just as easily have been set in los angeles which brings me to my next point which is that this seems a lot like blade lite we've got the rock soundtrack the martial art battle scenes a dance club bloodletting and of course lots of sharp objects going through vampires what we don't have is the budget and talent yes the hero is a good martial arts fighter too bad his acting wasn't as good and there's plenty of decent wire work and tons of revved up fight sequences maybe too many the problem is they just don't have the same impact as the ones in any of the blade films perhaps it's just that the film has a been there seen that feel to it br br however for me the biggest problem was that the filmmakers didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the lead played by the buff and bland colin and his girlfriend she gets snatched at the very beginning of the flick after a whiny exchange with her boyfriend we have no vested interest in her welfare at this point and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her now that's a major drawback when that's the major thrust of the plot br br in the end you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this but i can think of a lot better things to do with your time like renting any of the blade movies,0
3363,with great expectations i went to see this film spain's contribution to the oscar race this year part from being completely pointless banal pathetic badly written edited acted and directed the movie is too long it fails in delivering the message it tries to give fails in its storytelling clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm there are some so extreme misfires i haven't seen in a movie in a long time the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head the divine revelations all that lizard nonsense the spanish speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience and some of the commentaries i overheard was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest,0
3364,all i can say is i really miss this show my wife i just got married around the time this show started up why did cbs take it off the air i think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy it made me laugh it also made me cry but when cbs took it off the air my wife i thought cbs made a big mistake you know what would be so great have a reunion show that would be so cool anybody know if it is on dvd yet on the last season of promised land did cbs show the whole last season i think cbs took it off the air at mid season my wife i will never forget it the opening with that theme song was fantastic this show only comes once in a life time may we never forget promised land,1
3365,i believe it has been over 40 years since i saw this series yet memory of it hasn't faded a bit this would be a natural for dvd re issue it seems to me many of the performers have gone on to greater fame robert hardy sean connery to name a couple though it was a role i still remember judy dench then in her 20's as katherine of france henry v she was very lovely then as now br br there is a hint on this site that the series was filmed in color is this so who of us would know virtually no color tv in those days mores the pity no vcr's if so some might have recorded it as a way of teaching english history this series made it come alive in ways few class room teachers can manage br br what a fine re issue this would be,1
3366,where this movie is faithful to burroughs' vision it is excellent where it departs from burroughs it is superb it is a tale of family of the seeking of a father by a real and emotional orphan lambert's speaking of one of the most anguished lines in all of cinema he was my father is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most cynical critic not a perfect motion picture the notorious over dubbing of mcdowell's voice by glenn close is unconscionable and only in terms of a very british error but a fine if flawed masterpiece and a noble farewell to sir ralph richardson,1
3367,i first seen this movie in the early 80s and we used to have it on betamax as we all know betamax went the way of the 8 tape sigh it really had nice picture quality too anyways i'm glad i found this movie again i've been searching for it for more than 10 years this movie falls into the category of movies like airplane continuous jokes oneliners funny actions mark blankfield is absolutely hilarious his transformation from the shy dr daniel jekyll into the sex crazed mr hyde is unforgettable complete with and the part i loved best was when he hijacked the car from this poor guy and then drove to madam woo woo's totally psychedelic experience without the drugs if you need laugh therapy this is the movie to do it when i first seen it i had tears in my eyes and my belly was hurting from constantly laughing this is a movie i could watch over and over again i highly recommend it,1

3369,this is an excellent b film horror movie that borders between horror and comedy it is about a genetically mutilated scorpion in outer space can it get more unreal it is a hybrid between alien and chain saw massacre the movie was shot in stockholm with a mixed cast of americans and swedes that interact beautifully director martin does a great job finding the comical highlights in this script and gets a few good laughs out of the audience the movie was shot with little or no money and it is inspiring to see what can be done with limited resources stinger has all qualities of a b film horror movie it is comical and scary at the same time and the cast and crew are dedicated to their cause it is great to see that movies like this can still be made i would recommend seeing it if you like this type of films,1

3373,leave ed wood alone to call plan 9 from outer space the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of hollywood guano its rightful title this pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical commentary actually does seem to be formed along the lines of plan 9 with badly staged scenes of down on their luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher budget epics but whereas plan 9 occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny the disgusting burlesque of groucho marx stealing manhattan from the indians to low camp hedy lamarr attempting to impersonate joan of arc hearing her voices to tedious dennis hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of napoleon to the unexpectedly poignant performance of peter lorre as the psychotic nero give the worst director trophy to irwin allen for turning so much into so little,0

3375,what can you say about a film that makes the erotic witch project look like the english patient again the plot and characters are secondary but the plot is almost an exact copy of br br four buxom sorority sisters and a goofy male guide enter a forest to look for the bare wench and the women become sexually charged the bare wench leaves porno devices and a blow up doll just like in they get lost the doofus gets lost and the girls find their way back to their hotel there they reenact the end of the blair witch project as cameras are dropped and the guide is seen playing a game integral to the thin plot br br at least three of the sorority sisters here have unnaturally large breasts full of dimples and stretch marks along with the rather obvious surgery scars the one natural gal here is humiliated by the director in a very unfunny and overlong end credit segment outtake scenes where she could not get a line right is played over and over again ad nauseum br br julie strain shows up in a fright wig to play the bare wench this one scene seems to be added later since no one could possibly be credited in the cast with shooting it in the background as the women cavort and stroke you can see someone's picket fence this may be director jim backyard br br this is just bad stuff the lesbian love scenes are kelvin degrees cooler than the erotic witch most of the lovin' consists of the four women mashing their eight collective breasts together i think they are trying to form a silicone based that would rescue them from this bad career decision no such luck if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then the makers of the blair witch project should be really really mad br br this is unrated and contains mild physical violence strong profanity female nudity sexual content and sexual references br br,0
3376,as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort god knows how funding was approved seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again the only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent one blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on and it will only last 25 minutes and you won't miss any of the plot br br no idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks,0
3377,i didn't personally know karen carpenter nor richard for that matter so i must go by how the movie portrayed her i think a better person to ask about it's accuracy would be her brother richard however from what i did see and learn of karen i felt her pain share her sadness and she was a very special person to me growing up i know that i wasn't born until 1965 so i didn't get to know her as much as some of you older fans but i definitely grew up listening to her music and i have fond memories of her music i remember the song about the radio every sha la la la every whoa so fine etc and i remember we've only just begun as a matter of fact i memorized many many of her songs and some people quite a few tell me that my voice sounds almost identical to her i am not joking on this i also used to be anorexic during high school and part of college 1978 1987 to be exact and weighed anywhere from 82 pounds to eventually 120 pounds in 1987 i developed some pretty serious health problems from that which helped me to identify with the actress portraying karen in the movie the mother agnes was very much like my mother in many ways and i could also feel the pain that karen must have experienced for my mother was often unfeeling critical and disapproving as agnes was if this was true to accuracy the movie was helpful in identifying and getting to know karen on a more personal note by not just hearing her music but by seeing what she was going through it is quite difficult to portray a person's entire life in 2 3 hours and recount every single detail perfectly so i would have to say that there is probably no biography that is that accurate i will give this story an 8 though i wish i did know karen personally i would have died to meet her i would have loved to have shook her hand given her a hug or talked to her i feel her warmth and love every time i hear one of her songs and she is greatly missed,1
3378,i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself and the actual boss's daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger ashton but this movie is so puerile i had to turn it off it was a waste of time to watch it when people started peeing all over the living room it was too much to watch painful awful crap movie if they had just toned it down a little are there really people out there that find it funny and like it i was relieved to know that imdb readers rated it so low the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor i liked that part also the opening scene with the coworkers on the train was cool as i like his characters if you can stomach non sense movies or you are pretty young then it might be one you can stomach,0
3379,there is a lot wrong with this film i will not lie i will say that most of the problems feel like they stem from a budget that was chopped out from underneath the flick and some bad hack job editing br br this is not office space do not go in expecting office space levels of comedy it is very funny though it is a mess but very funny at the same time a funny mess of a film in the way that caddyshack is funny a mess of unrelated funny scenes filled with some very annoying unfunny scenes br br it works as a whole though and it certainly deserves a wide release this is the best commentary on the wal mart starbucks mtv nation you could hope for the very fact that a film is exploring the idea that dumb people are breeding at an alarming rate while the intelligent people are not is great in my book not very politically correct but worth at least some debate,1
3380,sony pictures classics i'm looking at you sony's got the rights to harry records you need to distribute the film and you'll get radically increased sales of his back catalog anyhow this is a great study of a fascinating musician woefully full of great stories greater music and it could have been 3 hours longer and i'd have loved it even more saw it at the american mods rockers festival at the aero theatre in santa monica where it played to a packed house they were turning people away at the door i went to many of the mods rockers festival films and let me assure you that no other film came even close to selling out let alone turning people away see it in the theatre buy the dvd and make sure some slow on the uptake company cough sony cough picks it up asap,1
3381,amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat or a blouse are about the only stand out points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities they are never developed to any satisfying degree and exposition is almost non existent a large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multi storied clinic hospital the overall effect is bleak and sterile a la thx 1138,0
3382,this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to vacate the auditorium what an unmitigated bore a complete waste of 1 and a half hours when i die i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish,0

3385,good boring or bad it's good worth your money if you can spare it for a ticket sure better than the trailer makes it seem yes oddly br br there isn't much to the script guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires one of them is too honest to go along with it all and a well laid plan goes to hell br br this could have been a poorly executed reservoir dogs ripoff but the skill of the cast and the director's ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto a solid footing,1
3386,it might be a stretch saying this as a die hard carlin fan but the material both written and as performed in it's bad for ya is some of the best late era material yet at 70 carlin bounces back from the level of despair and some of the stumbles in the act itself from life is worth losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful or as much as the old f can get and is continuously ceaselessly funny and funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching back in town or the first time the material even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done i e the whole bit on children in school and camp like the children segment in diseased is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it the mind while here goes tickling the funny bone br br going from the topic of death how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book six weeks unless if on the computer the facets of communication looking down from heaven spots of god naturally kids and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have rights make up the bulk of the special centered around the premise that what's bad for you plain and simple is bs total complete bs which as we also learn or if you've really learned it you're like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off not quite randomly by the parent holds the country together carlin isn't necessarily angry though even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns even just to observe how horrifying children's teeth coming in look it's skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is not going to be fine br br what it comes down to is this carlin is to dirty witty cautionary stand up comedy what yoda is to jedis everywhere which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where it's pretty damn hard to get any at the least we get classic gc outrageous lines and bits from the man's 13th or is it 14th comedy special including as far as an eyebrow raising observation on people who play mozart music during a birth,1
3387,a poetic examination of the human condition performed without dialogue the anti hero the man builds a contraption to escape a band of marauders out of the of what was once a civilization to the ruins of the city to for his survival there he crosses with the brute brilliantly played by jean reno of the professional and mission impossible fame the man is rescued by a crazy old genius who lives in a fortress of his own design by using their wits the man and the old genius are able to keep the brute and his ilk at bay but they realise it is only a matter of time before their defenses are compromised so they make a break for it this is a strongly understated tale of the desparate struggle for life with excellent action scenes and clever humor of all of the movies of its kind like road warrior omega man and even ultimate warrior featuring yul as a buff knife fighter le dernier combat is the most artfully crafted copies of the video are hard to find i would give my left eye ball for one if your local art house ever has a revival of this film i heartily recommend that you break any engagement to able to be able to see it big,1

3389,this movie was an all around uninspiring film it was a non moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time while baby is sleeping watching this film br br i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it i was pretty much non impressed with everything about this film,0
3390,i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa because in germany you can't get it anywhere i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series because they were full of atmosphere br br i was glad when the movie finally arrived br br but after watching this cheesy movie i was very disappointed the actors i think you can't even say actors are boring and untalented the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy br br i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie,0
3391,imdb lists this movie as a comedy i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy tragedy maybe br br i won't say whether this is a good movie or not all i know is it is not a comedy i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chair br br this movie is not what is advertised it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to make people think i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know or even that i don't know it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever br br it made me think alright it made me think i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back br br i'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them br br i am not one of them,0
3392,less a thriller than an colorful adventure with suspenseful elements the man who knew too much should not be really be compared with such hitchcock masterpieces as vertigo rear window or psycho it is instead more akin to such enjoyable romps as to catch a thief and north by northwest shot largely on location in morocco and london the film tells the story of a married couple james stewart and doris day whose holiday is interrupted when they innocently run afoul of an assassination plot and when their young son is kidnapped in order to insure their silence br br james stewart and doris day are quite effective in their roles of the all american couple and the characters are given an unusual twist stewart a midwestern doctor is outgoing but has a touch of the ugly american abroad about his personality day who plays a popular stage and recording star who retired upon her marriage has a suspicious nature these qualities of personality and background play extremely well into the story br br the man who knew too much contains a number of famous scenes both the scene in which stewart drugs day before telling her of the kidnapping and the very complex albert hall sequence involving what seems hundreds of cuts are very powerful less often noticed although to my mind equally if not more satisfactory are the more subtle scenes in which hitchcock combines an edge of suspense along with perverse humor as when stewart attempts some detecting at a taxidermist shop and day belts out que sera sera written for this film in a most unsuitable way at an embassy cocktail party br br although the man who knew too much lacks the depth and impact of hitchcock's greater work it remains an enjoyable film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole it's hitchcock light but recommended br br gary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer,1
3393,the hand of death most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to due in no small part to john woo's masterful direction coupled with kat's superb cinematography some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art house film both james and sammo hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate is particularly good as the baddest of the bad it's a role reversal the likes of which i don't think i've ever seen before normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache i didn't even recognize him at first sammo's goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable in a villain you love to hate kind of way his choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic jackie chan appears briefly early on and late in the going as a blacksmith and i believe i actually glimpsed yuen biao somewhere along the way tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent,1
3394,in this offering one only has to view the current kennel club's annual offering to see the parallels outrageously funny and captures the true essence of the competition one can only imagine the wit of the producers and the amazing ability of the performers i too would have nominated this movie for a globe award and feel it is one of the funniest i have ever seen,1

3397,as roger corman has said in an interview low budget film making enables film makers to take chances on offbeat ideas well you'd be hard pressed to find a film that thrives on the offbeat as mightily as george barry's death bed the bed that eats br br the film does have a back story to it and it's an interesting one at that i'll forgo relaying any sort of details so you can hear them for yourself if you take a chance on watching it suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger consuming the unwary with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid br br death bed is an eerie haunting little flick that plays out its absurd premise in such a way that it transcends the usual assortment of schlock fare it occupies its particular dream world in such a way that it was possible for me to take it seriously it's a truly strange and unconventional horror flick it in exploitative ingredients there's some tasty dollops of female nudity and yet is also art albeit art with a completely skewed sensibility br br the special effects are not too bad for a film with a microscopic budget and barry gives the film a good and atmospheric midnight movie quality the acting from the cast is as uninspired as one could imagine although patrick spence thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas as the artist narrator and one definite point of interest is seeing one familiar face on hand future 'boy meets world' father william russ br br this film might not have even found the small cult following that it does have were it not for pirated copies making the rounds this certainly has to rank as one of the instances where such a practice ultimately ended up helping the film even if the exposure took years to take hold br br if you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items death bed may be just what you've got in mind br br 7 10,1
3398,great cult flick for mst 3k types richard boone is a mess bad hair arthritis even his dark glasses aren't right about as good as a bad dino flick can get actually that charging saber toothed was pretty cool maybe spielberg should take a couple of notes from that one,1
3399,this was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long there was an aspect of film noir contained in this movie and i am glad that nolan picked to film it in black and white the plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged even the dialogue was good along with the acting it reminded me of what was to come in memento by not being in chronological order i liked how the main character tried to use what cobb taught him for example saying everyone has a box which he put his personal things into also on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because christopher nolan would later direct batman begins and the dark knight two other great movies there is a great twist in the end which i'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it even though i kind of figured what would happen when cobb gave the young man d credit card i also liked how the writer had a copy of the republic by plato one of my favorite philosophical books this is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it plus it only being an hour long there is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which i thought was pretty brilliant,1
3400,the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as mediocre or poor in quality but it is a great movie br br too bad that the aristocats doesn't get the deserved credit i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics br br despite being extremely underrated it is one of the funniest disney classics it is full of hilarious some of them hysterical moments br br edgar the greedy butler is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief he's one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny br br every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you'll ever see especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge with the dogs chasing him that is hysterical br br but the classic humor doesn't just come from edgar or the hound dogs other characters have their moments as well br br about the quality subject it isn't perfect but remains on a high level even after walt disney's death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt's spirit and the aristocats is one of those examples they don't make them like this nowadays br br as usual legendary disney actors voice the characters in this case we have phil harris sterling holloway paul eva gabor and pat br br the characters are cool in general thomas duchess and her 3 kittens the mouse the alley cats the english geese the hound dogs and the horse the human characters are included as well the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide the comic old lawyer georges and edgar himself br br about the soundtrack it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas theme but i can't remember its name everybody wants to be a cat and the aristocats sung by maurice chevalier for example br br this movie takes place in paris france in the year of 1910 above all this is a joyful nice and very pleasant movie a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten but very worthy br br this should definitely be on top 250,1

3402,this is the 4th movie in the karate kid series however it has nothing to do with the previous 3 the only character remaining is mr this time around mr meets troubled teen julie pierce swank before she was famous julie having all kinds of problem including being bullied at school by a guy belonging to a pseudo military club on campus naturally she is trained how to fight anyway through julie learns karate and becomes a better person spiritually and learns how to respect herself and in the end regains her respect i like the unique idea of the antagonist being a female and having a male as her enemy i there are also some fight scenes which are done quite well very low key and minimal violence none of the fighting is graphic the ending is also good and a bit surprising it is predictable but not a typical ending for this kind of film the film has echoes of the original obviously especially the spiritual aspect and the lessons learned it is not as good as the 1st movie and certainly not as good as the 2nd it is however a giant leap forward compared to the underwhelming 3rd entry this is a very entertaining under dog movie that is suitable for the whole family 8 10,1
3403,glenn close is back as sarah plain and tall a woman who keeps a family together through the good and bad times the acting is superb christopher walken unusually non spooky as her husband once again delivers a top notch performance it's good to see young christopher bell all grown up too bad we don't get to see much of anna lexi randall also a few years older but the new addition to the family played by emily osment was very welcome and finally jack palance as the long lost patriarch is as fine as ever,1

3406,this first time writer director comes across as a season pro with two coyotes most action dramas are all about the action first then the story but this picture works the other way around if this is just the beginning for this director then hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star independent movie making has once again reached a new level,1

3408,joan cusack steals the show the premise is good the plot line interesting and the screenplay was ok a tad too simplistic in that a coming out story of a gay man was so positive when it is usually not quite so positive then again it is fiction all in all an entertaining romp br br one thing i noticed was the inside joke aspect since the target audience probably was straight they may not get the gay stuff in context with the story br br kevin kline showed a facet of his acting prowess that screenwriters sometimes don't take in consideration when suggesting kline for a part br br this one hit the mark,1
3409,if archie bunker was armed he may well have been joe however all in the family would have had a rather short run because the censors would never have allowed it to run along the lines of this movie joe is a working class guy who is a racist and a bigot and has a big mouth especially when he's drunk one night he meets a man in a bar bill who is having a drink to soothe his frazzled nerves after accidentally killing his daughter's junkie boyfriend and he lets that slip to joe what happens is that bill's daughter was living with the junkie and she's hauled off to the hospital after an overdose and he goes by the apartment to collect her things but doesn't expect that he'll actually run into the boyfriend who comes in fresh from a big drug deal in the struggle that ensues the boyfriend is killed accidentally and bill doesn't want anyone really to know of course but he lets it slip to joe and then when the newspapers and tv reports come out joe sees them puts 2 and 2 together and suddenly this man is a hero in his eyes he hooks up with him later and bill is of course concerned that joe is going to blackmail him but not for money he wants to hang out with him which is in a way almost worse now bill's daughter escapes from the clinic she's in and slips back home and accidentally overhears what happened and then is on the run and most of the rest of the movie consists of joe bill infiltrating the underground to try to find her this builds up to a rather shocking ending which to me was totally unexpected and ends on just the right note or wrong note depending on your point of view a sort of decent but dim view of life in the early 70's mostly from a working class point of view which makes it not for everyone but it's not a bad film at all and it's a decent watch 8 out of 10,1
3410,how did they get that cinematic shot of the car colliding with the back end of the semi and then roy sits up great looks like the dvd is scheduled for may of 2006 about time watch this on a large screen or film revival in a theater if possible in order to fully appreciate the full aspect ratio my other favorites in this category are original italian job with michael caine bullit with steve mcqueen to live and die in la with the csi guy when he was young french connection with gene hackman ronin with robert deniro vanishing point with barry newman enemy of the state with hackman again what are your favorites,1
3411,if you find the first 30 minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why you're watching it don't give up also hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans who don't see and hear a lot of danish films anyway as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his her patience br br being a fan of the movie out of africa this film piqued my interest because it's based on a short novel by karen the major character in that film br br the meal babette's feast was amazing i'm no chef but i was impressed how one interprets the story too varies i suppose depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religion wise if the latter how you look at the definition of can affect how you interpret this story br br in any case it's a fine film but don't watch this if you're dieting,1
3412,i though this film was okay i din't think it was great it was a bit too slow for my taste lots of drama but not very much action until close to the end of the film this movie was basically a dramatic film with the payoff if you can call it that not until near the end to me the scenes of the dam bursting and the water flooding the town were okay but much too brief the film itself is done okay the acting is decent but it just didn't do it for me in the long run think it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built through the whole movie at least that's what i think the other factor is that i had just recently watched '10 5' and its sequel '10 5 these are 2 big budget event movies which in my opinion are a very hard act to follow in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction as a result i have to rate killer flood the day the damn broke at 4 10,0
3413,if you are an insomniac and you cant get anything to get you to sleep i definitely recommend this movie if you are renting it for whatever other reason dont this movie is by far one of the most slow moving turtle motivated movies i have ever seen the only reason i rented it was because my brother wanted to for some odd and strange reason i cant even write about this movie anymore get it away from me,0
3414,this film was hilarious it provided a somewhat comical view of the british club scene which if you really look at it is a funny thing the characters in this flick were so realistic to those of us who watched here at my place that it was like watching a movie about ourselves br br there were a few pivotal scenes which really made this movie work the getting ready scenes the get me a real doctor scene the white background scene showing each character in a total state of being wrecked ending with the infamous line what was i saying and the comedown sunup scenes i have lived these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my own ridiculous behaviour br br i can't give this movie a 10 because it doesn't measure up to groove which i thought was out of this world but it certainly has its moments the mise en scene and the camera work is superb the special effects are well worth mentioning and the acting is fantastic br br after waiting a long time to see this film i am glad to say that i was not disappointed i hope to see more from the writer director in the future,1
3415,this has got to be one of the best episodes of doctor who that i've seen since it came back last year there is a brilliant mix of amusement fear and tenderness all mixed up which equals one amazing episode the ood were brilliantly designed and i'm pretty sure there' going to be a lot of ood jokes in the next few weeks i myself am guilty of that already i particularly liked the way that we saw a different perspective of rose's and the doctor's relationship and the ending well it's the first time i have ever hidden behind a cushion i cannot wait until next weeks episode to find how they get out of this mess,1
3416,to put it simply this was a pompous piece of canine poopie overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment after a while i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed up anal retentive br br and this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have all the scenes are in a sort of washed out blue steel hmmm the last time i checked candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors in fact the light they put out tends to be more in the yellowish orange range of the spectrum so where's all the blue steel grey light coming from br br this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx but it's still dreck it's pathetic junk put out for today's movie goers who are easily by pathetic junk br br i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices but this was a total hack job br br universal studios' 1941 the wolfman is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays br br i'm done with this franchise the first movie was reasonably decent the second still somewhat entertaining but this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring,0
3417,this is really the only chance to see the magic of james joyce's writing brought to life his novels are all unfilmable in any real sense and this is the only long story he wrote it was john huston's last film and did not reach the screen until after he had died and it is easy to see his touch of greatness the dead is poetical in its approach on the screen telling us more about ireland than any modern movie on the ira and the troubles could ever hope to tell us hopefully more people will watch this film and get to experience the finest of both john huston and james joyce and perhaps visit this story in your local bookstore and discover that it is probably the greatest short story ever put on paper,1
3418,all movies that contain goofy sound effects should be shot if there is one thing i hate it's gotta be the use of a whoop whoop whoo when somebody gets hit one the head the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle or rather fanning him with a beer bottle because she never really hits him with it yes ghoulies iv does suck but i have to wonder did they mean to not make the so called ghoulies mouths move when they supposedly talked their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 hell i can make a better mask out of construction paper some rubber cement and a handful of glitter this sucked,0
3419,i opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason alone samuel l jackson i happen to like him a lot i had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film so went into it with no real expectations br br jackson didn't disappoint as lazarus a down on his luck blues man in the deep south and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes but the real surprise here was christina ricci at best a vapid airhead in real life who took the role of the sexually abused town tramp rae and made her a believable almost even likable character watching the decidedly non sexual relationship evolve between lazarus and rae was simply amazing br br justin timberlake pop star turned wanna be actor should go back to causing wardrobe malfunctions and prancing around a pop stage his mostly forced performance was distracting at best from the real story here br br this movie is raw gritty and at times quite in your face not everyone will like it those that do however will be quickly moving it to the top of their favorites list,1
3420,i feel as though i know these people and have known people similar to them these days though people are discouraged from showing such passion about anything especially love and loneliness it has a slow beginning but then look out if you love romantic comedies but would like to see one that had some basis in reality for a change or at least did have back in the 70's then you should see this movie,1
3421,the problem i have as a finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every finnish movie i have a feeling that finland has only like five actors i think that if you're not from finland you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty br br this movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite harshly alcoholism cold climate and darkness may all be clichés but they're still very real in todays finnish society a lot of people in finland have depression especially during winter br br the tone of the movie is very melancholic i enjoyed it and directing was again very solid i liked this movie a lot only negative thing is that you see the same faces that you've seen over and over again,1
3422,the worst film ever with characters from carnosaur 1 3 inserted merely to fall to the same demise that they had in the first film so that footage and special effects could be reused br br stay away from this debacle br br corman is ruining his legacy he made and produced some amazing films but that era ended with carnosaur being his last creative in its badness film,0
3423,i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this but i think dog the bounty hunter is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of high octane cop shows such as csi csi miami and so forth i'm not saying all these shows are bad but they aren't good either i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this stereotypes that's right stereotypes unfortunately this is a show for the of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime for example there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth punk clothing and they start harassing him now this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth punk culture i mean come on how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood okay not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime drugs poverty again this is what middle red state america sees of these people finally why is the the bumbling sidekick can't you make the sidekick an equal ass kicker,0
3424,cooley high is one of my favorite movies ever i think i saw this movie years ago on late night tv with my mother when i was little and i thought it was so funny this movie was also referred to as a black american graffiti glynn turman is wonderful as preach and lawrence hilton jacobs is great as friend there are some other great characters in it as well and this movie has a lot of humor packed into it from the beginning of the movie where goes to home to get ready for school to the sad ending of funeral this movie is one that will get you laughing all the way there are a lot of scenes in this film that i like a lot the scene where another one of preach and friends go to the zoo with them and gets the gorilla's feces thrown on his shirt very gross but funny as well the first scene in the street corner cafeteria the quarter party at this girl's house which became a disaster due to a fight and some others are wonderful to watch this movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album which is packed with a lot of wonderful motown hits and artists from the early 60s only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in '75 while the rest were from the '60s the movie is mainly about two friends who dream about getting away from their impoverished and rough neighborhood after high school but their futures seem almost out of reach due to their innocent joy ride in a stolen car that two other hoods were responsible for and relationship with his girlfriend brenda played by cynthia davis almost gets put in jeopardy go out and rent or buy this movie and be ready for a load of comical entertainment get the soundtrack too it is a lot of fun as well,1
3425,a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had a flat tire the other's jeep mysteriously won't start one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice mr who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermit like house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about davy his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there of course one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again is it is it davy the mannequins tourist trap has the usual horror requirements jiggly big girl goody two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending i started to feel sorry for chuck is a terrific creepy over the top performance at a point in the film and you almost see the character of molly doing the same this is a gem if you can find it i had taped it off of cable when i was younger and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced but well worth it fans of tanya roberts won't be disappointed either best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and crackers br br i gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain,1
3426,double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie br br it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy and it happens more than once in double shock i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode br br we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder but something about the murder troubles columbo the end is the usual we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery br br this is another good columbo episode and i will rate it 7 10 it is close to 8 10 br br just one more question the acting peter falk is very good as usual,1
3427,i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance i really hope norton did not do this he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie br br i found it entertaining it wasn't mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects but it was not a bad it was fun to watch but yea definitely not a bad horrible movie br br 7 10,1
3428,one has to take martin lewis like a dash of salt pepper why does martin put up with lewis then again why do all the women in this movie like jerry because he is innocently likeable martin sings a few good songs lip at least once and jerry manages to kiss more girls than in all his other movies combined i generally find that i can take just so much of jerry's antics before they become aggravating but in this film watch when jerry gets stuck outside on a submerging navy submarine excellent buster keaton should have been proud i give the film a 7,1
3429,this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinema to which i have ever born witness not only was the name a complete misnomer since the film has next to nothing to do with piranhas but the acting is as hollow and stale as the attempt to actually make some kind of plot when you watch this film you cannot help but spend every waking second questioning when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off unfortunately i waited until the end in my case that's two hours of my life that i will never be able to reclaim,0
3430,i don't dislike cary grant but i've found his performances annoying in enough films to notice this arsenic old lace and bringing up baby i don't dislike him in north by northwest but i really find that movie unbearably silly on top of that i find the endless raving about grant's class tiresome i don't have a clue what his class does for the viewers who herald it it doesn't do a thing for me br br in the behind the scenes feature included with this dvd hitchcock says that grant was her fathers favorite leading man i think he was wrong jimmy stewart was a better leading man in a string of better hitchcock movies br br with it's ruined ending this is really half a movie and doesn't bear discussion and can't support the high ratings it's getting even if the movie had it's ending intact there's not much to it fontaine is a completely unsympathetic sucker she has to remain numb and unwilling to contact anyone but johnny for the whole movie in either ending for his ploys to work that's not much to work with cary grant begins every line with until i wanted to strangle him he says it about sixty times it's positively grating hitch's technique here is shockingly shallow an endless succession of rooms sets have a phony skylight projected on the rear wall as a effect and a light bulb in a glass of milk may make fans excited but it can't save a movie this poorly made br br peter bogdanovich should retire if he does one more hitchcock cary grant imitation on a dvd i think that's his whole career now as soon as i saw him i thought oh crap here comes an imitation that only he's impressed with instead there were two oh joy,0
3431,dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects not recommended for any reason the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the nevada desert that's it i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest oh i thought of one other good point about this cheese it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly check out for a good science fiction b movie,0
3432,i actually had seen the last parts of this movie when i was a child thanks to the search feature of plots i was able to find out the name of it for years i did not know the name but the movie stuck in my mind the ending left hope that the main character would get back to earth eventually it was a shame it did not make it to a series this movie reminds me of journey to the far side of the sun also known as doppleganger if you liked this feature the other one is worth a watch it was done before the stranger but shares a similar plot yet different i just picked up the stranger off of ebay on vhs hope they make a dvd but it is doubtful unless it comes out on dollar dvd a few pilots are making it on the budget dvd's and maybe this one will,1
3433,henry don ameche turns up at the entrance to hell and recounts his life story to his excellency laird cregar the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life and in particular his relationship with martha gene tierney at the end of the film we cut back to henry and his excellency for a very predictable ending br br unfortunately there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens its a sentimental story of one man's life and its very boring i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish despite the lubitsch touch i yawned more than 15 times hugo charles coburn is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn't enough to save this from going into the reject pile in the same mould as its a wonderful world and you can't take it with you and so not surprisingly it was nominated for an oscar a story about ordinary people none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest boring sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an ending that i can remember,0
3434,this was the typical women prison movie i thought the women were very sexy and the outfits were great all the camera did was focus on the women and the women were always in provocative poses for the camera and they were always scantily dressed which i loved this is your basic prison breakout movie of the 70's all i can say about this film is that it's extremely cheesy but the women are gorgeous and their butts are great,0
3435,how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie the lack of script is one thing but the cinematography makes you want to weep a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden it would be a shame for the industry if he or any in the team for that matter is given money to make a film ever again this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year,0
3436,the final frames of the original american graffiti provide one line summaries of the fates of the film's four central male characters while somewhat sexist in omitting the female characters the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most ardent fan of the movie would want however someone felt that mega bucks could be made by detailing the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended bad move making an insurance salesman and his wife a nerdy private in vietnam a drag race driver and a overgrown hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie while most of the original cast is back with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away more american graffiti is a mess of silly situations that involve protests car races country singers and the vietnam war the use of split screens once thought innovative and daring is overused here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson even the use of period music which was a delight in the original is poorly done here if you want more american graffiti see the original twice,0
3437,living in edinburgh and have a great thirst for history i was very put off by the taken wrong breed of dog for a start owner old jock was an old single man who came to edinburgh and died a pauper in lodgings not like in the film at all for anyone coming to edinburgh and hoping to see sights of the film you will not find the graveyard in princes st gardens there were a few moments were a tissues would have been great the actors were fantastic at padding out a rather flimsy script i don't feel the poor wee bobby actually got enough screen time possibly due to being lost at one point all that said the film was fine and any 8 yr old will enjoy,0
3438,bill paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra ordinary game of golf the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds br br the acting is exemplary throughout stephen is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is shia who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment for those who are only familiar with his slap stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears br br a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie,1
3439,the movie opens with a scene that simply could not be a man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully morning blessings are recited but only the ones gitai finds controversial the rest are conveniently omitted then while in and a he kisses his wife good morning this is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home let alone a home amos is not interested in accurately portraying life he is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films the ritual bath scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a wedding i have many problems with the way of life but i have no use for amos commentary on these issues he would have you think that the are all dense with severe bouts of depression i may not agree with the lifestyle but i acknowledge that life has many layers amos gitai is blinded by his own pseudo intellectual stubborness and is therefore incapable of portraying an accurate of life aside from his poor research and unbalanced portrayal of life gitai fails in other aspects as well the plot is full of holes the dialogue loaded with silence the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting while at times powerfull was too often loaded with melodrama the movie drags on and on and the ending is not worth sticking around for watch if you must but be warned if you want to learn about life go to the communities and talk to do not rely on film,0
3440,this is a film that revolves around two mysteries which i have now br br first did the film makers understand the concept of before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock comment on or pay homage through self depreciating humour to the original work in other words there should be reasons to parody such work and they should definitely be clever i didn't see any of those in the film i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery bryan probably went to eric roberts and said hey i was drunk last night watching survivors and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release i want you on board without reading the script because i plan to direct this film without one br br and herein lies the second mystery eric robert's career i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky now i realize it's because he is stupid and therefore deserves the career that he had after watching this movie it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films which has higher budgets more intense scenes and roles better acting and direction more elaborate and compelling plot lines and a much wider audience than this b movie reject c movie,0
3441,first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would i chose the italian version over the r2 but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 claiming to be a special edition i never knew there was a uk dvd release but the promised were not actually on the disc just a couple of duff trailers anyway as to the film itself just as i was recovering from night train murders my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month this time in an italian uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi unhappily married but nailing one of his students becomes the main suspect joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case sorry to say i was less than entranced it was watchable but more than equally miss able and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime the surprise killing of cristina galbo which was actually spoilt by the dvd cover telling me about it grrrrrr and a surprise twist that cast the victims in a new light i thought this was very routine put me off the two sequels though with karin hannibal brooks baal and camille i spit on your grave keaton,0
3442,i've never expected too much from a film by trashy b movie director jim wynorski a silly premise some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes and i'm usually fairly happy br br well cheerleader massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter and when a film has the word in the title and on the gore then houston we have a problem br br movie centres on a group of cheerleaders who along with their teacher mini bus driver and a couple of guys become stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm they make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat where they find food and shelter and a crazy killer who wants them all dead from the outset good old jim ensures that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with t a and includes the obligatory shower scene along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get nekkid including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very gratuitous three babes in a hot tub scene none of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders and are never even seen in their outfits but who cares about such details when they're all too willing to strip off in the name of art br br i do care however about the movie's numerous lacklustre deaths with such an extremely lurid title i had been hoping for some inventive bloodletting to go with all of the bums bush and boobs instead practically all of the killings occur off screen or feature next to no gore only a silly post decapitation scene achieved with cheap as chips cgi comes anywhere near to delivering the goods br br still if you're feeling in the mood for some titillation or a bit of slasher silliness minus the grue then at 82 minutes at least cheerleader massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time,0
3443,this must be the dumbest movie i've ever seen and therefor it deserves a special award ok so it begins pretty good logical humor and then rapidly changes to complete and utter uh f rt ss stupidity that makes total sense the strange thing is that i hardly laughed at it though i guess it is supposed to be funny with a very serious message after a moment of thought why i didn't laugh the answer was pretty clear this movie is a lot more realistic then i would like it to be so it is extremely dumb yet very wise if the object was to reach people which aren't with a whole lot of neurons and synapses and electrolytes huh electrolytes this movie might actually be understood at some level by a big audience br br although they probably just laugh br br ah well nice try br br i am now editing well adding to my comment cause i read some of the other comments first i noticed some people see racism in this movie well that did not at all cross my mind when watching it however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some we could of course debate the link between intelligence and race but i think this is not the place to do so i wonder if we were to rate the family here would you complain about them all being black i don't think so but i guess you could aside from that from the 2 wisest people in the world half the woman doesn't seem totally caucasian to me so 'what the problem is ' br br secondly the movie gets very mixed ratings from 1's to 10's and everything in between but a lot of there which means the movie does its job very well it people up makes them want to speak about it and judge it that means it is a good movie whether you like it or hate it after 5 minutes it becomes very predictive and boring even yet you keep watching this utter crap i guess you keep hoping that it isn't so or maybe it's our sick way to look at terrible accidents well this is one for sure,1
3444,my original comment on this particular title was deleted by a imdb user or the staff only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film where's my freedom of word br br obviously this movie was made by students 'cos so lame and amateurish it felt of course even they have to start from somewhere the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting with low budget and b class actors what can you expect there's some cgi in places so poor it looks like done with an old pc some may say this is sort of an alien clone only this time it's dracula in a vintage costume who's sucking the other cast dry one by one the sets are unconvincing cheap and small boiler rooms although the story takes place in a large space craft br br it would be fun to know what the stars erika eleniak casper van dien coolio and udo kier thought about the film after it was released coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever br br it was a total waste of my time and money don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick honestly i just hate this film with uwe boll's house of the dead dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever well i've seen even worse than these two br br avoid any other film will do better,0
3445,i don't get it i just don't get it barney and friends has been lambasted by millions through the years and i will admit i was one of those any child who watches this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of trash barney is very annoying and very selfish add baby bop and it gets even worse add b j then you have a very creepy television nightmare then you get the children they're old enough to know what barney is trying to teach them what are they doing there in the first place it would be funny if barney and his friends appeared on the jerry springer show that would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it as we have seen less and less of the more informational and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s what a big difference a selfish son of a gun makes when this show leaves pbs a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people but a huge dent will have been made in the annals of television history a message to barney himself you may not realize it but your days are numbered br br in a nutshell there are other choices better choices,0
3446,amazing amazing amazing what more can be said jacobi is the best hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character every nuance and element of hamlet is depicted and depicted well some people have complained about his age but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film if anything he looks drastically younger than 40 i only wish a more worthy ophelia could have been found her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part the only real exceptional performances come from jacobi and stewart who is a great claudius the rest of the cast is good but jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay,1
3447,this movie was shot using a digital camera and it shows there were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer also with the help of a terrible score as if that weren't enough the acting was also terrible now in hartley's movies the acting is always peculiar but here it was just bad especially by satan thomas jay ryan and harvey who thank god doesn't get to say much after all these external problems it is also very unfortunate that the story itself is not that good either the jokes are predictable and unbelievably straightforward and the events just rumble on from one incident to the next the so called book of life with armageddon inside isn't much more than an excuse to see actors struggle to say their lines all in all this movie is a waste of time and money and effort thumbs down,0
3448,i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss 117 films of the 50's and 60's the first oss 117 film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956 long before the first james bond film staring ivan desny as hubert de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc frederick stafford kerwin matthews and john all taking turns as oss 117 jean is in the title role in this comedic take on the series as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery jean françois wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend it borrows on the silliness of naked gun get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss 117 reworked to comedy adventures michel directs i would give this a 7 5 and recommend it,1
3449,this really is the worst movie i have ever seen for a while i made a habit of watching lousy movies including battlefield earth delta force commando and starship all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to br br there isn't much point in summarizing this piece of junk i think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie which is as follows i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after roughly 80 minutes of play br br i rate this movie a 0 but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than 1 i give it a 0 knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely many times better than this one that's really how bad it is,0
3450,tepid poorly produced 70's made moore because of today's headlines nonetheless this film is worthy stink fodder because of acting absent direction and silly 70's clothing sadly the moocow remembers when clothing was all the rage this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci fi moovies namely westworld and logan's run while the premise interesting rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever the film makes the mistake of saddling us with richard tim donnelly a clone who is at once both boring and irritating hollow acting by donnelly doesn't help but fits right in with the rest of the cast even such b as dick sargent bewitched tv series ghost with 1 000 000 eyes keenan wynn dr strangelove the dark laserblast and peter graves beginning of the end killers from space it conquered the world provide only the moost tepid performances produced directed and edited by a bunch of nobodies it's no surprise that fails to horrify anyone in the least much less keep anyone's attention truth be told there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock fans would love wanna see some bad funny 70's films put on anything by greydon clark is no bonus the moocow says even the mst3k version is a yawner so proceed at yer own risk 8p,0
3451,a funny thing happened to me while watching mosquito on the one hand the hero is a deaf mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does mutilating mannequins er excuse me corpses through his images on the other hand the english version at least is very badly dubbed so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time this film is stupid funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town and lurid where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene not to mention the romantic aspect oh how sweet miss it,0
3452,being an unrelenting non stop over the top explosive melodrama this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced and utterly unbelievable in every way the pace is constantly fever pitched and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria it is nigh unwatchable and a stain nay a blotch on the careers of everyone involved br br the wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself resulting in a movie where you just go come on all the time the setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously i can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10 br br if you want to see a good asteroid movie see deep impact which is intense sensitive and thoroughly engrossing everything armageddon is not,0
3453,the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast dwellers it is weird though to find an independent movie the brainchild of a single person that is as and cliché ridden as a committee hollywood potboiler br br the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate i think but these characters don't ring true to me i have had quite a few meals in small town diners but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth century english novelists one might suggest that writer director has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers and considerably less satiric verve,0
3454,since others have complained about putting sherlock holmes into a contemporary setting i won't do that basil rathbone could have fit in in any era with that voice that savoir faire this is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on the dancing men one of the best of conan doyle's stories instead of the original plot it makes the men part of a nazi plot holmes becomes a spokesman for the british war effort his adversary is moriarity who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the friday 13th films he is certainly creative but the rathbone holmes is unflappable watson is just along for the ride in this one he isn't given much stupidity to spout in this film and that's a real plus the plot is complex enough to keep ones interest there is a concluding speech that is almost a parody of itself but then i can't be critical of a time and nation that was under great duress if they needed to call in holmes so be it,1
3455,return to me is a movie you will want to own it is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages the story though seemingly impossible aspires to divine intervention when a man looses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart david duchovny and minnie driver give warm hearted performances as the designated to be lovers who meet by chance but the real story lies in the friends and family around them who love and support them in times of trial carol o'connor as minnie driver's grandfather is authentic in every scene bonnie hunt as the friend whose wit and encouragement underlines minnie as a is funny yet warm in the scenes especially with james belushi as her husband classic scenes and writing makes this story so enjoyable and touching to watch over and over again thank you for making a movie that demonstrates families and friends as close knit caring people who love each other through difficult times,1
3456,now we know movies the excellent paper will be blue and boogie but its worth to see again or at last this first furia which shows perfectly clear his initial qualities br br its very interesting to see how his beginners talent developed into confirming him as one of the best romanian contemporary directors br br of course the movie itself is excellent intelligent and professional script sure handed direction stylish photography definitely one of the best in the most serious and competent sense also storytelling sense is compelling and gripping and he actors well they simply rock,1
3457,this movie one of the best i've ever seen talks about it does it plunging ourselves in a taipei stained in cold colors where the rain falls incessantly a damp world it does it displaying us the story of two persons living in this world a man and a woman a coincidence or the fate links their existences but they're not able to open one to the other with words characters are the mirror of the difficulty of our society concerning interpersonal relationships an that here is taken to the extreme limits all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie dialogues are nearly absent and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty far away from describing people's real feelings so the progression of the story the revelation of character's feelings is developed brilliant idea by the musical digressions only apparently meaningless that speckle the movie the proceeding of the sentimental event and the drama of female protagonist lead us to a splendid ending heavily symbolic a movie totally different from the usual a clever realization by a great talented director ps forgive me for my bad grammar,1
3458,this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the quickest i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with basically this is the deal two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer keaton is it worth it no,0
3459,i saw this movie at the philadelphia film festival today and enjoyed it overall it is an interesting and adept analysis of the all too common revelation that our parent's marriage was more flawed and difficult than we originally imagined in addition this movie is an excellent example of process of discovering truths about our parent's lives after their death and the issues associated with that however i found the sound quality recording and editing to be relatively poor and annoying it may very well have been related to the specific theater and projection conditions i am not a film maker student or anything and claim no real understanding of the sound production process but as a consumer i found the audio portion of the movie distracting specifically i heard very unpleasant lip smacking noises through out especially one long interview with the younger sister the film and often the background noise level was higher in volume than people's voices for example the scene when a small group was sorting through the mothers papers has anyone else seen this movie noticed anything about the sound thanks,1
3460,frank it isn't that i'm sorry i killed them it's that i'm sorry i killed them badly br br wow talk about a swing and a miss you have a great cast and a great plot with endless how do you f ck that up well apparently john dahl has found a way with an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable 'you kill me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007 on a positive note ben provides another great performance as the alcoholic polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap tea leoni is good as well as is luke wilson dennis farina bill pullman philip baker hall and the rest of the cast i guess the best way to describe 'you kill me' is a terrible movie with good performances grade d,0
3461,early talkie feature based on a popular stage play a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a séance to see who the murderer is while the lights are out there's another murder so it's someone in that room br br what follows is an obvious dull and creaky murder mystery most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree they act like they're on stage where you have to overdo things and it looks silly on screen most embarrassing is bela lugosi two years before dracula who really overdoes it as a police inspector static direction by tod browning who was always overrated doesn't help br br for browning and lugosi completists only i give it a 3,0
3462,if you have few expectations then this will entertain for 90 minutes my problem is that they've dumbed down this tale for the modern audience are already sexy exciting characters they don t need the techno soundtrack and snappy dialogue,0
3463,this film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little average budget looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him there is your basic bar brawl alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting some basic drama but nothing too deep isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it but the person who steals the show is br br scott adkins how come this guy isn't a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i don't know director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces 2003 which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed 2 check this guy out and make a noise this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now br br what else can i say about the movie it's van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work no oscars here for sure but you already knew that but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time so i'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre,1
3464,the student nurses is not a typical sexploitation movie sure the nudity and sexual openness is there but it's not all for laughs stephanie scripted a socially compelling well written tits ass movie which confronts the topics of racism socio economic rape abortion medical ethics public health issues human rights the vietnam war free love lsd and drug experimentation four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing at the same time sharon elaine is assigned to the terminal care ward lynn farrell to public health administration priscilla barbara leigh to and karen carlson to psychiatry these four beauties have ample opportunities to disrobe and fornicate of which they take advantage much to the delight of male viewers these are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution after all and are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful visceral yet low budget action sequences are interspersed throughout there's a very bloody gunfight at the resistance movement headquarters in which two policemen are shot and killed along with several members of the group an anti vietnam war protest consisting of spookily dressed young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent with cops beating protesters the effective trip sequence on the beach consists of beautiful weird and confusing sensory and memory montages with hyper sensual overtones in short the student nurses is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times expressed through real women's perspectives since it was written and directed by a woman but it's still fun and titillating despite its sobering treatment of subject matter,1
3465,forgettable pilot that never really explains why nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie but rob estes plays a a hunky cop who happens to be nostradamus for some reason and who battles time travelling medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse oh yeah there's also a sexy fbi agent who happens to be a and is trying to get rob to believe everything before it's too late too bad they couldn't predict a better plot yawn br br,0
3466,i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters and i saw it in japan the film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore but i went to see it for the 3 d process it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it though it never screened at the post theater br br the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience which was taken to absurd levels with later 3 d films br br i don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler but you've been warned if it is in many films of the time actors would often work in front of a rear projection screen where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage this works well on regular films but when seen in 3 d they look like a flat scene behind the actors there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used and it didn't work well in the theaters if seen in 3 d it will constitute another disappointment br br the film's only importance is historical since it was the first of its kind,0
3467,this is my fourth review of a charlie chan movie in series chronological order on these consecutive days this is also my first comment of one i've seen previously though it's been about 24 years since then so i didn't remember much of it in this one the honolulu detective is investigating an espionage ring that was initially tracked by a former scotland yard acquaintance who has turned up missing in the big apple this is the best of the chan entries i've seen so far in current memory with every clue being connected though of course if i look at them at closer examination there could still be some holes though i can't think of any right now and no 2 son jimmy victor sen yung is somewhat of a help when he first identifies the poison that results in some murders early on though of course he blunders a little later among the returning supporting cast from the last chan film charlie chan at the wax museum are blonde joan valerie as june preston and stanley blystone who's brother john g helmed a lost chan one called charlie chan's chance as a fingerprint expert nice intrigue especially with an exciting climax aboard a bomber plane oh and watch for a certain stooge at a police line up,1
3468,seeing les amants calls immediately for comparison with bertolucci's movie 'the dreamers' in my opinion the best film made about the 1968 revolt of students in paris actually director philippe garrel does not seem to avoid comparing with his much more famous colleague sharing the principal actor and even including a direct replica eye in viewer eye about an older film of bertolucci and yet lar is a different film and an interesting one br br the story line seems also familiar the movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 maybe among the best done until now the film is made in black and white and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds eisenstein then as in the dreamers the action moves in the parisian flat where the heroes of the defeated revolt make art smoke drugs dream and fall for one other there is no direct social comment no real explanation of the background of the revolt the movie focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters it's like a premonition of the process of transition to the establishment that the generation of the 1968 went through it's just that not all the participants may adapt or survive br br the film is more about the characters than about the events and it is merely for the style it will be remembered about the black and white cinema is memorable not only in the revolution scenes but also when looking at the characters evolution many sequences are enhanced by a technique that is derived from the silent films movies with long takes accompanied by a off piano tune the effect is exquisite yet the length of the film is hardly justified it lasts more than three hours and i doubt that cutting it to only two hours would have been a miss actually i am convinced it's quite a contrary br br without raising at the depth and subtlety of bertolucci's movie lar is another perspective to remember about one of the more important years in the history of france and of the world in the 20th century,1
3469,this is one of those movies where i just want to move my feet and dance around the house it's a very positive and happy type of music the movie has some sad parts but mostly the music is what makes me happy gary busey did a great job as buddy holly buddy holly kept on going even tho his pastor his parents and the nashville record producer told him no buddy holly didn't give up on what he liked i didn't know much about buddy holly until i watched this movie i've been to the surf ballroom where he last played but didn't give much attention to it until i watched this movie it's an incredible movie with lots of fun so get on your feet and see this movie,1
3470,susan sarandon is for lack of a better word incredible in my opinion and yes i do understand that not everyone will agree with me here she is one of the greatest actresses ever and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit i mean that was an amazing performance in lorenzo's oil but then i think every performance of hers is amazing and they gave it to emma thompson what was that about and by the time she got this oscar she'd been in the industry for some 25 years i couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of sister helen but then again she is over and above all the artificiality of hollywood and doesn't need an oscar people know she's good anyway br br this film carries some very deep thought messages so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly tim robbins of course can't escape credit here you would think that because of his person feelings against the death penalty the portrayals made in this movie wouldn't be accurate however both sides of the death penalty debate are given even weight on one side you see the interesting side of matthew the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart wrenching at the same time you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief stricken parents one word for tim bravo br br a brilliant movie and like i said a well deserved and long awaited oscar for susan,1
3471,well to start with i'm straight up as black as black gets and i can tell you it's very sad when black people think a black movie sucks i can't say i've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line br br snoop is my dawg and all but he wasn't feeling this movie at all i don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket of crap called a movie but i hope it's enough to wash the smell out br br i'm all about supporting a bothers movie but this one was bad really really bad it blew chucks in every aspect no real plot story sucked cast couldn't act and the best one there was the white guy br br i almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theatre half the crowd up and left before it was over i'm still wishing i had too save yourself some pain and go see something else anything else,0
3472,this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on heath in one sunny wednesday afternoon br br it shows 7 different types of couples married divorced breaking up a relationship homosexual elderly blind date and escort service they are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location so that is a disappointment the film is a collage of conversations without any discernible plot the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic i find this film boring and purposeless the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film it is sad that talents like ewan mcgregor and sophie get wasted by this film,0
3473,this is defiantly a dvd rental movie i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me don't expect oh brother where art thou in any way shape or form funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from oh brother where art thou but you could kind of tell they were trying for that john was the bright spot and was solid throughout renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story overall it's a movie worth watching at home,0
3474,a very accurate depiction of small time mob life filmed in new jersey the story characters and script are believable but the acting drops the ball still it's worth watching especially for the strong images some still with me even though i first viewed this 25 years ago br br a young hood steps up and starts doing bigger things tries to but these things keep going wrong leading the local boss to suspect that his end is being skimmed off not a good place to be if you enjoy your health or life br br this is the film that introduced joe pesce to martin scorsese also present is that perennial screen wise guy frank vincent strong on characterizations and visuals sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish but a great story,1
3475,a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart it is rare when a film maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent nine out of ten for a truly lovely film,1
3476,obviously with this film going straight to dvd i wasn't expecting a lot but this film is so unfunny it is unbelievable the only part of the film that you actually may find remotely funny is before they even get to the island where eddie's son is blasted out of the bathroom by a jet of water and then that's it why do they bother at all the first christmas vacation with chevy chase was brilliant and hilarious this is not they rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence and a character called uncle nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women when they approach the island on the boat the island in the background just looks so fake and randy quaid although funny in the previous film just overacts and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny you have been warned,0
3477,if you like stupid jokes and a terribly predictable storyline then perhaps this movie is for you courtney thorne smith jack warden and several other members of the supporting cast actually have talent but it was completely stifled by the paper thin script this is a generally boring and joyless time waster of a movie,0
3478,populist approach manifests itself in all his titles from the worst to the best he doesn't care or has no clue about art all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies the problem is the effort is way too evident and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration into them the effort fails badly br br on this turkish movie who knows where the original or originals were made since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino mr tarantino if you're reading this please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life he doesn't use subtle moves to do that all he does is to use extreme stuff and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable br br as the forensic guy with the cow licked hair is just hilarious i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself because i really found the role insulting for him groping her genitalia was also uncalled for and did nothing other than making everything look fake another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100 faulty pace setting when things need to be taken slowly scenes flow abruptly and at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on br br if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality he should use michael as his name instead even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach then realize he's not in hollywood and then take private lessons from or on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps br br by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever,0
3479,at least one kind very human and moving not out to teach a lesson or anything like that all principals are effective i saw the movie years ago and still remember it but can't remember the morgan fairchild role br br and a nice slice of american life,1
3480,at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships but it's like a dull toothache getting there also don't watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but it's a small one br br the film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war br br the film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible br br one real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 no effort was taken to bring this film into period br br in conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission you've seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding,0
3481,firstly i am a huge fan of crap films b grade is always good for a laugh unfortunately this film is just plain bad i dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film especially the big guy at the beginning it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons br br the acting is so bad i need not comment on why the effect are also extremely amateurish with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot br br it also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5 10 frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings br br i suggest everyone avoid this movie it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life br br absolutely awful,0
3482,don't get me wrong the guy's a success dynamo but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market br br see the invincible iron man wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward children but it's not directed exclusively at children periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi nude bodies to make network censors squirm so it isn't quite cut out for children's television br br so what audience is this video aiming for then it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings that's who and i think that audience is small br br a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's over the decades so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who like mr are better accustomed to action figures during saturday morning cartoons how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy br br br br animation just passable cels some segments are better than others a low budget look all throughout this ain't no bakshi ralph and it ain't no bluth don cg animation's okay but far from impressive br br story a litany of clichés all over the place convoluted contrived and uninspired br br characters so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to sexual ambiguity hmmm her dad's in a wheelchair tony misses his mom asian chicks are hot and apparently little else the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the end br br performances can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script br br art very western musculature very clean lines faces are very derivative of eastern art very boring mattes very bland cg br br conclusion not great but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths a 'must buy' for collectors a valuable what not to do course for junior animators,0
3483,this is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and i stopped caring this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex there's a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man's floor so you can see into the woman's below apartment also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports br br sounds promising br br not really br br i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film basically i started not watching which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up br br it may work for you it didn't for me,0
3484,pointless movie about making a movie no where near the flesh shown in the original which was quite enjoyable and even had fun music not here br br it's always fun seeing the guy though,0
3485,this is a big disappointment the main problem is the acting le is pretty poor as fanny and the rest are not much better everybody is very stilted and unnatural also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy compared with the likes of 1995's p p for example br br the script is if anything too faithful to the book and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut br br in every way this is far inferior to the recent film version which though it took huge liberties with the book seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable,0
3486,dark harvest 3 scarecrow 1 out of 10 in einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time or so i've heard in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change even on fast forward and you will be reaching for that fast forward button it clocks in somewhere around eternity br br if you are familiar with own version of project greenlight this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal mart you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within br br the line reading i refuse to call it acting is uniformly awful this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast scars in the nude scene br br the story is awful the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming is distracting beyond mere words avoid,0
3487,this story is an excellent tale of two boys that do whatever they can to get away from there abusive drunkard father lord of the rings star elijah wood is outstanding in this unforgettable role this movie is one of the main reasons i haven't touched a single beer and never will as long as i live that might make me sound like a nerd but that's what i have to say it is a wonder why this isn't as a classic american tale,1
3488,i watched this film in the theater in along with 3 other americans and our friend from manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this br br opening with one of the worst jokes i've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile i cite the giraffe cum ming as a prime example br br the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen i think a lot more could have been done with that angle the two different worlds the fish out of water experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much and 'goof' as is humanly possible br br and to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought but no its a full length torture film of unfunniness br br as we were leaving the theater which had very little laughing inside it i overheard the young hip electro clash british couple behind me saying that was rather good wasn't it you never really knew what was coming next and the girl responding yeah quite surprising and that was it if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end then this film succeeded but i have more belief in british life than that br br i've not not laughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii,0
3489,i hope from his seat on heaven's comedic throne spike milligan can see and can enjoy this film as terence ryan and ken have taken a book that the author himself said writing it nearly turned me mad into a joy to watch br br the film tells the story of the irish town of and the problems befallen upon it when the partition between northern ireland and the republic is drawn up cutting its way through the centre of the village and more worringly through the middle of the this causes some deceased buried in the catholic to now be in the protestant north and so the local priest assisted by a wide variety of eccentric locals aims to move the bodies back undercover of darkness and so avoiding the bureaucratic british border guards br br it was inspired work to cast the irish comedian and poet sean hughes to play the part of madigan he brings an innocence to the part especially in his to camera pieces which is normally where he interacts with the voiceover of richard attenborough playing supposedly the writer director of the film playing father is also worthy of considerable praise and the rest of the cast from the household names like elliott gould and rhys jones to people with what would normally be called such as spike's daughter jane who plays wife give 100 the credit for this goes in no small part to the wonderful characterisations given by spike in the original book br br i could argue that the film is slightly too long or that elliott gould's irish accent left a little to be desired but those would be only minor points and take nothing away from the excellence of this film,1
3490,i bought this movie just to see bam because i was really loving him but after seeing this i don't like him much i mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself alright we know you're a professional skateboarder now can we get back to ryan dunn dunn rake and brandon really made the movie in my perspective br br i noticed that obviously and missy were both in haggard but who bam was dating at the time anyways i actually enjoyed haggard and i think it's really like no other movie i've ever seen it's sort of in it's own category,1
3491,it seems ever since 1982 about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be the next officer and a gentleman there has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different br br we get the usual ripped off scenes from i want you dor the instructor gives the richard gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit the gere character comes back for the girl the gere character realizes the instructor is great etc and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the east and is horribly miscast on top costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here kutcher is terrible in the richard gere character just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above keanu reeves br br the main problem with this wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one dimensional you never care for either in the least and when character finally turns around just like gere did in you just go so what the movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say oh wait we forgot to close out the girlfriend story or the what happens after he graduates story or the other six plot points in the movie what's more baffling is the great reviews i see here the general public's opinions never cease to amaze me,0
3492,why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made randy quaid's portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin eddie also the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie even eye candy sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap please do not waste your time on this move just watch the original again,0
3493,the basic idea behind dungeon of harrow isn't all bad the acting however is bad the lighting is bad the music is bad the scenes of torture are without emotion there really isn't much there to recommend this film you know what kind of a movie you're in for when the credits say special guest star and list someone you've never heard of might as well say rex hamilton as abraham lincoln because there's really no one in this movie you can identify there are one or two decent moments mostly toward the end and i think the basic plot outline may have contained an original idea but that alone is not enough to keep you awake through this otherwise inept yawner,0
3494,this review may contain spoilers or maybe not the warning is the same for all br br dang it just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies they give us this actually the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane deep blue sea etc that means a monster animal menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people in this case an alien in a train wow br br i must say that when i first saw this thing on cable i couldn't stop laughing no scifi film had prepared me for this it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical genre characters but since they're not so famous to say the least i wasn't expecting much of them except diamond phillips no comments there but i think the guy was desperate to find a job the problem was something called 'special effects' horrible even for scifi channel standards that model toy they made us believe it was a real train not to mention the model toy helicopter bigger than a train's wagon the meteor coming from space the 'baby' alien a sock puppet and i ain't kiddin' the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly while they were static when they started moving it was awful the explosions the terrorist blew up literally and what about the exploding helicopter just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying the insane mathematics used they couldn't even solve a school problem right and i won't talk about that doomsday like ending by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying if i remember right i did both br br it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh alone or with friends but be warned it's so ridiculous at so many levels and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief,0
3495,the setup for nature of the beast is ingeniously simple and fraught with limitless potential for suspense harried salesman jack a very domesticated lance henriksen picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker adrian eric roberts who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack oh and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed man' is dismembering people in the desert sounds great right sort of like the hitcher meets psycho one or both of these men has a secret and nothing is as it seems well unfortunately writer director victor salva of jeepers creepers and powder fame doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie going the scenario arouses no tension or suspense poison for what is supposedly a 'thriller' and the inclusion of an underlying homo erotic tone seems out of place henriksen evokes an unusual not quite earthbound everyman even sporting an ample gut but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in death wish 3 we're never sucked in to the point where we actually care about what's happening and the conclusion slides into improbable territory i kept thinking it was going to be fight club all over again but i was mistaken too bad nature of the beast could have been something else instead of nothing else,0
3496,if you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival do not be misled by what it says in the booklet this is a complete waste of time and energy i have watched bunuel i have seen dali and admired them but this isn't surrealism this is not supposed to be at all didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture after we become extinct by global warming these will be the of our civilization what if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital with all due respect to the effort put in this maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film or whatever it is,0
3497,being a middle aged mom myself i very much appreciated seeing a romance between grown up people that weaves in the many issues that effect us br br diane lane beautifully portrays adrienne and the sacrifice and conflict that a mother goes through wanting to do what is right for her children but still have a happy life herself br br i am not a big richard gere fan but he always does a good job with the guy who is sort of jerk but learns something about himself br br criticism of their romance as unrealistic is hardly justified when compared to most other romantic movies when nicole kidman and hugh jackman fall in love riding across australia with barely a conversation between them its considered high romance we get so much more here with she redeems him he sets her free its beautiful br br the intimacy they create by sharing their deepest insecurity fans into a flame of passion how long it takes is irrelevant perhaps the movie was a bit too subtle in the point that it was the letters they shared over the following year that deepened their relationship again another real life time honored way to get to know a person br br as much as i enjoyed the plot and themes the dialogue was not consistent in quality some lines rang so true and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat br br i also enjoyed the relationships with adrienne's teenage daughter and her best friend reminding us that there are many types of love not just romantic love br br this is not a lighthearted romantic comedy more a romantic drama it does have a very relaxed pace that some might consider too slow br br the beach house is a work of art fabulous look for the driftwood bench on the porch in the first pan over the house very beautiful i also enjoyed the music and scenery which combined to create the effect of the location as being the third main character it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light br br if you are old enough to appreciate these themes and are in the mood for a good cry get out the kleenex and enjoy this movie,1
3498,this movie is such a good movie shah ruck khan does a great job as the crazy mad villain who is totally obsessed with br br the girl the story is fantastic the acting by all br br characters like the girl and shah ruck and sunny are all fabulous and i really love the first song especially how it comes back at the end oh and its so emotional if your a true shah ruck khan fan you have gotta watch this movie because its the best shah ruck khan movie ever he plays an excellent role and i wish he done more crazy man roles but u have to watch this what so ever this is a really good movie this is a really good movie you have to watch it it is truly amazing you have to watch it it is fabulous i can go on and on about this movie because it is a fun funny scary cool and totally fantastic movie in the world,1
3499,i'm not sure how this could have been better so i gave it a 10 the acting was excellent the main woman was so hot the chap who played was a smouldering pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering the truck driver's death is one example excellently the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right i e i love lost but will it ever end as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him but the other agencies were portrayed positively my main thought about programmes like this and the also excellent 24 is could it happen would it happen is it happening now possibly probably br br i hope they do another series but after reading some of the previous comments it would appear not br br to summarise if you haven't seen it make sure you do,1
3500,no emotion bad music and i am a reformed eighties metal guy so i would be vulnerable to some good stuff everything is half done the brother is a parody there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next the tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time wahlberg is okay and aniston is slumming we know she didn't need the money is this the only role she could fit into her summer break surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on vh1 which is only slightly less often than ozzy does it barely qualifies as a tv movie it's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically,0
3501,the imdb plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is noah taylor's movie when fairuza balk is the central character it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish pointless non movie balk breaks up with boyfriend taylor sleeps with the devil i guess played by dempsey and accidentally kills taylor who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost may be the worst movie i have ever seen,0
3502,this is the kind of film one initially selects to make up the numbers from video rental only to discover an under rated entertaining and enjoyable movie the opening sequence of the police arriving at a dark and rainy house wherein the wife has committed murder or is it and the remainder of the film seeks to unravel what really happened ok the film is a bit campy but has good editing and dialogue professional acting often humorous and the very last scene with the facial expression is one of the best of its' kind definitely worth watching deserving at least a 7 or an 8,1
3503,oz was the first original television show that hbo put onto its channel in the 1 hour forma and it remains to this day the very best the story is simple oz is a surreal look into the lives of high maximum security prisoners at oswald primarily focusing on em city now there are many things to compliment this show on from the writing which in my opinion was the best on television when this show aired directing top notch acting best of the best and the characters this show just literally blew my socks off this show was a critically acclaimed gem until the sopranos bowed after that critics were salivating over that epic tale of trust and family to notice this compelling drama oz to me is a better show than sopranos overall and it's a shame that i never won any major emmy's br br kudos to all who were involved in this magnificent gut wrenching show br br kudos,1
3504,this film is so awful it is funny not quite to troll 2 levels of hilarity but funny nonetheless the acting is awful the music is atrocious and the story does not make a blind bit of sense the story revolves around a man dressed in an awful granny costume killing a bunch of people at a party the death scenes are so badly done they are hilarious one girl is stabbed repeatedly in the chest but does not scream try or defend or self or run away she also manages to remain standing despite being stabbed repeatedly another death scene involving a rope is also extremely hilarious no thought seems to have been put into the plot the granny seems to magically move from one area to another e g be hiding under leaves in a woodland just where the victim just happens to stand appears in front of someone even though it had been behind them ten seconds earlier people kiss at extremely inappropriate moments would you stop and kiss someone if you were being chased by a homicidal maniac and the double twist at the end is utterly ridiculous it seems they just threw it on just to confuse people i would advise people to watch this film if they love awful horror movies like troll 2 the dreaded or blood gnome but do not watch it if you are expecting a scary horror movie you will be disappointed,0
3505,whoa terrible terrible terrible terrible did i mention terrible you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me well someone brought this home for me to watch and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person because they used my money i will certainly be taking it back soon but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory for i definitely want to forget it this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible it's beyond horrible quite possibly the worst film ever the acting was so so so so horrifically disgusting as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was which kind of frightens me a little don't see this film shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page because you think this will be decent final word yuck,0
3506,swift's socialism and pacifism come through against all odds in this well done remake did you know there is no after well fact he meets warlike miniatures socialist giants head in the clouds literally philosophers and pacifist horses who rule over yahoos nearly neanderthal humanoids is that where yahoo came from we also meet the dastardly dr bates the devoted mary gulliver the sweet and devoted son thomas and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum suspension of disbelief comes easily and our 7 and 12 year old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and i did sorry for the length imdb requires 10 lines,1

3508,i have to admit i had never heard of this movie i caught it last night on tmc i thought it was hysterical i laughed so hard and loved the ending image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with dali and x and then all dropped lsd br br funny and edgy are two overused words these days this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot i had to be up at 6 00 am and watched it until 2 30 i over slept and missed my obligations still worth it i would not recommend renting it i would recommend owning it it was that good br br the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people bare with it and use your head br br i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time,1
3509,john candy and eugene levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster inept is truly the right word for this alleged comedy a few laughs but mostly groans and thoughts to yourself like why am i watching this c p yes that is meg ryan in this too which i am sure she doesnt want to be reminded of a waste of a talented cast on a scale of one to ten 0,0
3510,the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him i think that it is a must see older john wayne film,1
3511,i am very diplomatic in my reviews and as an academic writer try to give creative license to tv writers trying to a true story this story about karen carpenter could have helped so many yet due to the directing and editing does not br br the story in this case is not fully addressed unless one reads psychological journals while cynthia portrays a realistic karen it is sad that so much has been edited louise fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job with limited material and dialogue in this case i give the actors credit for surviving this project br br why is the audience not permitted to see factors american audiences are quite savvy and if they have cable usually educated br br i sincerely feel that i could have written a better story would not have edited out the truth and allowed the actors to project the reality br br richard carpenter as director has seriously underestimated and insulted american audiences karen's story is important and it is sad we will never hear it,0
3512,though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disaster br br john is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshing br br not recommended for americans who like political correctness,1
3513,one of if not the most visually beautiful film i have ever seen in my life there is so much to learn here in how to play with the camera color costumes and set up a shot the work that went into the official film web sites in english and french also give you a good idea of the sheer beauty contained in the film,1
3514,this is a very very odd film one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself the film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is you can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self importance additionally he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life br br later in the film he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head oddly this is only half way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life this is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor's novels one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them br br see this weird film it's amazingly compelling and not like anything i've ever seen before,1
3515,in the literal sense br br reminds you of those cops and robber or cowboys indians role playing games you played with your 8 year old friends br br tedious and un inspired the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot but all it does is showcase it i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting filmstock and editing br br destined to be a time filler on sci fi channel when they've overused everything else from their library and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream,0
3516,in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly manna from heaven br br in what could best be described as a cute movie approximately 350 years of movie acting experience allright give or take 100 years joyously lights up the screen to tell a tale of deceit remorse and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo ny br br truly well positioned to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters' five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart all while renewing your faith in mankind br br from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in a small non descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you've never been to buffalo you'll leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling off for a visit shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring a quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great lakes compliments rather than detracts from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's second cities instead of running off to a soundstage somewhere the end results would be so much more believable br br great performances by shirley jones frank gorshin wendy malick jill and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent hollywood's flavor of the week any time br br go see this movie br br you've wandered in hollywood's desert for too long,1
3517,i got subjected to this pile one wednesday afternoon when my mother in law was watching it i can't get over someone basically doing a remake of a crappy high budget hollywood flop the core with washed up actors like luke perry if the high budget one flopped what makes people think doing the same movie 2 years later with no budget would go anywhere i was laughing through most of the movie because of how insanely similar it was in fact i am shocked it's not held up in legal rather than airing on tv and how it was basically the script of the core just redone badly which if you have seen the core you know why doing it worse is funny since the core was already so bad it was funny br br if you enjoy getting a laugh out of really bad movies this one will be right up your alley the only thing i can say is that i wish luke perry was able to have a career because he isn't a horrible actor he just lands horrible roles crappy made for tv movies that will only run on daytime television is pretty much one step closer to the end for him if it wasn't for 90210 he would have a career,0
3518,best movie by far very funny very surrealistic if bunuel made a movie starring buster keaton as krusty the clown it would look like this br br brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies especially helmut as the sidekick of andreas who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though and of course helge himself as baxter is absolutely incredible br br p s if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that ist painting,1
3519,this formulaic film hero's girlfriend marries the villain just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story scott seems too old in this one and too many times his character turns away from decisive action the scenes he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly he escapes from gang by hiding in a full rain barrel his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous as does much of the film the plot could have been tightened br br high points of the film seeing tennessee ernie ford without a mustache singing man in the saddle alfonso too brief scenes as a cook the color photography of the high country and the fight scene there with john russell,0
3520,i live and work in lexington kentucky the town where zombie planet was filmed i'd heard about the film forever ago from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production then for several years i heard absolutely nothing imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store just itching for a rental so being the cinephile that i am i decided to give these local filmmakers a shot br br bad idea br br zombie planet is overlong boring poorly acted miserably shot and that's just the good stuff i tried my hardest to enjoy it which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline alas nothing worked zombie planet is so bad it's pathetic and the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms i'm sure they've heard move on you guys please in fact refrain from film making altogether or attend a few classes on pacing storytelling and well basic direction br br otherwise for the love of god hang it up,0
3521,i was 19 or 20 years old at the time and living in salt lake city utah and i still remember the new dome theater called the century 21 chairs that rocked and a new sound system large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater we felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film ta da da da ta da dada dada i can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of i loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas i know peter finch and luv and sally had some trouble with the lip sink but hey this was a feel good go feel better about things film what i regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it showed the cut version and then called it a flop i saw the cut version and i can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition yes i wince a bit at peter's effort to make love through music but you know i didn't see it that way when i left the theater when they surveyed us as we left i regret any comment i made that may have altered the original i liked it then and still see it while i listen to the music on my lp most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and i can use the films monologues in our games of what movie is this i wish a director's cut on dvd was available it is available on vhs but its not quite the same i would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins struggles and triumphs picky people should leave things well enough alone bring it back,1
3522,the 70s were without a doubt the golden age of made for tv horror this is one of those that was probably churned out as an abc movie of the week it's the old story of a house and or ghost possessing one of the new owners the movie has promise but it's never realized everything is rushed too much tension and suspense need time to build and grow and there's nothing new we've seen it all before and one better br br one final thought i don't understand why robert wagner's character would fall for the long dead movie star when he's married to kate jackson for goodness sake,0
3523,saying this movie is worse than on your own diarrhea is a generous understatement the only thing more pathetic than this reprehensible piece of garbage of a movie is the getting paid by the producers to register a bunch of accounts to post fake appraise br br if watching a poorly acted suspenseless snoozer of a movie about sloth from the goonies kill people in a fashion that completely ignores every law of physics pulling on an unrestrained person's legs causing them to be ripped from the torso is your idea of a good movie then knock yourself out br br no carbon based with a functioning lobe would consider in a million eons that this movie is scary or entertaining,0
3524,this movie i've seen many times i read the book which was written by who received the scandinavian book awards for the work the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts it happens in and the main character is young and having a good life with his girlfriend but as she breaks up the relationship with him he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins soon he is in the icelandic mental hospital called and there you get to see some great characters like viktor who thinks he is hitler and who thinks that he writes all the the beatles songs and sends them to them with mind transporting e who has the role of the main character does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless also the music in this movie is mad by and just for the music's cost you should see the movie overall a great movie meant to be seen,1
3525,i liked this a lot br br the camera angles are cool it's not all jumpy like a blair witch and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from kane's point of view lots of fun plenty of people were shouting at the screen br br kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions he's a lot less one dimensional than most horror heroes br br kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations there are not many twists here but it is clever and original in it's own way good creepy b movie slasher fare,1
3526,terrible direction from an awful script even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus laughable accents all over the map unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn out shots of nude or scantily clad young men usually wet or glistening with sweat looking longingly at each other,0
3527,i'm doing a thesis on blurring the boundaries the female cross dresser and am using tipping the velvet the book as my main text any comments on gender and sexual identity gender and sexual confusion gender as a performance gender as a fiction gender imagery cross dressing as an erotic fantasy and as revolution the effect of the male costume etc etc would be much appreciated but a bit off the point has anyone seen sergio 1987 film vera its about a young lesbian possibly transsexual cross dresser i'm dying to see it because i think it'd be really helpful does anyone know where i might get a copy of it i've tried amazon and a few other sites but no luck,1
3528,there are so many '10 best' lists which could easily fit the dead best screen drunk best literary adaptation best use of music not specifically written for the film best use of poetry best screen speech best ensemble cast and finally perhaps best film ever made this was john huston's last and greatest film adapted by his son tony from james joyce's short story and set on the evening of the feast of the epiphany in the dublin of 1904 it is confined largely to one setting the home of the sisters and not a great deal happens in conventional terms they entertain their guests there is singing dancing and much small talk but watching this film you can't imagine anywhere else you would rather be than in this company br br finally of course it is much much more it is about love loss and regret those stable mainstays of great drama in the film's closing scenes the tenor d'arcy frank patterson sings a song 'the lass of which conjures up in the mind of gretta anjelica huston wife of gabriel donal mccann the ghost of her first and probably greatest love a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen and suddenly gabriel realises he has never really known his wife and that he has not been the great love of her life after all emotionally these scenes are incredibly powerful firstly as gretta recounts the circumstances of her lover's death and then as the voice in gabriel's head sums up his own feelings this is great cinema the monologues superbly delivered by huston and mccann br br but then all the performances are extraordinary this is ensemble playing of the highest order and while it would be invidious to single out one performer above another has the screen ever given us a more likable genial or convincing drunk than donal donnelly or has poetry ever been delivered with such passion that sean the ira man in the quiet man brings to his reading of lady gregory's translation of here added poignancy is to be had of course from the knowledge that huston himself was close to death when he made this film which seems to me the culmination of his life's work death may well be its central theme but viewing this film is a life enhancing experience,1
3529,if you have been to the east of europe or even in their armed forces you might find this movie interesting i don't know why calls this a comedy sure there are a few funny moments but it is not a good movie if one of the orderly officers talks for 15 min about the achievements of socialism on a christmas dinner and the officers in general act like funny oafs the soldiers are running of the base to meet their girls at night and surprise surprise one of the girls is the daughter of the commander the east german army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its conscripted men and the comedy was basically not filmed on the facilities or with the equipment to make a good movie of the east german army and their time now gone by despite this some of the actors and actresses tried to act well but it came out only in the roles they're known for from east german tv and some small films i would not recommend this movie to anybody it was basically boring and very cheap made,0
3530,oh well i thought it should be a good action but it was not although jeff speakman stars there is nothing to watch only two fight for almost 1 5 hours yak a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it the plot is clear from the beginning if you want good action don't rent this movie,0
3531,when i went to see this movie it was already a forced choice as my original intent was sold out what then was sheer terror this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it the story is not worth mention a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who on discovering his sexual orientation gave him a hard time loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues it is absolutely astonishing that actors as or charly waste their talent and time on such nonsense 1 10,0
3532,yes this movie is obviously trying to be a conan the barbarian and what amazes me is that this is a sequel the people demanded another one the first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original from what i saw it doesn't look worth checking out and apparently ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies well now ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick thong a girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly the bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder what took him so long to snap meanwhile ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another they fight cavemen invisible soldiers don't ask rent a thugs and people who worship snakes ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang glides again don't ask all the while you will be thinking that conan would kick butt,0
3533,not a terrible movie but there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing not a good thing for a action thriller the acting is generally pretty decent for a scifi channel movie barry corbin plays a credible us senator and lou diamond phillips again gives us a decent military police sheriff agent marshal figure the special effects are well special for example the external train shots are very obviously a model train br br goofs a meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene the car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch after the impact the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at br br spoilers br br a good portion of the movie's events are predictable from the helicopter crash pull up pull up to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train to the sequel set up at the end br br the scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious they are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed remember the monty python rabbit spoiler goof in one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed later in the movie todd bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range on several occasions lou diamond phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands,0
3534,latest attempt to revive the series actually based on a pretty good idea but without the required gore fx violence for this type of thriller and thus boring good special fx sets costumes etc but the film comes of just plain silly and a near waste of time hopefully the next installment will correct this problem,0
3535,oh boy oh boy this movie is something for the lovers of real art it really does not make any sense at all it is totally boring especially because of the anti climaxes all people behave more than strange and unrealistic sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera and therefore the audience instead of each other like i said before if you are in to those more artful movies shown in cannes go for it if you are not better leave this movie alone because you will be more than disappointed and in the end know that you have wasted your time like i did two thumbs down,0
3536,anyone who gives this movie less than 8 needs to step outside puff a couple great story br br reality is for people who can't handle drugs,1
3537,bulletproof is quite clearly a disposable film the kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are everywhere so much so that you really aren't supposed to see them as human the yawns between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed they try hard but alas and persona itself does not a good film make jimmy caan plays a nifty villain but he's always had that redneck edge at the ready my favorite's scene is the repeated clips of a tv ad in which caan reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage aside from that it's a buddy movie with guns for brains pass on this one,0
3538,interesting premise interestingly worked out the strongest feature of this film is the emotional tension of the astronaut who knows a truth but is unable to convey it to others overlook the weaknesses and just enjoy the movie but be prepared for a certain level of suspense,1
3539,a sweeping and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances from ralph fiennes willem defoe and juliette binoche br br it tells the story of a badly burned man ralph fiennes who gets pulled out of a plane wreak during world war two and tells his nurse juliette binoche his story br br just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful katherine clifton kristen scott thomas however she is married to jeffery clifton colin firth and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair br br a very haunting and tragic story of love and desire set against some absolutely gorgeous locations in the desert a must see especially if your a fan of anthony work but be prepared to shed a lot of tears its very moving especially at the end,1
3540,could this be one of the earliest colour films it's actually the second this is a very beautiful piece of film produced by thomas edison this was one of many of his other films br br i think this is the most beautiful of any thomas edison films it shows a girl dancing and moving her dress all around which turns red with the film it's just beautiful br br you are watching history when you watch this you are watching what began to make movies of the day great this may not have a plot or anything very interesting but this is the second colour film ever br br i recommend this to everyone especially if you're teaching students about filming or something of the sort you have to show them what began color films,1
3541,chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain much as i did when watching it without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie but at least she does add an air of quality there are few if any more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business br br there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is a cheap disney re make aimed at very undemanding children i could watch ricci all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings but unless you too are a ricci fan a cat lover or very small child i doubt you will find this very entertaining,0
3542,brian what the hell were you on when you signed to do this br br i saw this recently at a festival and it was greeted by howling laughter throughout by the time the credits rolled tears were streaming down the faces of many of the audience br br the plot is a clunky melding of r ' and 'the x files' as cynically aimed at the tv audience as is possible to get without being sued the sequences involving the abductions are hilarious both yuzna's staging of the from the and mad george's pathetic plastic aliens drew gales of disbelieving derisive laughter br br limp camp and stupid my only hope is that it was an aberration as awful as 'return of the living dead 3' was good br br,0
3543,how does this movie suck as a fan of michael work on the sopranos i picked this up at blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise it still does but this movie doesn't fulfill it br br every turn of the story is entirely predictable i kept looking for the lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen it's all there the noble woman coming out of hard times the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts the kid who gets stuck in the middle etc etc etc the mysterious stranger's identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the tv i would have been more satisfied with little waking up and realizing it was all a dream br br the filmmakers may as well have had a the moral of the story is bit before the credits since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special don't gamble don't drink don't do drugs stay with your wife spend time with your kids come on how about a little nuance how about some interesting bad guys writer director a w should be singled out for special notice not only is the dialogue leaden the pacing within dialogue and at either end of many scenes makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be and believe me it feels like longer the talents of imperioli renee and some of the supporting cast steve schirripa natch are the only things that keep this from a 1 rating all of their good work is nearly offset though by the atrocious job of portraying the boy not sure if it was a casting mistake hey it's a mob movie so let's cast someone from blue's clues who can't do anything but over overact with a big fake grin next let's cast the sullen brooding kid in the disney flick or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch br br i'd be interested in another filmmaker's take on this character and his story it's a shame imperioli has already been used up by this flick awful awful awful,0
3544,between the ages of 30 and 51 when he died of a brain tumour zachary scott made 70 films he was introduced in 1944 in jean 'the mask of where he played the next year 1945 he made three films of which this is one he is best remembered by cineastes as the star of jean renoir's 'the one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role however he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money so what happens here he lives in a house with three women so watch out faye emerson who also appeared in plays the older of two daughters in the house she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged then her kid' younger sister played effectively by mona freeman who resembles bonita granville both in looks and in behaviour returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a tidy sum so scott turns his sights on her instead with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse things get tense and then they get meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating scott but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story james wong howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale which was directed by frenchman robert florey who had moved to hollywood some time earlier the film is an effective psychopath in the house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an inclination,1
3545,i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time they were admittedly inferior question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure the kung fu craze had begun and bruce lee and ''the chinese would soon follow either that or ''the chinese with jimmy wang yu in any case this film was chosen to lead the way,0
3546,i don't know which was worse the viewer's made dopes of or the stars in this movie who look like dopes am i to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed the child was a bit dark am i to believe her mother her father and her husband never once said hmmm this child looks a bit dark am i to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records that lisa hartman had this wow look on her face when she told her mother christopher is half black what was that for real gee do you think so so not only did the grandmother and grandfather look dopey and stupid never once mentioning this but i guess we were supposed to look surprised and say hmmmmm omg he is half black totally stupid movie almost an embarrassment even to watch this,0
3547,this late ish effort from plays as a modern day 70's that is gothic thriller but comes out short of thrills certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film it's jut got that feeling which many of later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first it starts out good enough almost giallo like in tone then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent albeit terribly cliché set up then suddenly seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent to poor special effects this is followed by a slow paced with a very obvious twist ending if it's even intended to be a twist and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony thus in parts it's got its qualities but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you a pity br br btw stay away from the dvd a useless murky pan scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience,0
3548,i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975 some of the things you see today and take for granted in movie making were implemented in this movie the movie premise the costumes the special effects the acting it all was ahead of its time it opened the door for movies such as star wars the terminator the matrix and x men movies now people look at it and they say well this does not add up to this new special effects story it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days it did have a story and a wonderful cast and a hell of a director the places it was filmed like the world trade center and the building and the ft worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and it was my first film experience the first of six films i have been in just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art watch it again and appreciate it more this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy well my hand is blinking i got to run awaits,0
3549,low budget junk about bloodthirsty cultists in greece headed by peter cushing its up to priest donald pleasance to stop them crown international released this crap in 1978 and it was dog of the week on one of the episodes of sneak previews with gene siskel and roger ebert i forget which of the two dogged it but i see the point crappy movie has the worst peter cushing and donald pleasance performances i've ever seen there is a monster on the video box no such beast exists in the movie instead you get a statue but at least its correct woo hoo br br the cultists look like the klux klowns if a group could exist skip it,0
3550,i watch tons of movies and had no idea this would be as good as it was i was looking forward to it after reading the plot even though i find nirvana overrated it sounded like it would be tons of fun but it was more than that jansen puts in little touches like the books kubrick book among others movie posters etc i like when i see a director takes his time and put his heart into a film and you can really feel that in this there are tons of scenes and moments that i love i am trying to think now of some other films that are like this and i would say the only thing i can think of are cameron crowe films takes little moments and makes them stand out and special the soundtrack is amazing and each song works perfectly with the scenes and feel of the film this film is amazingly shot and the editing is outstanding i could really go on and on about the film i cannot recommend this enough really if you want a fun story with great tunes from a director who clearly put his heart into his work then check this out,1
3551,the marriage of an upscale new york city couple with child falls apart when the wife wants out it took a lot of courage for her to walk out that door a neighbor tells us the busy distracted husband takes on the motherly responsibilities and grows closer to his son but soon the wife returns highly manipulative picture doesn't give us a very realistic familial unit with young justin henry certainly not resembling the product of a marriage between dustin hoffman and meryl streep but the dynamics are intriguing and involving and director robert benton keeps the pace popping with lots of cleverness marvelous classical music canny editing and surefire bits of humor streep's character is designed to be a cold self centered witch but i was ready to feel a lot more for her than benton probably wanted it all has to be painted in terms of black and white good and bad with hoffman learning how hard his wife had it and getting a second chance at being a good parent the film never falters from its preconceived path and very fine acting nearly saves it but i'm not sure where benton was steering the film in the final act and the closing scene is awfully abrupt from,1
3552,the brilliance of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to each viewer in the audience this story is about success it's about failure it's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you the story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large no camera angle could cover it within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination keep this in mind as you watch the movie it's more than eye candy the sexually suggestive rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development,1
3553,this movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors that is the premise is interesting and i mean i rented it based on the synopsis the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept there is no coherent plot no fully fledged characters no real comedy no interesting scenery no surprises and no good performances except jon herder he does something with very little it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis and if there were enough people like me it may even have made money br br to the prospective viewer don't waste your time there is nothing funny or interesting to see here to the creators of the film hey you got your film made so what if its not that great most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen,0
3554,three children are born at the exact same time during a lunar eclipse just before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spree bloody birthday is a typical slasher from early 80's it's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity the evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense there is also no gore or scares in bloody birthday but the film is mildly entertaining unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania the murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we've got death by handgun baseball bat skipping rope and shovel so if you're a fan of early 80's slasher movies give this one a look,1
3555,tremendous fun both as a film and as an excuse to sit back and play the 'oh that's name' game every star of the golden age of english films seems to be in this one and it was a joy to see them and the greatest of them all richard was as tremendous as ever br br there is actually a plot that trundles along very nicely there's also some splendid jokes and comedic moments but the key to this films triumph is the characters within it alastair sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a six foot big boned scotsman could be the headmistress of a girl's boarding school george cole beryl reid and irene all have their moments but with alastair and richard the star of the show is joyce she is an absolute one off and brings a smile whenever she's on the screen her rolling walk and plum accent done to perfection br br and for those playing the that's name' game you can even spot arthur barbara windsor and ronald if you look carefully,1
3556,i was very concerned about this film it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival and was reported to be very hostile to israel while using clever humor and irony br br i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing the film was full of random events some of which eventually connected most of which did not some of the events were very clever and funny but some were merely random and pointless br br there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car and play some game perhaps in some cultures this is erotic but it's like watching thumb wrestling after the third time it really became tiresome br br i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work in fact there is nothing to grasp the same is true here the stories do not add up to anything and there is not much of a political point being made in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint that's news br br i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy nor why it has garnered attention it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time,0
3557,an opera diva has an accident which leaves the door open for her to take over the role betty is now the star of mac beth but someone hiding in the trenches has an opera of his own planned out he gets his kicks out of tying betty up putting needles under her eyes so she cant close them and murdering members of the opera company before her very eyes br br opera is certainly one of argento's more ambitious films like mixing it up with macbeth there is of course the fact that the opera performed in the film is giuseppe verdi's version of macbeth but also argento just like shakespeare uses ravens as an omen of death and misfortune and like the ravens circling the castle foreboding the demise of the scheming macbeth the ravens in opera play a key part in the downfall of the killer furthermore just like in the old play the murderer acts on the of his lover but i don't want to go as far as saying opera is intended to be a remake of the either the phantom of the opera or macbeth the similarities are far too subtle it's just a typical argento masterstroke and with it he gives this otherwise quite basic thriller a vivid hue of gothic mystique br br although this movie does have it downsides like the metal soundtrack just doesn't fit in with this movie and the final scenes in this movie are a bit strange br br all in all opera is something of a flawed masterpiece but still good,1
3558,what can i say about this film that won't give you any preconceived notions when you see it very little the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down what follows after that is the movie it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended it is not a perfect film the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story even more confused if you've read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere you'll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on i'm not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have if you like horror and don't mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl,1
3559,the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness br br interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways the story is too simplistic or rather presented in a simplistic way even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists for example people say they love each other after only two meetings i don't want to reveal anything else but you see what i mean if you watch the movie come on it was the fifties you may think yet i 've seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don't seem so dated nowadays br br something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark making it almost impossible to watch what was going on ok it's a film noir but this one is too noir at some points o br br overall the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era but no trash either watch it if you have nothing else to do,0
3560,if regarded as an independent feature i can't say it's too bad at all but from where i'm standing this sequel and the original lady and the tramp don't agree with each other they are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals e g the town house of jim dear darling lady and tramp and none of those have changed br br if you're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like bella notte and the cats song this sequel won't give you any at all just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters not to mention peg not appearing at all whose voices are quite annoying even lady and tramp don't appear often enough and as for scamp he is so spoilt and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he's being missed at home and they called his shameless getaway an adventure i'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal even the old characters just drive you mad in this trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed jock jeff stupid bennett and his voice sound neither scottish nor worth hearing zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb feather brained exasperating junkyard dogs somebody put them down br br lady and the tramp 2 isn't completely bad if you're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic scamp is so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline still i think you should try it at least once because as i say there are much worse movies around,0
3561,a mix of 70's drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line as i've often said about this flick if you don't get it you're way lame classic lines such as i've got this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times i do it you're a nurse what can you give me for it nurse replies all i have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring great sound track the classic hyde's got nothing to hide stays surprisingly close to the original plot not that the original stays in the way of a joke haven't met anyone with an iq over 115 that doesn't find it hysterical br br,1

3563,great acting great production values good direction br br but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered br br the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow through is weak for instance we're very clear that rudyard kipling is pro war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film br br this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea br br the depiction of the war itself is heart breakingly accurate though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time perhaps this is historically accurate like so much in this film i simply don't know,0
3564,the first question is how many talentless idiots it takes to screw a movie up answer one is more than enough if he writes the screenplay and directs it the second question is did anyone teach the actors to handle guns properly answer hell no i wonder if kristy swanson got hit across the face with hot brass because it damn seemed so the third question is how many times we did the super secret government agency conspiracy gets uncovered from inside plot answer a good couple too many the fourth question is are michael madsen and ron perlman overrated answer in this movie sadly yes the fifth question is can a pair of boobs save this movie answer even three kristy pair and the director writer didn't br br god if i see the most probably assassin getting her guns ready for a hit and then the morons from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie the suck meter hits the peak time from beginning of the movie to me switching the tv off fifteen minutes just a little bit more than it took me in case of alone in the dark,0
3565,i was turned on to this movie by my flight instructor and now i wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before i finally discovered it if you have any love of flying at all especially an attachment to the planes of wwii this is an absolute must see vastly superior to the pathetic pearl harbor and up there in rivalry with the famed battle of britain filmed more than thirty years ago there are moments when you feel as if you are flying literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a me 109 or he 111 br br as an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant poles hungarians and czechs who in 1939 1940 fled their homelands made it to england fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization and then were so callously abandoned by us after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands i have stood atop monte in italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the polish troops that stormed that mountain that british and americans could not take i have traveled as well to prague the most beautiful of cities and studied their history their story of abandonment i believe should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies br br but back to the film if you love flying see this if you are interested in the aircraft of wwii most definitely see it without doubt the most brutal direct and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film and yes if you even are seeking a touching romance there is that as well in heartbreaking detail br br bill professor of history co owner of a wwii replica p 51 mustang gloria ann,1
3566,this is probably wayne's poorest movie at least the poorest in which he had a starring role it's just incredibly bad the editing is especially awful it really appears that the editor if there was one literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together the opening has to be seen to be believed john wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned i know there are b films but are there h films if so this one's an example and i say this as a devoted fan,0

3568,i love this movie a lot i must get this on dvd i have 2 vhs copies but the quality is so poor that you can't read one written joke over the door of the ward i'm forever amazed that blankfield did almost nothing afterward he made both dr and mr hyde totally believable br br the movie is plagued by it's low budget one atrocious edit jumps into mid word and was described on siskel ebert but there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate i often find myself quoting lines or singing i've got nothing to hide and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches some conversation there are at least six scenes which are among my all time favorite comedy bits br br viewers with no history of cocaine use may miss a lot of gags br br here take it visual of driving while waving butt out the window i said 'is this seat taken ' nice burn visual of chaps headdress swim fins yeah i'm right handed me me says the woman trying to sell bernie's going to love these that's my feet jack says the black feet why should we tell you she's at the supermarket ivy on supermarket pa loading whole shopping cart into ambulance etc,1
3569,i first saw this movie when i was about 12 years old it has been one of my favorites since it's so perfect in all it's glory complete with awesome soundtrack cheesy dialog and it was both hilarious and terribly sad the first movie i really just had a fit about at the end i won't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker i just remember feeling so sad for gary what a bunch of cool characters in this movie it's genius they are all so great even the nerdy girl gary doesn't like she had a nice little body though i can't believe all the girls go for rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ha ha ha when watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases almost but a love story at heart with real problems dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast i love this movie if you like valley girl another all time classic you will too,1

3571,footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize psychological thriller is the most appropriate description i can think of the female protagonist alice discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days the only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel she is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago in her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before this is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end the unusual loneliness of the main character and the of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well the important part of the one and only everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of italian horror is an extra bonus,1
3572,man is it great just to see young and the restless star melody thomas scott as something other than flighty nikki newman a doctor with a brain no less and super nice to see her with the likes of the gorgeous lorenzo lamas instead of victor newman br br mel plays a college professor of micro biology who goes to the islands with her son for spring break only to find herself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus handy for her there is the hunky character played by lorenzo who has a daughter just her son's age br br mel shines as does lorenzo with a bit of the overacting from the younger couple interesting premise in these times of chemical and biological terrorism talk worthwhile seeing especially for y r fans,1
3573,it kept me on the edge of my seat true the story has a few plot holes but the sheer tension of it the way the director just keeps challenging the premise is simply fascinating br br josé and adriana are two of spain's best actors see la vida mancha and héctor and here they appear as a happy upper middle class couple beneath it all the truth is that all of life is a lie he's not an economist never went to college or does not work in spain's central bank reserve as everybody else believes we get a few insights as to how he kept up appearances or manage to do it and while not very plausible it is still somehow believable br br the inner workings of the scam are shown intermittently but it is credible because is a source of self assurance and assertiveness he not only believes in the scam he also believes in the film premise and therefore he carries it br br sure it tests belief that a wife would not know the inner workings of a marriage's finances for almost 10 years but again since he's supposedly a brilliant economist br br it has been said in a nationalistic tone that the movie is not distinctively spanish as if that were a litmus test for good film true no or odd in this one just a taut thriller you'll want to know how this story ends once you start watching,1
3574,having seen the full length film kieslowski made out of this episode of the decalogue years ago came back to this viewer as we watched the complete ten vignettes as with the other films this one is loosely based on the fifth commandment or thou shalt not kill br br kieslowski writing with took a look at the mind of a young man who commits a heinous crime in murdering an innocent person to vent his own frustrations this installment has a dostoyevskian character that kept reminding us about crime and punishment or at least some of the qualities of the novel are passed to the aimless youth who apparently has no redeeming qualities br br the story shows the young man as he roams the streets of the city without a clear idea of what to do or where to go the only tender moment he displays is when he visits the photographer's place to ask to have an old picture of his sister restored kieslowski leaves it up to fate to have the murderer board a taxi with the intention of robbing the driver but it's his anger and frustration that get the best of this youth to kill a man that didn't deserve to die the last moments of this criminal is one of the most gripping sequences in any film past or present br br the other element in the story is the relationship between the public defendant and the criminal nothing can prevent the court to condemn to death the young man the lawyer feels at the end he has failed his client and goes to the judge to see where he went wrong all he is asked by the young man is to retrieve the picture and send it to his mother br br kieslowski's account of how he interprets the fifth commandment makes for a surprising film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after this episode is forgotten,1
3575,this is as good as it gets br br this is six episodes tracing briefly what life may have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth done in the style of a nature documentary this show does away with talking heads instead just gives us the good stuff with the dinosaurs attempting to survive br br certainly this isn't a true documentary since none of what we see on screen can be attested to with any certainty but its a best guess and an entertaining one at that here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people this is a show that should be shown to any kid who loves dinosaurs since it will instill them with the oh wow factor to go out and find out more it will also entertain the hell out of them and you br br see this if you love animal shows or nature or science or disney true life adventures except no one really gets killed or just a really good trip to somewhere else run out and get yourself a copy your brain will thank you,1
3576,this movie is an example of small budget ineffective star cast weak storyline and poor entertainment this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die hard fans of bollywood movies i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das she is good sexy and acting well she definitely go up in her career our was all time good at his work atleast he has some good to the movie i didn't like for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie,0
3577,i really wanted to like this movie because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved ghouls another of films it did have some almost good moments like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure but on the whole it was just boring and mildly unpleasant br br the unimaginable shocks that came up with were really predictable and worn out poop murdering prostitutes incest could have still been good but poorly done unsure whether it was trying to offend amuse or both ultimately did neither br br in conclusion we watch troma movies because we want films with heart this film did not consistently feel like it had heart there were some good scenes but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant,0
3578,the sf premise isn't unique although it pretty much was back then but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the sf premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who don't have to lie to be unhelpful instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable world br br in part two we follow the main character's struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation he knows his very existence is nothing more than electrical impulses how does he deal with this knowledge he knows that there is a world that is more real than his but he is trapped in an artificial world a world where nobody can understand him the problem of thinking of knowing something essential about the world that nobody else knows or wants to believe is a very real one that many of us can identify with for me the film transports this hopelessness very well with its dreary artificial atmosphere which also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world br br other than 'the matrix' or 'the thirteenth it's little concerned with evoking a sense of awe for its artificial reality plot instead it very much focuses on the psychological aspects philosophy is only in so far interesting in that certain philosophical concepts are essential in how they shape and alter the character's perception of the world br br arguably it is longer than it has to be which isn't a problem if you are as captivated by it as i was and part 2 runs pretty low on steam,1
3579,the snow queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by hans christian andersen about a girl gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend kai from the clutches of the snow queen this adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of counts br br like so many hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy handed scripting and direction the two actors playing gerda and kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable bridget fonda as the snow queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role there's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three hour miniseries at least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters br br that said the snow queen would be just about ideal for pre teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience it's great eye candy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over the top level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text just make sure you read them andersen's story too,0
3580,the third part of miike's dead or alive trilogy is as unrelated to the first two parts as they were to each other more or less show and riki are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future post apocalypse br br riki plays a tough cop an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies and show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels the film must have been shot in hong kong as most of the rest of the cast are cantonese speakers with terence yin and josie ho being the most recognisable faces there's also a hk stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a hk via miike style br br this could be fodder for a dreadful low budget b movie but in miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting it's quite a slow thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on br br all in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show miike's increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action watching the short making of with show riki in wire rigs is really fun you can tell they were having a great time br br the finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 dead or alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though and caps the series off quite nicely br br not as deep or well developed as not as outrageous and intense as still another good miike movie though,1
3581,when i fist watched the movie i said to myself so a film can be made like this wong kar wai's gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film i must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all i have ever watched the content and the form overlaps perfectly as watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable i want to congratulate christopher doyle and pin bing lee for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love also the music defines the sadness of the love which plays along the beautiful slow motion frames and shows the characters in despairing moods and of course the performances of the actors which makes the love so real eventually all the elements in the film combined in a perfect way under the direction of wkw and give the audience the feeling called love,1
3582,well i just discovered imdb from my twin sister carol carol and i played the fat identical twin in midnight madness we didn't have to prepare much for the fat part that came with us and well and the rest was natural it was our first major film role and we had a blast making it we were 21 at the time and lived about an hour and half from the disney studio in burbank and the hollywood california area we grew up in front of the tv and probably some of the first generation of latch key kids twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or what ever is politically correct these days we don't pursue acting any more but have been know to 'come back' when the right opportunity arrives carol is a chiropractor in our home town of southern california and i am in the information technology field in georgia br br i maybe bias but i thought the film was cute clean and fun we knew it wasn't a master piece or an oscar nominee however it was and still is a movie the whole family can watch and have fun together it's nice not to have to worry if your young children can watch a video without having to fast forward certain parts and no one was more exited when it was released on video as carol and i were carol found it at kmart for 6 99 now that's an inexpensive way to capture one's memories and share it with others br br sincerely betsy lynn and carol the thompson twins,1
3583,if you're a child of the eighties like me you probably remember this 1981 disney movie one of disney's first pg rated films and michael j fox's screen debut i can remember watching this film over and over on hbo when i was on middle school and i only recently found a very old copy of it since disney stopped producing the movie several years ago needless to say this is a real fun movie to watch five college teams decipher clues in an evening race around los angeles trying to reach the finish line first watch for the cameo from paul reubens from the cheesy music to the disco scene with the fat twins this is a quintessential 1980s fun film that you'll love,1
3584,this is sweet the actress who played the nurse with the is the same actress who plays elvira mistress of the dark another little tidbit is the actress who played the nurse who would give her wedding ring was the landlord lady of roy in king pin this is most glorious story ever to be told it should sell more copies than the bible my parents played a part in suggesting the release of this movie to a local movie theater the movie ran for a week and we were one of 4 families to see it the lady who gave the go ahead friend of the family was let go by the theater i was 3 years old i have burned through 4 copies on vhs and finally had it converted to dvd it's beautiful,1
3585,if you like really shocking movies this is for you the acting is the worst i've ever seen and the story line goes no where if you come across this film in your video shop don't even consider borrowing it the chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie i gave this movie 1 10 only because i couldn't vote 0 avoid it at all costs,0
3586,it's hard for me to explain this show to my grown friends i have a bunch of daisy's in the back yard which i lovingly call my chuckle patch my friends laugh at me and look at me like i have 2 heads it would be great to see this series on dvd for us folks who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch where kids tv today is compiled of violent cartoons characters who do magic or a talking sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea the magic garden was real in the respect that it taught us good values br br i will hold fond memories of carole and paula and the chuckle patch,1
3587,even the maria montez jon hall baubles of the '40s are eclipsed by princess of the nile fox's entry in hollywood's mid '50s obsession with things egyptian see land of the valley of the kings etc pure unadulterated mindless hokum lavishly produced low budgeted actually but using sets and costumes left over from the robe this spectacle looks like it cost millions 71 minutes of eye candy the plot having something to do with nefarious do in ancient egypt is beside the point offers the cinematographer and audiences the delectable sight of debra paget wearing an assortment of see thru veils most of which hit the ground when she shakes and thru a slave girl production number unparalleled in film history female moviegoers were not shortchanged fox's handsomest young contract player jeffrey hunter is as photogenic as ms paget while michael rennie lurks around in the background stirring up evil doings in the land of the pyramids for those who might think paget hunter can't act and were only hired for their physical attributes check out their subtle overlooked heartbreaking work together a few years later in white feather another fox production that has sadly vanished into the realm of lost films princess of the nile still stands in a class by itself as a cheerfully mindless breathlessly fast paced dazzling testament to the glories of 3 strip technicolor and the seductive charms of ms paget all of 20 at the time put this one of a kind kitsch classic at the top of your guilty pleasures list and enjoy satisfaction guaranteed,1
3588,negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times everyone in this movie should attend anonymous you would think an original story could evolve from the general concept young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing it does raise interesting questions but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke the typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd glasses included i could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and cliché characters upon the completion of the movie i had to throw the dvd in the trash stay far away from this dud you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back,0
3589,alright so maybe the impersonations of jay leno and david letterman are not spot on but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen bob balaban and treat williams are as warren littlefield and micheal br br the movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny kathy bates in particular is amazing as leno's manager br br funny amazing interesting very watchable this is a good tv movie,1
3590,it's the single unfunniest thing i ever watched it's sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny he is the most bitter person i ever saw his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn't care and by that only showing how much he's angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who'd rather go through immense torture than go watch his show there are good comedians there are bad ones and there are horrible ones but this guy is in a league of his own i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny,0
3591,there are just so many things wrong with this movie br br jeff bridges weird accent br br rita's ability to crack the password code br br the entire script br br the ending esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher j r laugh and say we don t drink coffee anymore well why did they order it then they obviously did if they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees br br total tosh,0
3592,i would give this a zero if they had that rating fun was no fun at all i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better it did not the others i watched this movie with also agreed the acting was annoying i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting the supporting cast was no better while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way i actually disliked the leading characters dick and jane so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot a worthless movie and a total waste of time,0
3593,i was mighty impressed with nurse betty all the way through it has a great ensemble of characters an origional plot and an ending i shoulda seen coming but didn't and pulls at your heart strings br br if theres any one thing about this movie that got me the most it was morgan freeman and chris rock's interaction these two are great and it warms my heart to see rock isn't going to do crappy big hollywood fare like lethal weapon 4 for the rest of his life freeman is as always the man really there shouldnt be any need to critique his work anymore hell kiss the girls was watchable with him in it br br renee does the best she can with her role and kinnear is good as her br br sweet movie with a nice touch of gratuitous violence in it to satisfy the bloodlust of the male 9 outa 10 br br,1
3594,it was dumb sort of like an adam sandler movie br br there were a few funny parts but not that funny br br i liked some of the actors in it though br br there were some sat night live people in the movie but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie,0
3595,i bought this film as i thought the cast was decent and i like jennifer rubin patsy kensit br br first off let me say the acting is not of a high standard stephen baldwin makes his character look almost retarded at times and at other times morose patsy kensit is so so but not too convincing in some scenes and the supposed poetry she spouts in a particular scene in her hotel room is utterly meaningless rubbish ms kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy here but ultimately i think jennifer rubin is by far the best in this film ms character is at first innocent then sexy as she plays stephen baldwin's character travis for a fool the supporting cast includes adam baldwin no relation to his more famous m walsh who has appeared in many films also i noticed art evans who was one of john allies in die hard 2 the movie is decent and there are a few nude scenes with rubin kensit a bit of action but this is certainly not a fast moving or intelligent thriller there is a particular scene when they are in the car about to commit a crime and stephen character is wearing sunglasses and when you see him again the area around his eyes etc is painted black instead then the sunglasses reappear later when they are leaving the crime scene and police are in pursuit a very obvious error in editing br br if you are fans of either of the ladies or either baldwin then you may find something to like here but others should steer clear this is a reasonable but unremarkable thriller and not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it,0
3596,i'm new to gaming but i would have started much sooner if this film had been around i caught it at gen con last year a trip made only as a favor to my husband and loved it even to a non gamer like i was at the time it's funny and accessible so much so that i finally relented and started sitting in on my husband's gaming group br br i don't want to give away any plot details but if you're a gamer you need to see this film and if you're not you're going to have a great time despite yourself there are certainly in jokes but the vast majority of the film is accessible to anyone br br my only complaints wish it were longer and wish it were available on dvd soon perhaps,1
3597,this line is a good summary of this movie if you have read it and watched 20 minutes of the movie you will know exactly how the rest of the movie is going to behave some researcher named pronounced are searching for hell in the underworld of moscow however he seems to have disappeared and his friend oven follows with a team to search after him could they have find a more boring plot some bad actors looking after an old man in the underground the acting is very bad the romance really feels pointless and untrue often there is no good reason for the way the characters are acting nothing is scary and most of all there's not happening anything interesting in the whole entire movie they just walk asking some gang leaders and other guys about the way walk some more complain some finds the old man and then they run and finally finds the way out of the underground br br the only thing that provides me from giving this movie the lowest of all ratings is the atmosphere if you just want to see a movie for that this may be a good choice it's dark and it's mystical and murky however the rest of the movie is really dull you just sit there all the time waiting for the movie to begin or something to happening it's actually happening some things but they are not very well performed for example i didn't really notice when one of the characters disappeared and i swear i wasn't sleeping or something and i don't understand what's dangerous with these children they just run around in the underground together scratching it walls with sticks i suppose it is meant to be scary in some way br br just watch this movie if you are in immediate need of some murky atmospheres,0
3598,the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence but it is not good at all one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies the film is sad not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast if it were redone and written over it could be awesome if you want a good movie to see stoned watch grandma's boy or half baked or dazed and confused but this is not a movie to be seen at all,0
3599,i think this movie is my favorite movie i am not sure why but it is julia duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile and when i saw this i went crazy it's sort of romantic and i definitely recommend this movie,1
3600,this is possibly one of the worst movies i have had the dis pleasure of watching in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people i watched this film with 3 friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end ben kingsley's character is just plain stupid but not funny at all it is a wonder why an actor of his talent would be involved in such tripe tea leoni does a fine hillary clinton impression throughout to portray the very cold and uninteresting female lead who has all the endearing qualities of a broom handle throw in a pointless and unexplained sub plot and a horribly cringe worthy montage and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes 60 in my case avoid this film at all costs,0
3601,i don't know what some people were thinking when they said this movie was bad it was great classic bruce campbell yes it was low budget and the special effect showed this but that is not what you see a bruce movie for you watch it for bruce also ted was excellent i found this movie hilarious and entertaining i still crack up when i recall bruce on that pink moped now i will admit this movie is not for everyone if you don't like b movies you probably won't like this one if you crave big budget effects and actors steer clear but if you like slap stick and off the wall sci fi plots this movie is for you br br hail the king baby,1
3602,i like to like movies but i found nothing to like about the box i was interested in the of the plot but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something well i have news for them the emperor has no clothes br br the only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin and corrupting mankind i've heard that story before and it makes less and less sense every time it's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price,0
3603,a group of teens have their car break down in the middle of nowhere they seek shelter in a farmhouse but three murderous convicts are there killing the owner of said farmhouse and his family one of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow cue blood gore carnage bad acting better than the first but only by default i still wouldn't wish it on my arch enemy bob in the end the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we us americans are killing and our forests huh ok whatever buddy dude i'd rather chop down forests then have my braincells diminish and my grey matter leak out of my ears in other words become a simple minded idiot liberal br br my grade d,0
3604,this is a beautiful yet simple movie about one man driven to find an answer an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around it is heartrending it is hilarious it is glorious it is tormenting it is delicate and dynamic i say it's genius br br i have read jonathan safran book everything is illuminated mainly because i heard elijah wood was starring in the movie adaptation and i was just enraptured by the characters i laughed out loud more than once and every time someone talks about what it's about i hear the same hackneyed response almost like it's one big long word yet this story is so philosophical it goes deeper than that that conversation about the ring and in case it really gets one thinking suddenly this story merges from a simple quest to an inner metamorphosis and i find myself looking at things a bit differently now br br i recommend renting this before if ever reading it because the book had many obscene downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie mainly the history of jonathan's family that was not necessary for the film br br a bit of trivia i heard is that wood's current girlfriend has a cameo in this flick as the drummer in the band that alex arranges to perform as jonathan steps off the train into ukraine br br you spend half of the movie trying to figure out what it's about exactly and what jonathan is about because his character is so withdrawn like a turtle in a shell br br it is magnificent and in my opinion one of elijah wood's best movies,1
3605,what a film quite possibly the best i've ever seen the direction the production the score and the cinematography wonderful the acting is also excellent and the man robot scenes have to be seen to be i can not recommend this film enough get it out on video now turn the lights down and enjoy,1
3606,sex is a most noteworthy aspect of existence it is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death le de americain studies human sexuality in a dry and boring manner actually worse than being simply boring seeing nude 40 year olds is well unpleasant br br i guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex but after twenty minutes this stops being interesting perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger the film would be more visually captivating br br le de americain is not worth the time,0
3607,i have seen chasing the dragon several times and have enjoyed it each time the acting was superb this movie really makes you realize how one bad choice at a weak moment can change your life,1
3608,and is an entertaining fast paced and refreshing film refreshing because unlike most other period films it does not strive to give the audience a history lesson or preach indeed historical accuracy is all but ignored this film does not take itself too seriously and seeks to entertain rather than enlighten and is set in the 18th century yet director jake scott offers a thoroughly 90s take there's action sex and swearing aplenty and in the inevitable ball scene the aristocracy dance to disco beats jonny lee miller and robert carlyle are brilliant as always and the rest of the cast especially alan cumming as a flirtatious fop are also highly entertaining the film is visually spectacular in places and is a mixture of comedy action and drama with a love interest provided by liv tyler with a shaky english accent in short if you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours this is the film for you it won't make you think but it could well put a smile on your face,1
3609,i hate to be too critical but this one really was bad i like the baldwin brothers i just wish there was more talent evenly spread between them i did like the general plot but there was just too much and not enough actual as far as quality acting was concerned br br my favorite character out of the whole thing was bald cop he reminded me of jeremy roberts i believe from start trek 6 undiscovered country just without the hair br br if you have hollywood video's mvp program and are really trying to get your money's worth then through this in with one of the three mvp movies you pick up it's worth it for a few laughs br br the single most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of stephen baldwin's rifle firing i suppose that lets you in a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show,0
3610,i shouldn't like jackass number two no one should there is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about jackass and yet it's one of the funniest things i have ever seen and i simply cannot explain why br br this new movie leaves the first one in the dust it's so funny so horrible and so wrong the whole team give their all with in chief knoxville leading the charge he's nuts i adore him but he's insane and more power to him with his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the so wholeheartedly makes me oddly respect him more kudos must go to bam who previously seemed content to sit back and just make sure everyone around him did pretty much what he wanted here bam isn't the tormentor but the tormented and is all the better for it br br i simply can't say what my favourite part is because i laughed the whole way through admittedly i viewed much of the movie from between my fingers but there hasn't been a 'real' movie i've seen in a very long time that made me feel as invigorated as this did love them or most probably hate them the jackass team have delivered above and beyond my expectations but i do agree with bam there can never be a jackass number three because someone will die and i want these guys to stick around,1
3611,i managed to record the dion brothers off broadcast tv with the commercials back in the early 80s i've loaned it to many friends all of whom agree it's one of the best b bandit movies ever made one day while walking to my nyc apartment i saw stacy keach shooting a scene for his tv series mickey we had a moment to chat and i told him how much i enjoyed the dion bros and considered it a pure classic he thanked me and said it was one of the best and most memorable film experiences of his career he was very friendly and sincere and i was grateful for the few moments he took to chat with a fan this is one classic that needs to be on dvd,1
3612,great music great dancing a sexy star swayze and actual sexual desire shown by a female character a very unusual event you rarely see female characters who are motivated primarily by lust and it is a nice change i also think the movie captures very well what it is like to be a teenager coping with issues of class and of having ideals suddenly come up against reality of course it is sappy at moments it is after all a movie musical but all in all it is a real pleasure a fun romance and also politically enlightened this movie also has one of my favorite all time movie lines i carried the watermelon,1
3613,too predictable for spoilers but i'll not be cagey below so don't read it if you care br br a few dull scriptwriters together for half an afternoon and even then they run out of ideas so let's start with a criminal sought by all france doesn't matter what he has done we'll think of that later they don't some seconds of suspense but not too much and nothing unexpected because that requires art half an hour needed to finish off the film i get it have them rob a and take a lot of time avoiding alarms etc everybody robs jewellers in films just ike this it's bound to work it doesn't no humour no character ok yves montand does get to ham it a weeny bit and have everyone speak in a quiet deadpan voice that is supposed to make one think of noir but merely makes the actors sound depressed if they are silent it'll make them seem grimmer but also save us writing their lines we'd better add something for the stay at home women who are going to watch this stuff so let's have something to make them empathise with hubby we forgot to put any women in the film got it a son on gasp marijuana oh and have him attempt suicide for no particular reason shame his dad's a mafia boss for crying out loud but the audience will feel his fatherly care and if not sod them oh the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who gets him in the end wrenching eh let's have them all die at the end or we'll never finish this stuff is it in the can right that's over with then thank god who'll we get for director,0
3614,i think did her evil part very well she should have won an award anything that dunne is in is salvageable because dunne is a great actress and can pull anything off even a weak script therefore i would recommend it for this reason alone this movie may have been a little ahead of it's time the plot might be more acceptable these days br br during the golden age of hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times this plot seem to deviate from that profile yet again i must say what ever irene dunne was in at least was good because she made things so believable the only other actress i can say made me think this way was maybe deborah kerr watch silver cord if you get the chance for the acting if nothing else,1
3615,star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br danny mel is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother maxine but after an altercation with said daughters present at a working men's club he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at louis colin salmon and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher more assertive person before long he's taken the philosophies of louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 80s disco faze kicks in but when associate sparky scott williams tries to do a sideline in drug dealing everything turns pear shaped br br as robert de niro once stated in the film a bronx tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent ' the writer of clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film but without the ability it seems to put it all together into some sort of coherent film br br as a brummie some of the filming locations especially a scene at the end outside the ring o' bells pub in moseley were quite easy and fun to spot but the dour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things some really poor acting for instance lead actor with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though more established actors like and even telly favourite neil are sidelined to very small supporting parts while the disastrous and ronnie fox's lame villain take centre stage williams does a poor man's sick boy from trainspotting impression leaving salmon and shaun parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing as the excessive blood splattered violence becoming a common trend for brit flicks takes over truly a missed opportunity,0
3616,i will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when i saw it for the first time from the moment that the major is startled by the clown to his anguished attempts to make sense of the situation we're alive we're people we must have memories quote but close to his clever attempt to improvise a means of escape this is riveting drama br br little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it the moment when the lovely ballerina dances for everyone to the off key screeching bagpipes of the scottish musician the wistful remark a miss is as good as a mile the shaken conclusion that they must be in hell br br this is a brilliant episode beautifully written and acted the breathtaking beauty of susan harrison adds to the of the strange touching story,1
3617,comparing oceans twelve to the 2001 oceans eleven did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same br br all the stars returned for twelve and zeta jones was added br br twelve had the same director br br twelve had the same producers br br twelve had the same production designer br br twelve had the same music director br br twelve had the same film editor br br did anyone notice the things than changed once the oceans franchise was established br br twelve's budget was 25 million 30 greater br br eleven got great reviews but twelve largely got panned br br eleven made 450 million but twelve dropped to million br br domestic box office for twelve dropped 32 br br soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter br br movies are a director's medium of course i almost forgot,0
3618,ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work br br first put in loads of hillbilly truckers good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion br br now mix all together and what have you got br br you guessed it one very mediocre movie,0
3619,it is now clear that the true golden age of american film was from the mid 60s until just before the release of star wars before then there was too much hays code constricted pap with star wars the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons a practice which continues to this day the seven ups truth be told contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one but i'm damned if i can find anything else wrong with it in fact that line may not even have been stale when this film was made the seven ups demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age sparse dialogue realistic acting real locations winter in a dirty new york has never looked better worse stories and yes the best car chase ever filmed bill hickman is the driver scheider is chasing you will recognize him from bullitt and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the mcqueen one but i prefer scheider's facial intensity here the pacing the terrific close ups of the schoolchildren and the shattering conclusion that vw bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the bullitt chase a stringy screechy score by don ellis sets the perfect mood the seven ups bleak grim action oriented grown up this is a film that couldn't be made today there's no gimmick for the kiddies or preposterous ending thank you philip roy scheider and tony lo bianco for as long as cop films are watched the seven ups and its 1970s brethren e g the french connection will set the standard,1
3620,a true stand out episode from season 1 is what ice is an artic location claustrophobic conditions and a general feel of paranoia looming in the freezing air makes this is a must see episode from season one the previous occupants of the artic station mulder scully and four others go to have either killed each other or killed themselves a virus is bringing out murderous aggression and is responsible for bringing out deadly paranoia and fear mulder and scully actually begin to question each others sanity tension is that high the writers have to receive great credit for creating that sort of scenario where the atmosphere is so tense mulder and scully come into conflict in such a direct manner,1
3621,has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a scene by scene remake of the 1933 version with some of the scenes taken out it makes me think less of a film that does that showing a definite want of creativity in all fairness i tend to be biased in favor of katharine hepburn but this version of the film seems like cinematic plagiarism the 1933 version was nice and sweet though a little awkward in presentation and transition at times and then this version took the script the music and even a fair amount of the scene blocking from the earlier version i don't understand the point of making the film again when the method of remaking it was to basically redo george cukor's film with everything the same except the people working on it,0
3622,i'd have to agree with the previous reviewer this film has awesome animation but has problems throughout the rest of the movie br br plot holes are huge dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot the main plot points aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film the characters state the obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film there are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained most of them have names that are only mentioned once and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you are in it for a good laugh and how dumb it is,0
3623,a huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track i can't say it was riveting entertainment nor a cure for insomnia nevertheless i enjoyed the film it provided the escape i was after one afternoon a good look for those of us looking for the ideal life albeit a fantasy expect some corny moments few thrills and an occasional laugh,1
3624,words can scarcely describe this movie loaded with ridiculous stereotypes a silly plot and poor music this movie lacks in just about every category br br don't be fooled by the imdb credits this is not a michael dorn movie he's a secondary character in the grand scheme br br also listed in the credit's is an actor named prince which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as then again i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that br br big summary bunch of teams one has kidneys one has 35 000 one has an illegal substance and one has 350 000 add some confusion and as to who needs to meet who revenge on being taken and such and you end up with this mess of a movie br br given a choice i'd pass on this movie,0
3625,but had to see just how bad it could get the plotline was thin to begin with but it just kept getting worse a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated to artificially create a male because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97 of the worldwide male population the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'lesbian the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello press a few buttons and ding you get a baby not only that but he will age to mid 20's in a month and then begin to age normally how convenient eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to 'see the city' br br this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved as adam quickly learns what men did survive are treated as outcasts criminals because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence the propaganda machines have been in full swing scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers this has led to lesbianism being the norm the fall of christianity female only reproduction via cloning and oh yeah world peace among other implied results all of which seem unlikely given that only 30 years had elapsed since the war adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next all the while being genetically programmed to be non violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf with the fbi on his trail looking for fresh meat and his creator trying to recapture him for herself it seems he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all br br all in all i would not recommend this movie br br i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her' director of the fbi and julie bowen didn't do bad as hope the geneticist either,0
3626,this was a sleeper for sure much better than i thought never realizing it was a horror flick and who was this gorgeous voiced hunk named vin diesel adding spice and intrigue to this otherwise film the monsters in this film were quite unusual not the same ol run of the mill gobble you up types the ending was great too for a change not all bad guys are bad i give it 2 thumbs up,1
3627,i'm a horror movie freak and this has got to be one of the most phenomenal horror flicks i've ever seen the plotline is totally original who else would think up a town who gets totally obsessed with a certain symbol to the point of death and insanity the special effects are amazing and the cinematography couldn't be better some may find it disturbing but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie it also makes a good point the spiral symbol is kinda ubiquitous the spiral notebook spiral spirals on cakes of all the shapes they could have used square triangle rectangle this was one of the best choices if you can find this movie definitely see it it's certainly unique and quite unforgettable,1
3628,this film is the most romantic in years david duchovny is superb make you cry smile and dream minnie driver and james belushi are very good too but david is astonish don´t miss the opportunity to see this little film and fall in love with bob and grace run don´t walk,1
3629,right this moment i am watching this movie on tv here in tokyo beautiful scenery beautiful sets of biblical proportions beautiful costumes beautiful color beautiful gina great climactic scene when god destroys the idol and a lot more with de at the moment when yul and gina are about to consummate their love yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines though he sounds a lot like yul delivering his lines as or george sanders sounds like george sanders playing george sanders given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role gina does a good job though by the time the movie ends she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of mother teresa i guess will do that to you but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion the supporting players are mostly awful lacking credible emotion and timing the usual big battle scenes what passed for lascivious dances in 1959 and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of but none of it quite of topnotch hollywood quality the final swordfight between brynner and sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play the film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more,0
3630,i got seriously ripped off with this purchase the other posters pretty well cover the failings of this poor poor film my dvd that i purchased actually had the 1978 piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for that film on the front by joe etc i was really disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc i am actually a fan of lots of bad movies there is always something funny or at least amusing on most of them somewhere not this film i am actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar dvd just for the principle of the thing blatant false packaging here easily the worst movie of all time no redeeming factors at all boring not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is seriously,0
3631,i gave this film my rare 10 stars br br when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn't br br this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel nanny crosby a strong beautiful inside and out black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna br br highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950's prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community br br in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era,1
3632,i was a marine at camp pendleton when the d i came out 1st marine division 11th marine regiment 3rd battalion i battery i still remember standing in line with a bunch of other marines to see the movie at the star theater in california br br we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was the idea of using real marines in the movie was a great idea i believe they were all real drill instructors too as good an actor as jack webb was he just couldn't call cadence like a real marine drill instructor br br all of us got a laugh when the problem mother came to boot camp to talk to the captain never in a million years would this have happened but that's hollywood and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie br br i went through boot camp at in san diego during the summer of 1956 and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the d i 's could do to you the ribbon creek event at parris island had not yet affected boot camp at least not at san diego br br i agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning sgt moore's stiffness around his girl friend i believe this was just webb's acting style and although they could have deleted this part of the movie it didn't really hurt the production that much br br one minor note the character uncredited of pvt rodriguez was played by one of my drill instructors sgt peter j o'neill sgt o'neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor we secretly laughed at this but he surprised us all he was a great drill instructor and i thought he did well in his bit part also he really did enjoy throwing knives he often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp i have often wondered if he is still alive,1
3633,i grew up watching the bowery boys on the weekends and even at young an age i could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies still it was fun to watch hall get the better of gorcey after would beat the crap out him the east side kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch enter the year 2005 and i am about my childhood i can't find any bowery boys on dvd but i found the east side kids on disc and also on a public domain website thankfully i saved my dough and saw bowery blitz on the web for free and it really really blows now i can see there are some bowery boys and maybe monogram bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks this ain't even trying to be funny it's an east side kids drama not a comedy so it's no good the best part was seeing fight at the end he reminded me of my grade school days away like a girl when i would get in a fight it was kinda leonard maltin said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones so you can just imagine the rest if you wanna see some halfway decent east side action see ghosts on the loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and tapers off these mugs blew chucks early on then slowly picked it up until hall's antics dominated than they were at best still 2nd tier stuff way below the 3 stooges who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them this feature won't bring back pleasant bowery boys memories and is best left to monogram fanatics,0
3634,i really enjoyed the film it was really cheesy at times they destroy the villain with hair but where are they plugged in it's a unique film though and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope i also enjoyed however you write it liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb besides the acting the rewinding and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting i saw it twice and i'd see it again,0
3635,the lubitsch's touch is more than ever in this film humour at anytime and very subtle the plot is simple but turned in a delicious way by the director the film cut is very clever and add to the comic effect a real piece of comedy that isn't getting so old for a century spectator the character are finely acted by gary cooper and especially claudette colbert so smart and mean with this poor micheal in the movie she avoid every traps from her husband and turn the situation to her advantage very funny and no problem with lubitsch there is always an happy end a film for men too confident with women don't let your girlfriend watch this movie,1
3636,the movie was slow the dialogue between actors actresses felt flat and basically there was no development of the characters in the story br br omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody danes has no on screen magic and ribisi's character is a that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so br br throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history br br i watched it on satellite thank goodness i didn't pay for it and wished i hadn't br br do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when if it comes on your tv awful movie if you ask me and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there,0
3637,having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas i had to watch it i did not expect much which usually means i get more than i bargained for but utter utter cr i like abba i like the songs i have the old lps but this film is just terrible the stage show looks like a bit of a musical but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another no characterisation the dance numbers which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard's musicals in the sixties meryl see me i'm acting streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over the top musical her grand piece 'the winner takes it all' is meryl at the met note to director it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv one can never settle down and just enjoy the music enthusiasm and characters but what is even worse is how this botched piece of has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot blair campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies critical faculties anyone,0
3638,there is a version of nevsky that is shown with a live symphony orchestra chorus soloist and the movie if it's ever performed within a day's travel of you see nevsky done that way the oklahoma city philharmonic did it with the choir one of the finest anywhere a couple of years ago i think i cried through the whole thing it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life i'm listening to nevsky on the radio right now and it still tears me up there are movies that i love and classical music pieces i love but there is no combination i can think of that comes close to the impact of nevsky performed in real time,1
3639,i preface by stating i am a big fan of and not one of patrick therefore i watched this to see her performance and of course it was excellent i do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re shot angles blocking etc if the director was trying to give it a realistic feel they failed and lost some good performances because of it nearly always felt that the camera was way too static too far from intense facial reactions and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters the dialog was slow and plodding this easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle but the impression i got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used i also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was used up,0
3640,i thought this movie was highly underrated the subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and i was put off at first but once i was watching the movie it didn't seem strange at all i was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and i couldn't wait to find out how it would end once it did end i thought about it for a long time after i was pleased with everything about k pax from the acting and the story and the scientific elements and psychological issues to the ending it's not an especially upbeat or happy film though it does make you chuckle from time to time but i found it to be especially entertaining and thought provoking i own it now and intend to watch it many times,1
3641,this movie was quite a mess there wasn't anything really going for it the only character that had any appeal was bobbie phillips' maya and she wasn't even worth it br br the plot is standard double cross the double crossing double with a few too many double crosses to make any sense sometimes that means it keeps you guessing in this case it keeps you waiting by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot,0
3642,in 1974 the teenager martha maggie grace moves to the high class area of belle haven greenwich connecticut on the mischief night eve of halloween she was murdered in the backyard of her house and her murder remained unsolved twenty two years later the writer mark christopher meloni who is a former la detective that has fallen in disgrace for perjury in o j simpson trial and moved to idaho decides to investigate the case with his partner stephen weeks andrew mitchell with the purpose of writing a book the locals squirm and do not welcome them but with the support of the retired detective steve carroll robert forster that was in charge of the investigation in the 70's they discover the criminal and a net of power and money to cover the murder br br murder in greenwich is a good tv movie with the true story of a murder of a fifteen years old girl that was committed by a wealthy teenager whose mother was a kennedy the powerful and rich family used their influence to cover the murder for more than twenty years however a snoopy detective and convicted in disgrace was able to disclose how the hideous crime was committed the screenplay shows the investigation of mark and the last days of martha in parallel but there is a lack of the emotion in the dramatization my vote is seven br br title brazil not available,1
3643,the simpsons of course started off with christmas special simpson's roasting on an open fire which had basic drawings and not laugh out loud jokes but this episode has probably the first laugh out loud joke in it and from here the show just gets better and better this episode centers around bart who in this episode swaps on a test from martin and gets into a school for the highly gifted this leading to bart his friendship with his dad and losing all of his mates the episode is very humorous and shows what was to become the greatest show ever to come out overall fans of the show will love this episode as it features the character's exactly as they became 20 years later so watch this episode in a pack of season 1 and enjoy early simpson's doing what it was meant to making people laugh i rate this episode 73,1
3644,oddly enough it's fred macmurray who plays the more screwy part in this screwball comedy carole lombard shows a fine performance combining lighter moments with and undercurrent of drama and seriousness br br as usual fred macmurray remains a mystery to me the camera is no fan of his he's not that attractive and he doesn't have the style and panache to pull off this very cary grant like role br br ralph bellamy is excellent as the kind friend coming back to life through his relationship with lombard's character one can only wonder why her character wouldn't want his gentle reassuring love instead of the almost certain doom of macmurray's ineptness but that's hollywood br br the picture almost works but misses the mark primarily due to macmurray's performance it would've been lovely to see grant or even clark gable in his role lombard and bellamy are largely believable and likable macmurray is stiff and makes you want to keep him at arm's length,0
3645,i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences i guessed the film will be interesting in fact isn't at all not so much profound for a such subject eternity never ending life experiences after death and the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all at least not express yet it's so naive charming film but naive film a must to avoid the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it,0
3646,tom stern and jeremy slate are swing bachelor's planning to hijack a casino ala ocean's 11 and pin it on the hell's angels bad move for a film with the words hell's angels and the number 69 and featuring actual hell's angels this movie is surprisingly tame the hell's angels truly deserve a better film to be centered around them not this luckily this is one of the dvds that features commentary by joe bob briggs so the pain of having to sit through it is greatly if you watch it any other way let me recommend something to you don't br br my grade d br br dvd extras joe bob commentary conny van dyke's message to her fans she has more than one photo gallery theatrical trailer and trailers for blood shack hell high samurai cop and the hollywood strangler,0
3647,i watched this on sky tv late one night as i am a vampire fan i must admit i half expected it to be a b movie disaster but i was pleasantly wrong br br subspecies is about a family of vampires when a vampire lord dies his two sons the handsome and noble stefan and his brother the evil hideous start a war with each other over their birth right the the is a holy grail of sorts for vampires and it bleeds the blood of saints which give the vampire who drinks it an ultimate high br br the fight for the takes an unexpected turn when 3 college students turn up in the brothers' territory on a school trip and stefan has to protect them from his brothers lusts br br like i said i went into this film not expecting much at all but it was one of the best low budget movies i have ever seen the sets and locations romania i think been a while since i've seen it are very nice and the music score did the film justice br br most of the acting was adequate but its anders as the evil that steals the movie and all the subsequent sequels performance as the twisted vamp is truly breathtaking and bumps the film simply from okay to pretty d mn good,1
3648,the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood but that's the only blood in the entire film br br the evil below isn't the worst around but for a horror film it is tediously boring the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do i manged to sit through it all just about but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover but it's best left at that,0
3649,this is an amazing movie and is very clever at using the few actors and sets it is also very shocking the physical and psychological torture both explicit and implied is mixed with calm and even humourous stretches so the horror is always unexpected and brutal i'm not soft but this would have to be the most shocking film i have ever seen the message of this film is definitely delivered with a sledgehammer this is the film i will always remember both actors for,1
3650,i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent well thought out review however i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like underemployed and overly ego inflated actors there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a hipster la coffee shop one of the worst indie films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending much less considering a sundance review to be meaningful watch at your own risk,0
3651,this was the best film of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's yes it is a rip off of goodfellas but as the saying goes good poets borrow great poets steal and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best plus added some genius touches of his own i gave this a ten which is very rare for me br br the main reason i am commenting on this though cause i could just rave all night is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue what are you thinking this deserves the full screen experience look at the ratio it was shot in i saw it 5 times at the cinema and haven't bothered to watch it on video br br nuff said,1
3652,william h macy is terrific in this alfred hitchcock esque film macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends the characters that ensue are hilarious james cromwell gives a terrific performance as a blackmailing private detective as always macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance see this movie whenever it is on t v and check your video stores because this is one you don't want to miss,1
3653,a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and horrors liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the pest ' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was i decided to give it a try br br bad mistake br br the story although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the manhunter theme goes would be amusing under the right conditions good actors writer director wardrobe and so on and so on to almost no end clearly these factors are absent br br 'the is supposed to be funny i think i say think because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film not a guffaw not a laugh not a chuckle not even a grin a smile at best and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile maybe 3 or 4 times at best br br so do yourself an immense favor never watch this movie avoid at all costs,0
3654,from the first to the last scene of the movie director visconti excels at his art to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only god knows how long it is perfection as a movie that is but the story has some minor shortcomings br br thomas mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art so of course it is impossible to bring into another media visconti follows the story pretty much and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly that the transition falters and no matter how wonderful the scenery is the tension in the air between the characters the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories the almost unbearably heightened serving of music still the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me br br maybe i'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless nevertheless i will offer one example which i regard as crucial br br warning spoilers br br in mann's story eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy in venice unable to catch one delight he settles for another which poisons him it is very subtle in the book but it is there the forbidden fruit of sorts but more a sign of him surrendering life itself br br in visconti's film he also eats strawberries but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach the chase in venice ends in a much more melodramatic way it works too but lacks some subtlety indeed and also the multi layered symbolism giving food for thought br br but that's all forgiven when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries faces and constellations and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest the last gesture of standing in the water being the equally sublime and mysterious finale,1
3655,this video has heartfelt memories it has a great cast and all the actors did a great job i have been searching to buy this video if anybody knows of where i can purchase please e mail me i really want to add this to my collection,1
3656,this movie has every cliché of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie br br however it is not entirely unwatchable thanks to good performances by rowland and and maybe br br what is amazingly bad though is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes boy oh boy the cgi scenes in the last starfighter filmed in 1984 are better than these filmed 17 years later the feeling of really sends shivers down your spine br br a pity this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste,0
3657,the omission of jazzy jeff the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch raised a few eyebrows but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the dvd after all with scratch doug pray who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in hype 1996 made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip hop dj and the evolution of his latest documentary infamy 2005 explores contemporary american graffiti culture after a couple of viewings four years ago my dvd had been gathering dust ever since but recently i watched it again and besides the subject material i was surprised how well shot and edited this documentary actually is an immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads but lots of music old school footage parties break dancing you name it one of the best things about the film is that it mainly examines where the art of is today in 2001 that is without disregarding the pioneers of course good stuff br br camera obscura 8 10,1
3658,stupidly beautiful this movie epitomizes the 'so bad it's good' genre of films br br the only two talents in it are richard boone and joan van ark and only boone is any good it's kind of sad that the man who rose to fame as should wind up in this ugly pile of celluloid while he turns in a fantastic performance i couldn't help but feel that he so outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that he shouldn't even have been there br br the effects in this film are laughable but fun the idea of a dinosaur being buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly coming to life is b movie gold when the gets killed watch how it falls it's clear that the stunt performer in the front of the costume knows the timing best he falls to the ground well before the back half of the dinosaur follows suit br br speaking of there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaur in this flick it seems to have some kind of stealth technology since reputed to be the best tracker in the world twice fails to notice it until it's within biting range of him i don't know how all the prints are but in the version i own the roar contains godzilla's trademark bellow br br this is loads of fun to watch if you like bad movies i love them and especially bad monster movies so i consider this the gem of my collection if bad movies are your thing definitely get this one,1
3659,this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess dancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by lionel newman's music and the film's style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald adams' script set in ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the film's swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classically trained actors such as michael edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us critics' all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to this estimable film's obvious anti tyranny and pro entertainment qualities,1
3660,i think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera the acting is very amateur this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members with no professionalism whatsoever should the director s and or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few ok many classes on film making and acting,0
3661,this film is the most impressing turkish film that i have ever seen probably okul is the first turkish horror film i must say that i were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons the first reason is that the story is impressive i mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before this shows that turkish film improves itself by time although the first trial to make a horror movie it was really successful i advice all of you not to miss this movie,1
3662,this is a movie that should have been a mini series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub plots character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband with that said there are no less than 1000 sub plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible in the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer after a half hour and completely disinterested i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time wash your socks instead,0
3663,this wonderful film has never failed to move me the colour convincing cast and stunning scenery all make big contributions this production unlike the later remake by carlton is more impressionistic and presented more from the children's own perspective it on certain episodes from e charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary warts and all style that carlton adopts above all the superb musical score of the late johnny douglas underpins the story throughout adding extra emotional depth the net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of the railway children br br one uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout this film is how things have changed since those times and in many ways for the worse yes maybe many of us no longer have to use outside toilets and travel in horse drawn carts but what about the quality of life in general consider the foul mouthed celebrities who now grace our tv screens their language is now apparently considered perfectly acceptable consider too the fragile here today gone tomorrow aspects of so many of today's plus all the single mothers whatever happened to that institution called marriage when people accepted each others' flaws but still remained together loving their children these details add extra when watching this marvellous film br br i hope that as generations pass children will still be able to enjoy this film not to mention certain adults,1
3664,i love a cute heartfelt movie with a happy ending this movie could be considered a drama bout two characters realizing true love but the story's so touching and so sweet that in my mind its a romance granted the acting is not so great thats y i didn't give it a 10 but they do the job and they don't overact thank god plus they're cute but the story's powerful and just plain adorable some of u pansies will choke up its a great watch for a love story but if ur homophobic stay away for everyone else i loved the movie its soo sweet i felt its a brokeback on a smaller scale but with a happy ending so enjoy,1
3665,this is an example of a movie that can have great potential and is executed very poorly i am a fan of kids and thumb sucker and many other so called teen angst films but this one bugged me br br why is every white kid made into a thug who loves rap its getting to be one dimensional the acting was awful but simple since it mainly consisted of just dropping f bomb after f bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this thumb sucker kids bully all br br those i think are better so i recommend one of those is you'd like to see a good teen movie i hope my comment you found useful and hope you hear future comments from me,0
3666,by randolph scott standards of the 1950s this is a disappointing and heavy handed star western two or three of the characters could be dispensed with while two or three other characters could be given more prominence the humour needs to be completely rewritten de toth handles the action well as always but his grasp of the overall narrative is weak,0
3667,when the long running 'happy ever came to an end its characters june were revived for the longer running and more popular sequel although their surnames were changed from fletcher to br br terry has received a new job and as a result he and june move to where they end up in all manner of scrapes unwanted guests dropping by to visit at an inconvenient moment the boss inviting himself to dinner and terry trying to chance his arm at d i y but cocking it up each time a fellow imdb user branded this show as 'not and 'never well fair enough it wasn't clever but that was the whole point as for 'never well some of the episodes were pretty substandard i will admit but overall i found it to be extremely well written highly amusing and very well acted br br it was warm hearted slapstick not dissimilar to the later b b c sitcom up eight different writers contributed to the nine series giving the show plenty of scope terry scott was a comic genius as he well proved in productions such as i' the on' films and of course here june whitfield likewise was a comedy legend in her own right br br i enjoy some modern shows i e 'still game' 'the catherine tate show' and i even enjoyed the comedy' 'naked video' 'the young ones' and 'the comic strip but i am more inclined to enjoy vintage comedy such as this humour that you don't need to think about is excellent for when you are feeling down and want to lift yourself up for the record was wonderful stuff special note should be made of the catchy theme tune which caught the mood of the show tremendously well,1
3668,opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by theodor and a good not great performance by jannings as henry cannot overcome poor writing and static camera work henny chews the scenery as anne br br it's all very beautiful but it's all surface and no depth the melodramatic tale of a woman wronged made it a hit in america where the expressionistic the cabinet of dr caligari flopped in the same year 1920 proving that what is popular is not what endures lubitsch would be remembered for his lively comedies not sterile spectacles like this,0
3669,jude law nicole kidman and renne they are all horrible especially the star jude law br br it's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man risking all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful english this movie sucks it is really bad br br worst dialogue ever but we've only know each other for a moment but they were a thousand moments like diamonds in a bag br br or br br in some cultures you just have to say i marry you 3 times and you're married lovey dovey i marry you i marry you i marry you i marry you br br i'm ashamed i sat through it all br br the whole movie was awful horrible no words i'm sick br br 1 10 the one is for the really loud bullet sounds the sound crew did a good job,0
3670,five fingers of death started the american kung fu movie craze but i remember seeing it for the first time as king boxer in chinatown nyc without the bad dubbing and few americans i also was fortunate enough to see the american premiere of five fingers of death on times square nyc what a contrast this turned out to be same film but different audiences br br in chinatown this film took on a more serious tone to the viewers it was because of hearing the real voices of the actors in chinese that made this movie more believable chinatown theaters were showing violent kung fu films for years 1972's boxer from beat them all in gore so the action choreography story were the main attraction rival school plots were not overused yet so the storyline seemed fresh every great kung fu film had wonderful dastardly villains you wanted to see get their comeuppance and had them too the star lieh lo was a known actor in chinese theaters the mostly chinese audience enjoyed this film immensely the audience buzz while leaving this film gives the final satisfaction to me br br on times square this film was an action comedy probably unintentionally i enjoyed it here too but for different reasons the crowd was ethnic and quite energetic from the start the movie made you laugh as soon as the audience heard those strange british accents come from those chinese actors the movie turned into a violent and gory cartoon most american audiences saw this kind of gore in a horror film not in an action film the action sequences blew the audience away unfortunately the movie studios saw that they enjoyed it so much that bad dubbing and unnecessary violence became a kung fu flick formula br br i had fun seeing this movie with an american audience but enjoyed it much more in chinatown some films can pass the test of time but the dubbed version of can't the original king boxer is still enjoyable a classic,1
3671,i saw the movie yesterday and was shocked by it but even more shocked by some of the comments i have read here one person wrote that it was ambiguous if the victim of the torture was guilty or not therefore one person wrote that since he wasn't an american citizen therefore some people comment that the people in the middle east hate us and want us dead therefore so are we saying then that it is right to torture someone who is guilty of a crime are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an american citizen are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead are we saying that as is written in the geneva convention the declaration of human rights and the constitution of the united states that torture is wrong but some torture is less wrong than others when does it become right to torture that is why this movie is powerful it is ambiguous but not about torture torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it even in the name of justice and national security or freedom and democracy then we are wrong and we are evil we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing and we are calling them wrong in the same breath my favorite line in the film was if you don't want to compromise join amnesty international right on,1
3672,i know that so many reviews on imdb are extreme with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or tearing it to pieces i find neither of these kind of reviews helpful and so i do not give this film the awful review i am about to lightly the film is art house science fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a hollywood blockbuster the trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved i like films which challenge the viewer and i do not need to be spoon fed a plot and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow no the film is just terrible as the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on cameron diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot line avoid,0
3673,i can't believe that anyone would green light this let alone voluntarily star in it i will never be able to get that 90 mins of my life back br br this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen some films are so bad they're good this has gone so far round again that's somehow it's so bad it's terrible i was not exactly expecting much it being a low budget bandwagon jumping rehash of a b movie but it still came in way under my expectation levels even tv movies have higher production values br br there were very poor special effects shocking dialogue terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot who cursed her and why why did the 6 inch snakes turn into 15 foot snakes has anyone ever heard of highly venomous garter snakes or pythons 100 passengers 3 000 snakes so many promises none delivered br br some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes it's not even worth a rental stay in and watch a low budget tv movie you'll enjoy it a lot more br br why was this made oh yes to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap shame on you brothers shame on you,0
3674,critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie but i actually didn't think it was too bad even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap and i normally despise pg 13 horror films so this means one of two things either 1 i'm too easily pleased and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years or 2 'when a stranger calls' isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be now to be fair some of the criticisms of the movie are true there's not much character development and not much happens in the story but man alive folks how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked cut them some slack as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo who knows i guess stuff like this just gives me the willies br br yes i admit i had fun watching this and i don't care how big of a minority that puts me in,1
3675,why did they not follow the book i am really sad and disappointed i was so looking forward to seeing this movie however if you have read the book maybe recently it might be very difficult to remain objective my wife had not read the book and she loved the movie br br reasons for the disappointment are 1 involvement gone with the wind such a shame there is a very small part at the start where the antimatter is created but even that does not stick to the facts why not the fact that father was burned with the first brand which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie 2 story line between the deceased pope and completely gone this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3 story line between langdon and completely non existent br br all in all too flaky storyline and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid br br really sorry for the negative review which was spoilt by expectations,0
3676,downhill racer is essentially a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences although there is a story here robert redford's character a skier trying to make the u s olympic team is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all gene hackman in an early performance adds nicely but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off and it wouldn't make much of a difference,0
3677,i go to blockbuster pick out a random movie got this and yeah br br this was a good sexual porno the quality kind of sucked and it kind of gave me a damn headache to me this movie was good for its sexual things but not as much for the horror and suspense it was magical br br the suspense not as good as i would have expected i wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear but instead i lay down on the couch and didn't see much br br the quality not really good at all i mean if you pay close attention during when the people are on the cold mountains their barely wearing anything it doesn't make much sense too br br so if your looking for a crap not really suspenseful and a pretty much sexual movie you've got this,0
3678,just what is the point of this film it starts off as one film then changes track cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale pale imitation of so many other schlock horror flicks you've ever seen the overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris screenplay by tarantino direction by rodriguez two guys who have previously shown talent but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because they did it but it doesn't quite work that way you're only good while you continue doing good things there are so many questions to ask just what are george clooney and harvey keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going but of course we never do and the clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character that's not clever or witty that's just bad bad work keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout and no wonder did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go ahead tarantino is utterly unpleasant as a murderous sexual deviant and why did he as writer assume we would find the rape gruesome murder and butchering of an inoffensive hostage funny on every level  except the technical  this film stinks avoid,0
3679,the first film is somewhat good to me i enjoyed it for the most part but i thought it was really nothing all that special however when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get ruth gordon back to reprise her role the story kind of follows rosemary's baby around and stuff but in reality it is kind of a mess it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well it has more of a comedy tone to it as well which hinders it greatly if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an r rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it i am sure it would have still been quite bad but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny i saw this one on monstervision and joe bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and i do not have to much to say either i do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day,0
3680,there are places for political commentary in film but masters of horror is not one of them i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper now i've got to watch this in horror movies c'mon all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film not another bush is bad rant if joe dante wants to express his politics let him go on air america and if you must insist on making a message film be a little more sly about it this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish br br by the way joe do you really want the left wing voting block to be associated with brain dead zombies might want to think about that before making another political horror movie god help us,0
3681,this movie was recently shown subtitled not dubbed on australia's special broadcasting service i thought i read here that there is sometimes an assumption that revenge of the rats is a sequel in fact the rats are getting revenge for something that is done within this movie or in human history there is no prequel as far as i know br br now let's get the pied piper of out of the way perhaps this tale crossed my mind when i was watching the film but that's all there was the use of the word coffers at the end of the movie a dazed mayor tries to justify her actions by saying the coffers were empty coffers isn't a word you hear around much these days unless you read folk tales to your children as i do since seeing revenge of the rats i've read two versions of the pied piper of now i see the comparison a metaphorical fat but literally ugly mayor promises more than the city can afford to get rid of the rats this is about as far as i can follow the analogy the children are not led to a door in a mountain with one lame boy left behind to tell of a land of winged horses and fountains where it is always spring and everyone is always happy br br there's a lot that is quite mainstream about this movie the romance and the resolution especially the female characters have potentially powerful roles in society but are really quite impotent where this film is quite rebellious as compared with american cinema is that it is anti authoritarian the helicopter pilot is sacked by the mayor for doing good the mayor and local government are portrayed as corrupt and pandering to big money finally it is left to one doctor in frankfurt to solve an epidemic of a fatal and contagious disease apparently there is no national infectious diseases authority to co things or send in back up br br i'm not a horror aficionado so any horror i do see is usually mingled with humour right from the rat in the blood bank you can see this is going to have the right balance of horror and comedy for most viewers the huge number of rats is impressive and the horror fans seem to be satisfied too,1
3682,after i saw la pianiste several years ago i said to myself that i would never see it again so powerful and disturbing it was time went on but i could not get the movie and its main character erika out of my mind the story of a respected piano teacher in vienna conservatory cool and collected on the surface an expert in classical music with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear self loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing i read the book the piano teacher by elfriede jelinek the controversial nobel prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it i saw the film again second time all pieces of puzzle came to the right places not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as le pianiste three actors gave outstanding performances franz schubert's piano music soaked in the morbid humanity is another bright star of the movie br br i only have one problem with haneke's vision there is a scene in the film where haneke made some changes to erika's character comparing to the novel in the book the furthest she went to reveal herself to walter the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter as soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that she had stopped communicating with him erika of the book would never chase walter to throw herself to him she kept everything inside she did not like to act she was not a chaser she loved to watch the big scene during the hockey game was not necessary it tried to make erika sympathetic and of course huppert was heartbreaking but it took the mystery that surrounded her jelinek did not write that scene it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film,1
3683,i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap i recommended they not see it but when it came on tv we saw the ad i turned to family and said i know this is sad but i'm thinking of watching it my sister turned to me and said yeah me too and you know what it was funny br br by no means is this a good movie it's absolutely a waste of time but it's a good waste of time you may still think it's crap and fair enough but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy i didn't like a couple of bits like when the fish got hit by the car but apart from that i thought it was good i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces elle garry mcdonald etc br br so if you like to waste your time watch this movie otherwise see a drama or something,0
3684,in my never ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime i stumbled upon this film on cable i tried hitchcock three times before this and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received i always felt he was good not great from what i've seen this was the best of his films i've seen robert walker is absolutely chilling his performance takes the film where hitchcock wanted it to go even an average performance here damages the overall product my favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain how exactly does he get his arm down there though bruno is quite a compelling character but i also loved the performance by patricia hitchcock as barbara the rest of the morton family as well as guy were a bit dry and boring but she added some flare to the movie as well as having some of the better lines in the script br br lastly in any suspense movie you're going to live and die by your ending this one holds water unlike a couple other hitchcock films i've seen i truly was unsure of how it would end which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited,1
3685,possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply tragically pathetic i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically requested to it is toilet humour at its very poorest i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still bewildered how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes,0
3686,out of all the parodies of star wars i've seen this is probably the funniest not because of the premise star wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships but because of how poorly acted it is this is purposely overacted and it makes it hilarious and since everyone knows its purposely overacted no one complains the special effects were also purposely as awful as can be and include a toaster on a visible string that shoots toast and an egg beater on a string this short is funny for any fan of star wars which i'm not or anyone that has 15 minutes to kill great short br br my rating out of 13 mins not rated,1
3687,i hired the dvd yesterday and first of all it started bad it's 4 3 aspect ratio film and it just keeps getting worse the acting is so bad and the movie itself is way to predictable i was like watching the movie and said to myself this going to happen next and guess what happened right br br if you want to see a good action boxing movie don't watch this one you'll end disappointed on this low budget movie like i did go and see ali its way better,0
3688,you can't help but marvel at hitchcock's early work saboteur for example is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago there's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later you also get some previews of stuff that hitchcock would do later like using a national landmark as a backdrop this time it's the statue of liberty in north by northwest of course it's mt rushmore you'll also recognize things that pop up later in rear window and vertigo in saboteur but let's not give away the show robert cummings is excellent as is the oh so charming otto kruger look for hitchcock's mini western in this one it happens quickly so don't blink,1
3689,boston blackie movies have some strengths mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances but the plotting is frequently atrocious and the unrelenting comic bits often kill the pacing if the plot happens to be atypically good or are just unfunny and inappropriate br br this one involves blackie chasing an escapee from the asylum steve cochran in a really poor performance who has become fixated on beautiful nina foch who puts in a nice rather subtle acting job inspector of course believes blackie has gone homicidal maniac he at least has some evidence in this one for that and is incompetently trying to jail him as blackie goes after the real killer the plot has possibilities but any time any real tension gets going we a get a not funny comedy routine it doesn't seem like anyone at columbia understood that in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac cute little comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of disbelief one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot deadly for a film like this br br this one is not worth the time for a well plotted episode of this series see alias boston blackie,0
3690,surprising witty funny and totally engaging the film grabs a little known reality that of the student that goes studying in an erasmus program the beginning is great as the story kicks off of course it has a few lulls on the midsection and the story drifts sometimes away from the main character but the viewer won't bother the movie is young fresh and light hearted even though i don't agree with the notion that when you do erasmus and you come back you no longer make part of that universe but that's just me the movie is deep and at the same time very light cool and recommendable,1
3691,i was never in the past interested in this play although love shakespeare and have seen most of his plays now and enthusiastically studied some at school something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to put me off i never bothered to try to see hamlet until fairly recently deciding i should at least try to watch it and i borrowed the olivier version from the library well i struggled with it olivier seemed far too old not only in his looks but in his acting of the part the play had been enormously cut to fit a more conventional movie length and i think must have missed out too much as i found it difficult to concentrate on it soon became bored and annoyed by it i still think olivier's henry v is the best version i've seen of that rousing play tho' admit i haven't rewatched the beeb version yet and can't recall how it was when first shown br br i heard of the branagh full length version of hamlet although i enjoyed his much ado i think the beeb version is far better and i wasn't entirely impressed by his henry v but i was off branagh a bit after seeing his disappointing effort at a musical of love's labour's lost which is a play i like and was so well made by the beeb br br finally acquiring the complete beeb shakespeare on dvd recently i soon rewatched one of my most favourite shakespeare plays richard ii and was simply enthralled by jacobi in the part so was immediately persuaded to watch his hamlet next what a revelation this play now is for me yes it is splendid but i feel it needs an actor you can with to play hamlet and this for me is jacobi amazing intriguing to note that although he is older than i understand the character hamlet was it doesn't show whilst in olivier it did now i note he's also in the branagh version and had much to do with training branagh so i shall have to watch that to see what does with claudius i'm interested to discover jacobi has trained branagh as yes you can certainly see the influence br br and now i'm going to watch it all over again,1
3692,the evil gang in this movie were called the savages hence the title but minor would have been a better name for this sorry mob of weak actors trying to look dangerous whenever they wanted to kill someone they generously rode their bikes very slowly so that their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes their leader had a bad limp but still thought he could take on the hero and win as for karen black she didn't seem to know where she was for most of the film,0
3693,got the chance to see this at a friend's house today and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget not that this ever bothered me anyway since i love low budget sci fi like dr who blake's 7 and dark star hell even outland wasn't a big budget affair so whilst money helps it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good br br the story is straightforward at first with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet they then discover the prisoner has made it too he's a stone cold nut case and that's only the start of their problems br br the effects except for the gunfights are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it computer effects look a bit dodgy at times but serve their purpose well and add to the story lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings films like i robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot like all too many of hollywood's offerings br br whilst none of the actors get oscar material it's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes doesn't outstay its welcome the characters don't get fleshed out much but then they didn't in predator either which it resembles in feel big man mike mitchell is a good stand in for arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn br br some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end but i like it unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained it is not so obscure that you can't get a handle on it at all and i'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further br br a cracking little film from an enterprising team done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour if this is what they can do on a shoestring i'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics don't knock all the creativity out of them first br br recommended,1
3694,after the death of all senior officers commander craig scott of the laundry and morale corps finds himself promoted to command of an intergalactic spaceship owned by corporation its chief mission is to search for planets and of course long term coffee markets br br craig scott and his second in command chief blather find themselves ill prepared for command except insofar as they are fully able to keep the crew's undies clean which is not to diminish the importance of clean undies especially when incompetent commanders cause those same undies to be well soiled on a regular basis br br the episodes are presented as a series of short 2 3 minutes reports by the commander to earth the humor is a mix of wry deadpan and outrageous physical comedy think yes minister meets red dwarf but on a shoe string budget all the usual plot devices of sci fi are here aliens nuclear weapons computer malfunctions but each is improved by the fresh lemony scent of high grade laundry br br log is definitely low budget but the somewhat cheesy effects and props fit the absurd premise of the show remember those hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old battlestar galactica with the brand name still visible okay there's a lot of that in log but it's cute br br log ain't high art but that's not what it's trying to be it's just a little bit of off kilter fun it does a good job of being that,1
3695,when i was very young my mother had a series of four looney tunes merrie melodies shorts on tape and i watched them all several times a coy decoy was one of these shorts and i was truly shocked to read in another comment that it had been banned when i was young i probably did not even understand the black beauty gag to begin with still this is probably why it was banned though until i watched this on a video site i did not even remember the gag upon viewing the video i did remember certain shots in particular the shrinking of hat and eyes becoming as the decoy him in the lake i was not bothered by the gag that was most likely the reason the gag was banned instead i was flooded with childhood memories of watching this short because of how much i liked this short as a child i rate it 7 out of 10,1
3696,i took my 14 year old to see this movie we left after 15 or 20 minutes it was absolutely awful this movie should be rated r at the least i am not that strict with movies but this was just too much it was a waste of money i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was way beyond crude i was sitting there watching and reading a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content i don't understand how the rating system works,0
3697,finally other people who have actually seen this show it is the funniest anime i have ever seen but most people have even heard about it it is just hilarious 'and so kintaro will continue to ride his trusty bike and maybe one day he will save the world or maybe not' tare just some classic bits in it 'and so he will ride onto the next city because he has no choice since his brakes are broken study study study ' and some of the lessons that he writes down in his little notebook 'today i had a very educational experience i tried to look backwards but unfortunately i was already looking that way it hurt todays lesson the human head cannot turn 360 degrees ',1
3698,well i would say that this is a very enjoyable and somewhat touching movie despite its flaws i didn't believe for a minute that matthau knew the first thing about being a dentist also hawn's character seemed to recover from suicidal depression rather quickly at the beginning of the movie not to mention the entire thing seemed rather ridiculous however the film does succeed due to a good pace humor and its stars matthau may not have been a dentist but he was as amusing as he usually is bergman brought a great deal of sensitivity to the film especially during the scene where her and matthau go out for a drink after work and also a good deal of humor i believe it was her performance that made my brother take notice of this movie after overhearing a couple scenes hawn's performance is noteworthy although an oscar may have been over doing it a bit basically don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy yourself,1
3699,other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard for something made by an eighteen year old film student i would say bravo but that is not the case if you want to watch a good movie about stick to the documentaries it is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video the two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film the plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around portland writing he is joined by another and they skate around together creating art then comes the unnecessary gay love scene then comes the dispute between them that is never actually discussed because this film has about as much dialogue as a charlie chaplin picture this movie does show the gravity street artists give to their form well and the music is nice but overall i wouldn't really call it a film,0
3700,let's get right to the heart of the matter this is a terrible movie the story is confusing the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss poor ellen looks like she's in pain barkin's talent is totally wasted in this b grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film,0
3701,the animal eating geek scenes were not as bad as you would think after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic these scenes are average the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me br br otherwise the film was just sort of interesting i always like hearing the silly voice overs they never sound like what you think the actor actress would sound like in real life i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too the youngest princess looked really young almost 14 or something the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes so that was good br br 3 10,0
3702,i was looking forward to dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime but this was easily the worst of the bunch it's really too bad part of this may be due to the poor if odd choice of source materials why joe didn't just write an original i have no idea instead we get this soapbox episode where the message overwhelms the script the characters the staging everything and by the end i was just wondering whether it could get any worse and i won't spoil it but it ended up getting worse what a stinker by such a talented creative team skip this one and buy the john carpenter one instead it manages to balance all of the elements horror humor character vision and it's fun homecoming is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep,0
3703,when i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of kelly a young and op and coming star actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away she is amazing on screen and i'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her br br the movie it self was good in the sense that it let kelly do her stuff and take the for a ride not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before but a good experience i would recommend this movie if only to see kelly this stage actor takes the screen by storm i give this movie a vote of 7 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie br br and on a last note sorry about my bad english if this is gibberish for you p plz ignore me,1
3704,nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford the cool refined english beauty and the warm blooded american male what could possibly be more lovely well this is not that movie right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman that's like casting hugh grant as babe ruth or colin firth as al capone kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with greasy ex junkies in filthy slums or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives br br then there's harrison ford as a regular guy cop certainly he's tough enough for the role but the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow why couldn't he have been say a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue collar roots who inherits late husband's senate seat the two of them are initially quite cool to each other but for sake kristin is cordial to him and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life things her husband sheltered her from her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer more blue collar lover one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband now that's a love story instead of that though you get a blank meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens well there is one ghetto style drive by scene where harrison almost gets killed but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief br br the sky is always gray in this movie and our refined lovely kristin always looks a little chilled when she's supposed to be dreaming of passion she looks more like she's dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time like she'd really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison ford br br all things considered i'd say you can't blame her,0
3705,penelope of wayne's world fame made her mark with the documentary the decline of western civilization about the la punk scene in the late '70s and early '80s most of the documentary features interviews with the punks and footage of concerts which often turn violent overall we get to see how the punk movement was a reaction to the hippies whereas the hippies were into being natural the punks wanted to have themselves as altered as possible what with spiked hair and all but also we see how they're really disaffected and sometimes becoming skinheads br br anyway this is a really great time capsule we're not really sure whether we want to long for that era or feel repulsed by it but this is definitely not a documentary that will leave you neutral truly worth seeing,1
3706,i give it a 2 because of the beautiful mediterranean greece otherwise it would be 1 when nicholas cage came into with his first lines i thought he was just kidding cage as an italian i'm sorry but very wrong actor who's acting is also bad not to mention his accent the story is very loose it might have been good but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay the camera is great photography also but why the hell did you cast nicholas cage and penelope cruz for the role please don't get me wrong i don't have anything against cage he has some really great movies but he obviously isn't for every role it's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set because the story has potential,0
3707,the city story is a brutal hard hitting docudrama about what was once dubbed the town in america the film documents the events that led up to the murder by the city crime syndicate of albert patterson an alabama attorney who made a bid for the state attorney general's office as a way to clean up the vice and corruption plaguing his hometown his son john patterson picked up his father's mantle after his death and won the post making clean up of city a primary item on his agenda br br director phil created a film that has the ability to shock even today the grimness is so relentless that the film is actually difficult to watch we see the crime syndicate beat and kill in order to get what they want the beatings and killings include women and children and one scene in particular revolving around the death of a little black girl is especially disturbing it's not exactly an enjoyable film because there's very little payoff at the end to reward the viewer for sitting through the infuriating events leading up to it but it's a well made film full of an intense and angry energy br br a 15 minute prologue includes a series of interviews with the actual inhabitants of city some of who are then portrayed by actors in the fictional portion of the film it lends the film a quality of urgency that carries over into the narrative so that we feel like we're watching a documentary the entire time a feeling that's helped by choice to film on actual locations br br i'm glad i saw this movie but it's one of those films that fills you with a sense of righteous indignation and then makes you feel helpless because you can't do anything about it br br grade a,1
3708,worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked to the death of her husband and sister determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state her peril increasing at each stop chasing after her are the traditional 'good cop' and 'bad cop' pair of partners one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some br br wow this was a bad movie the lead acted as if she was the cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station this happens twice and everyone else is as one dimensional as can be avoid this one at all costs br br,0
3709,the reviews for rendition generally haven't been favorable so i waited until it moved to the local discount theatre to see it the film tells the story of anwar el an american egyptian scientist who is plucked from his international flight and hauled in for interrogation after a strange coincidence links him to a recent terrorist attack in an unnamed north african country not as bad as i'd feared it's an interesting and thought provoking entry in the ripped from the headlines thriller genre br br the film ultimately asks tough questions concerning u s methods of prying information from political prisoners is crossing the formerly line of openly employing torture on suspected terrorists something our country should be doing does it yield useful information that helps save lives if so at what cost what sort of monsters do we create when innocent people are taken prisoner and tortured by sanctioning the use of torture what sort of monster do we as a country become it's always disappointing when a film with such provocative material is sloppy with some of the details that make good films great for example i'd like to have empathized with wife who spends the entire film trying to track him down but the only identifiable personality trait she's given is an advanced state of pregnancy rendition also seems to imply that arab women who don't go along with their fathers' arranged marriages are only asking for trouble and there's a poorly conceived scrapbook kept by another of the film's main characters that too conveniently spells out in great detail all the information his love interest just happens to be in urgent need of at that particular moment i laughed out loud when the moment should have been filled with dread br br the film features a good central performance by jake gyllenhaal and strong but too brief appearances by hollywood veterans meryl streep and alan arkin as well as impressive turns by omar as anwar el and also by actors and all of whom i would much enjoy seeing in future films that have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism good luck to them the five or so stories rendition follows are woven together nicely until the filmmakers insert a slight but effective twist that finally alludes to the never ending cycle of carnage that violent attacks of terror,1
3710,hey there army sgt i'm sorry dude but being a sgt in the army and being in the army national guard does not make you qualified to comment on a marine movie you are not a marine and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a marine we simply are the best we have the hardest training yes we have big heads about ourselves but hey when you are the best you like to strut your stuff i was in the iraq invasion and in i fought next to soldiers you are not qualified to say anything about my marine corps i hate to be the one that starts the whole which branch is better but you have no right to say you are qualified to judge a marine movie oh yeah we are drill instructors not drill that's the biggest clue you have no idea about what you are talking about yeah we do not curse at recruits anymore tell me how is cussing at someone going to make them a better marine how will me hitting someone make a marine a better marine yes it is a kinder boot camp from what i went through but we are dealing with different times and people we are training people who are over all smarter than our generations recruits we want smarter recruits not meaner and anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer we don't have to reinforce that in marines come to wanting to be killers we don't need to teach them that by them by swearing at them and beating them at least that is how i feel and yes i am qualified to say that i have been on the battlefield numerous times and i have trained marines and recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield but then again what do i know i was just there done that got the t shirt sgt of the army get a clue,1
3711,this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen no story no point it wasn't even funny at all not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much felix bean the main character sucked susanna sucked this movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s what else i'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again hmm the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers who kidnapped them and stole their identities wow what a waste of time the only minute thing that was funny was freaky ricky he was funny especially when he and emily ended up together that was funny all and all it sucked waste of time and sleep wow never thought a movie like this could be made so dumb for watching for watching it to the end,0
3712,hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting for the people who say they don't make shoot em ups like they use to well this one is really hard core david bradley is really good and his character takes a pounding in the movie he gets hit by the stick over a dozen times gets stabbed in the back and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up and fights again gets beat up recovers and is ready for more action his character is incredibly tuff charles napier was very good as well and he arguably steals the show wells was good professor toru tanaka had a short and an uncredited role in hard justice as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the huge stand off like scene in the beginning has cars getting blown up and flipping up in mid air there is so much that happens in the 95 minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and fighting that this film has to offer hard justice is a movie that isn't easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper an d plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay half com amazon com's z shops and market place sellers i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot and fighting movies and has been disappointed by other movies that have the look like a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get hard justice,1
3713,this is first of all a good exciting story with well developed characters but all the other details are well crafted on top of that leading to a wonderful film don't let the disney label lead you to think this is dumbed down or only for kids it has a lot to offer to all ages whether you like golf or not one of the more impressive things is that the film manages to make a golf game look really exciting and speaking as one of many who can't abide golf on tv this is no small feat br br the first half of the film does a good job of laying out the basic characters with their motivations and backgrounds enough that you end up liking all the important competitors once the pivotal match begins halfway through sure you root for character all along but his primary opponents are likable and interesting in their own right the background layer is important once the golf match becomes a match using minds as well as golf clubs since you get a good understanding for what each person's strengths and weaknesses are as the play progresses br br the computer effects are flashy but they do help the story more often than not the directing has all sorts of clever golf shots and the period costumes and sets are really top notch br br there are a few small quibbles many of the minor characters seem a little too stereotypically cast from the class warfare mold but this is forgivable with the major characters so well drawn br br shia playing francis is as usual callow and sympathetic but the real standout is steven playing harry he rarely moves his face but his intense often sad eyes and minor changes of expression say so much br br caddy eddie lowery played by josh flitter steals the scenes he is in after you see the film google to find the actual photograph of and lowery at the tournament to get an even better appreciation of how incredible this match truly was,1
3714,fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels there were loose ends with the writing for example it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of jim carrey's character dick harper but the writers never follow up that particular conflict basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny but carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor but honestly jim carrey wasn't very funny in this movie and tea leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either this is just another example of hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story,0
3715,i saw this film via one of the actors' agents and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of australia in terms of the overall tone which is rightly dark and moody br br i thought the little boy in the film was excellent mostly kid actors are hammed up and embarrassing but not in this case he was really very good in terms of the surrealism thingy mentioned by well i just think this film is plain ' it's a real weirdo film with weirdo locations storyline weird stuff going on the whole time but 'good' weird as opposed to 'bad' br br its hard to think of other movies like it but its not at all like cars ate paris maybe more like a repulsion but actually i think more like a hammer movie from the 60's its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it br br my question is also about the title why modern love anyone also what did you mean by god forsaken when you were talking about australia hmmm just curious,1
3716,this work is pretty atmospheric with a couple of surprises a few really creepy elements i found this work more rewarding than i first expected given the rotten reviews this receives here at imdb the dialog comes across as natural and honest given the circumstances although the overall run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling down when they should be running and investigating strange noises when they should be locking their doors typical horror movie fare br br the local characters are some of the worst clichés depicting appalachian natives as in bred challenged freaks the characters of the children and the principals are great the development given is adequate and scout taylor compton seems to be developing her talents quite well br br now i'm not going to say that this is entirely original or the best thing since sliced bread which isn't all that great by the way but this is interesting and i do not long for my 107 minutes back i would not say this is an awesome movie by any means but there are some really good horror elements herein but there are also some really slow spots where plot character development seem superfluous to the director's or the film editor's whim br br all in all this is good for a rainy night but not so good for a friday saturday night's viewing br br it rates a 7 6 10 from br br the fiend,1
3717,any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat and on that level the film is amusing but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy her famous new england enunciation slips through making lines like i'd better rustle up some pretty ludicrous she's so pretty and so it almost overcomes this major flaw the story is an old fashioned melodrama and there fore a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the 1940's it has its moments but you might need to be a die hard movie buff to appreciate it,0
3718,i'm a huge fan of legendary director elia kazan his movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses be it obsessive love in 'splendor in the grass poverty in a tree grows in brooklyn or racism in gentlemen's agreement while looking for other movies made by kazan i stumbled across a movie that was based on a novel by arthur miller the movie called focus stars william h macy who happens to be one of my favorite actors and laura dern it deals with anti semitism in a very realistic way br br macy's character seems to go along with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his job until it affects him personally that's the key here the reason he acted wasn't because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand he acted because he was now considered an outsider and he began to experience the same looks the same remarks and the same brutally that mr david experienced br br the movie is very well written and well acted meat loaf does a awesome job of playing a dirt bag both macy and dern's performances are outstanding it's easier in life to go along with instead of going against sometimes in order for people to take a stand things have to impact their lives or the lives of their loved ones only then will some find their moral compass,1
3719,this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time and i've recently seen starship troopers 2 i could find nothing to redeem this film the acting which is probably the best aspect of the film is fair at best michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be vinnie jones accent is bizarre one positive thing is that leonor looks fantastic her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why shes there br br the dialogue is truly appalling it is quite simply rubbish i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round br br this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten avoid at all costs,0
3720,when i borrowed this movie i wasn't expecting a high quality performance but this was just sad br br most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldn't easily get into this movie if you tried there's nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like oh no my dad is invisible or i wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic over the radio with there are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller parts br br the story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there aren't too many real plot changes lots of holes too for example the dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again so the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store couldn't he just ask his dad for the cash br br this shows up in the comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the invisible dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times funny at first but it gets old br br 2 5 because it is watchable and it's one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines,0
3721,oh good grief br br i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought i must watch this movie ripping off snakes on a plane it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too sounds fantastically bad well i was half right br br this movie is eye meltingly bad and sadly not even unintentionally hilarious it's just bad even worse it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language mexican or spanish apologies for my ignorance and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on then we have to endure even more terrible acting and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous br br low budget does not always mean bad but in this case it does what we have here is a movie given no thought a terrible script a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous avoid if you can br br see this if you like the wicker man remake terrible cgi,0
3722,i recommend that movie viewers if in the new york city area go to the intrepid museum and get some idea of how closed in and cramped the living was for the crews of world war ii vintage submarines how much more so that must have been for the seamen during world war i it must have truly been hell below br br walter huston and robert montgomery head the cast of hell below huston as the by the book captain and montgomery as his free wheeling number two they're both quite believable as naval officers and the rest of the cast like robert young eugene palette jimmy durante madge evans sterling holloway etc fill their roles quite nicely br br the silent service got more popular during world war ii and after it's amazing but i could name a whole slew of submarine pictures like torpedo run operation pacific of the navy run silent run deep and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in all of them i guess there truly is a limit on situations as well br br jimmy durante's performance is interesting he's pretty funny and his scene with the boxing kangaroo while on shore leave is very funny indeed but i'd have to say a character like him in those cramped quarters is probably very necessary for morale if you don't have someone like that to break the tension on board a submarine you ought to get one transferred to your ship immediately br br the highlight for me however is sterling death scene very similar to sean in island in the sky it will haunt you long after you've seen this film,1
3723,this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row public domain films from the first half of the 20th century or are a fan of amateur film making the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the actors with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip all of the performers are simply dreadful attempt to interact with the stock footage the new footage is covered with digitally added film scratches as is some of the already substandard old footage as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading this film while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear is a technical and creative wreck in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to island' whatever that is the flashback then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras and of totally disparate film quality unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' 1925 the most dangerous game 1932 white zombie 1932 bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla 1952 and some other poverty row productions this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera br br the filmmakers seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors carradine zucco etc etc this tactic was done cleverly as well as subtly in 'final here it's just obnoxious bizarre and painfully unfunny jokes about spiderman dracula and superman abound even the old as dirt and lawyer reference is used here this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s br br the film stock and audio don't match scene to scene and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi the finale effect is that he seems to be getting older younger older thinner heavier younger and older again minute by minute oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy br br truth be told though it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed maybe thats what they wanted to happen,0
3724,i heard about this series in 2001 which a friend of mine was recording off the television each week i never bothered to watch though i became acquainted with the series through the magazine which i looked at every now and then in bookstores i recently purchased series one on dvd and have become addicted to this fascinating and original series the characters at first seem unlikeable but it is amazing how fast they grow and develop into a united force as they begin to care for one another it becomes easy to care what happens to them bearing in mind that this is only a tv series and they are fictional br br however it isn't the pc world of star trek and so whilst every character shows a good trait they each have their own flaws and demons that they must deal with story lines mixed in with an overall multiple story arc make this one of the most complex and rewarding television experiences i have ever had the pleasure of viewing i absolutely enjoy watching each of the characters interact with one another br br this strange new world we are introduced to is brilliantly portrayed through the eyes of astronaut john crichton and as he learns and adapts to being on the other side of the galaxy strange alien creatures different cultures being hunted by a character that wants him dead and being treated as inferior by his comrades we can easily relate to what he must be feeling as he becomes used to his surroundings so do the viewers and his compassionate strong willed and brave character is a joy to watch br br i have watched only seven episodes of farscape season one and look forward to continuing through seasons two four and the mini series maybe one day we can all enjoy a season five highly recommended viewing and well worth setting time aside to watch buy and enjoy 10 10,1
3725,this film is a cash in a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic yul brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values lee van cleef takes over the lead role of chris i can't think of any actor who looks less like brynner than van cleef hey he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache just for the sake of continuity some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride is brought to the fore and wielded they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie abysmal,0
3726,this is the best direct to dvd effort from van damme that i have seen yet van damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the united states the action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with van damme's best costar scott adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre for further evidence check out undisputed 2 adkins is so good in fact that before i watched the shepherd i thought that van damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen van damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as adkins is he can still kick with the best of them all of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well the only negative thing i can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped i think van damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit the reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end there are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a van damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development overall though this is a solid action movie that i recommend so run for the damme border,1
3727,some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens you are alone is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain death is explored figuratively and literally it is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive too awake to reality it is the life not which you imagined behind the eyes of passer this film explores the aching pain in us all the frown beneath the cheery facade the ache below the ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all the writer is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand he as director focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation this is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together i have encountered as of yet even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounter br br the soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough it is each characters real voice sung through the beauty pain talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market the perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it br br i always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with mr both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it,1
3728,is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of japanese film the other two being ozu and this is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired geishas whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mystique well for those who are interested watch this film one is successful as a money lender but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful doesn't have any children but the other do finds out that her old love is coming to visit her and is excited is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness and one's life worth very good film indeed,1
3729,if you want to see a film starring stan laurel from the laurel hardy comedies this is not the film for you stan would not begin to find the character and rhythms of those films for another two years if however you want a good travesty of the rudolph valentino blood and sand which had been made the previous year this is the movie for you all the stops are pulled out both in physical comedy and on the title cards and if the movie is not held together by character the plot of movie is used well sort of,1
3730,this horror tale takes place in the desert of africa a canadian systems analyst zach scott is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company although he hates field work he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping blowing sand four diamond prospectors are found well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered during a long cold desert night a shape shifting monster makes its appearance zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one there is no character development let alone dialogue to speak of the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away the creature is as old as the desert sands also in the cast are rachel shelley warrick grier and patrick,0
3731,this movie clearly has an agenda which could be summed up like this never never cross the border either physical or metaphorical let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else let's pretend all are evil satanic or drug dealers all that is outside one's country's border and specially us borders is dangerous malevolent and people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else the based on true events is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or in this case just to help pushing the film's ideology down some naïve throats out there the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories mexicans into disgusting people mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops republicans into the right wing morons democrats into almost hippie and so forth is there anything good about the film i hardly think so but may be you think differently,0
3732,can this really be a troma movie some scenes almost have an a movie look the acting is generally competent the two leads and the nurse surrogate were especially good and i liked some of the confrontations between the young capulets and ques the scenes were smoothly edited the plot is coherent it's funny it has a hip original sound track br br it does have the usual troma gross outs and low humor but i don't think shakespeare would have minded so much in fact i think he might have gotten a few good laughs out of this br br it's a good dvd there is an alternate sound track with a very informative commentary by the director several deleted scenes and the usual collection of troma self deprecating silliness br br i'm not going to tell you this was citizen kane but it is some pretty inspired low budget filmmaking,1
3733,yet again director j lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick in fact this is probably bronson's most brutal film quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish ten to midnight and chato's land however brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest br br the story is about a retired hitman bronson who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hell holes throughout the film especially at the beginning we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is br br these themes are actually quite serious torture does go on in latin american dictatorships and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint but the evil that men do for all its worthy posturing isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scum bags it's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues the torture sequences make you the viewer feel like a dirty sick in the head voyeur rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing snuff movies the script is full of horrid dialogue including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them sorry but that's just wrong,0
3734,at first sight the bothersome man seems like several other movies books rolled into one kafka's the trial melville's bartleby the fall and rise of reginald and groundhog day instantly spring to mind a man andreas arrives in a nameless city where he is immediately given a job in an office and finds a beautiful new girlfriend however there's a catch his colleagues are all friendly bland and utterly characterless and everyone he knows including his girlfriend seems to have only one topic of conversation interior design welcome to the hell of modern consumerism in which people throw themselves from buildings and no one raises an eyebrow or spend their days reading furniture catalogues and eating food that tastes of nothing br br andreas quickly realises his predicament and spends the rest of the film trying to escape in various ways suicide turns out not to be an option and when he finds a new girlfriend she is just as bereft of feelings as the old one there is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to move in with him and all she can say is 'i don't mind' br br in fact much of what the bothersome man has to say has been said before and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you indeed are experiencing a certain sense of deja vu yet its point is one that is probably worth repeating over and over again an unexamined life is one that is not worth living added to which it provides a decidedly modern take on the perennial theme of how capitalism is destroying our souls more than one character reminded me of people i've known especially his furniture obsessed girlfriend and if by the end of the film the film makers have run out of ideas maybe that's the point there will no end unless you can find other people who share your sense of alienation,1
3735,okay it's too long and it's too satisfied with itself still the great dictator is a fascinating movie chaplin does a terrific job satirizing hitler and trying to portray the oppression of the jews in nazi germany this was before the concentration camps were common knowledge not a chaplin masterpiece but still worth seeing br br,1
3736,i having both read and watched gone with the wind found it very difficult to not compare this movie with the original although i thought scarlett the novel was superb the movie didn't add up it was a completely different story of course there will never be another scarlett and rhett besides leigh and gable but the new actors did a fine job considering i loved the way the book and movie wrapped up the story of with the wind because after reading it i felt a surge of disappointment because it just stopped and left the readers to wonder what happened scarlett finishes the story very well and alexandra ripley did great on the book i just wish the movie followed the story more although it is great in itself,1
3737,one of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early and fortunately this is one of the better ones yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film because i thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat slob br br first of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous but when the teens arrive it doesn't seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer and if we do it's usually some boring terrible film br br this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie br br all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect,1
3738,i watched this movie with my boyfriend an avid hip hop fan and he was really really looking forward to catch the soul vibe the movie claimed to have boy we were dead wrong when i finished watching the movie i felt two things remorse and relief remorse because i regretted wasting my time to watch this awful piece of dung and relief because i watched it free on cable br br this movie really really gives a bad name to black people by putting so much awful stereotypes that i believe all smart black people everywhere has been trying to spell off i'm asian and i feel very very sorry and sick for those who made this movie what more to say bad writing even worse acting and horrible storyline br br even if you're bored to death and has no other choice don't watch this movie seriously the movie really has nothing to offer except if you want to see things like minor illegal drinking animal slain women degradation and overall a really really bad obnoxious sickening awful movie yuck,0
3739,great movie the sound track is awesome very relaxing sound elton was ahead of his own time even back in 1971 lewis gilbert did a magnificent job producing and directing this film the movie was romantic and a breath of fresh air the sound tracks written by sir elton complimented the movie to a t rex morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song honey roll and poem i meant to do my work today by richard le was incredible kudos to everyone involved with this fantastic film it was no surprise that a lot of the people involved with this movie went on to become the best in their field,1
3740,in chicago four electricians leaded by dean richard grieco come to an old building to disconnect power they accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension where chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants the group meets survivors leaded by crane david and elena kate greenhouse and finds the inventor of the portal dr richard colin fox who has been living in this dimension for thirty years they join forces trying to rebuilt a portal to bring them back home webs is a watchable of sliders only worse most of the dialogs seem to be written by a person who has not concluded the elementary school so imbecile they are further the story is illogical and seems that chicago is the only city in the world the scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is very funny the face of richard grieco looks like a white version of michael jackson and is horrible if the viewer shuts down his or her brain he or she may like this forgettable tv movie my vote is four br br title brazil na do terror in the web of horror,0
3741,wow just caught this movie from blockbuster and i love finding gems like this while it was definitely shot on a budget and misses a little bit in clumsy editing i e accident hospital scenes second to last end scenes for a first directorial effort i give this 10 stars i absolutely loved the thought provoking concepts brought forth and if you're a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box i highly highly recommend this movie i think the director and writer jay floyd should be given some attention and more opportunities in the film industry based on his credits he may be another quentin tarantino,1
3742,i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful aside from the homemade quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point i'm only commenting b c of another comment i saw here that said it was great wow maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available br br the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing br br i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference it may be good but for me the average joe i don't get it,0
3743,the female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking they can also talk like there's no tomorrow otherwise this show would go into the toilet quickly how much money do they make on all the people who text in with that hope to be called back to win 100 oo or whatever boy now that's a scam can i buy stocks in this money maker let's face it with the technology of now thousands of people could be calling every minute and with ten thousand channels and nothing worth a crap on thousands of people watch this show oh i know this answer is probably a super common line among the listeners with these super hotties constantly saying the needs callers i think it's a bunch of b s frequently someone who does get through sounds amazed that they're actually talking to the host many of them sound depressed and worn out by probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get on and score some pocket change wow the producers must be just raking it in no wonder there are so few commercials commercials are only on to give time for more primarily losers to text in and wait and hope and dream and fantasize about what winning enough money for a tank of gas and a dinner at mc something i only watch it now then on my brothers tv because he likes to watch it when he's on the computer i'll sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at mel one of the looking women on tv and laugh at the scam that's in front of me then i have to leave even if i don't people who have an active life can only take this show in extreme moderation mel get yourself into the movies or tv sitcoms or something many of us are infatuated with you even with the super cu ties i'm amazed this show is still on,0
3744,this is an engrossing woman's drama that men can enjoy the plot follows a young woman hope lange who goes to work for a publisher after college we can forgive her jump in position from secretary to editor hey it's hollywood and a few other flaws here is one of the few films in which once big time producer robert evans here beautifully depicting a rat with women appears it also features a mature joan crawford and terrific supporting cast check it out,1
3745,i usually really enjoy steven seagal movies they are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of aikido i usually like the way steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences br br however this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie let alone direct someone like steven seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence br br i never saw the end of this movie i walked out before the end simply because i couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie i am sure that many people also share my feelings,0
3746,nothing special to see here the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era this film has an original story but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters so in my opinion it's not worth seeing i'm not saying that the movie was bad it was just a typical anime story and i thought i watched this movie like a thousand times so if you are looking for something original see another thing,0
3747,i went into this movie with semi high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood and this nearly wrecked that love for me jason lee david seville in the film is horrifying i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there but i really found his performance atrocious along with all the other non animated characters the chipmunks were adorable yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film if you feel you must see this film rent it at the most it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting,0
3748,the book while not particularly great was decent but this movie completely changes it a lot of the elements of the story are consistent between the book and the movie but dr ross' character goes from a creatively written character who lives for money and ends up causing the volcanic eruption with her greed to a heart on her sleeve damsel in distress who won't do anything if she even catches the slightest hint that it might be less than noble when movies change the book that much but keep the same name it should be a crime,0
3749,if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes it's over as far as i'm concerned this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense a good movie has to start and end strong it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise but ultimately muddled and irrelevant there are so many other movies from asia to watch many of which i am sure most of you have not seen that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film,0
3750,a great gangster flick with brilliant performances by well known actors with great action scenes well not this one br br it's rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well known actors that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in br br first of all the plot is as you'd expect it from your average gangster biography nothing new nothing fancy in it the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is when i thought the two hours should be almost over i was quite surprised that only 45 minutes had passed br br the action scenes look a lot like those from 80ies tv series the a team for example it's just that in the 80ies esp with the a team those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in el padrino it's especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they've been shot through br br the acting fits quite nicely to the action either you get the same reaction to everything that happens dolph lundgren style or it's so overacted that you may think it's a parody but unfortunately it's not br br my advise is to stay away from this movie any other gangster movie is better than this one,0
3751,as you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it at his church br br anyway movie had a good b movie sci fi beginning everything was there to make a good entertaining easy to watch movie then everything felt in this religious jesus will save everyone brainwashing mode br br story start with 2 main characters 2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con descendant attitude br br in a few words this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes br br waste of time waste of money avoid it,0
3752,after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version br br i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach br br i was disappointed i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played br br maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach's music that can explain the film br br i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it but i did not br br see it at your own risk,0
3753,i saw this with high expectations come on it is akshay kumar govinda and paresh rawal who are all amazing at their comedy i was really hoping for a laugh riot sadly that is not what i got at all br br unfortunately nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud there were times when i chuckled at one or two things but nothing really made me laugh in short it was badly attempted comedy and in a way a bit of a hera pheri wannabe br br out of the three main guys i think paresh role was the most powerful it wasn't the biggest role but it certainly stood out more than govinda or akshay their performances were okay i guess nothing special just mediocre though govinda stole the limelight from akshay in more than a few scenes lara dutta and tanushree dutta also make appearances in this film and both of them were pretty bad lara's role did not move me or make me laugh and tanushree character just got on my nerves the music seems to be the only good thing about bhagam bhag my favourite song is tere bin followed by which i really liked signal and the title song bhagam bhag are also worth a listen br br you either will like it or you won't and judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction i don't think you will,0
3754,gary cooper and a marshal change identities since they both agree cooper would be more efficient facing the outlaws what is remarkable in this film are the costumes both the and steve who is the bad guy cochran wears his guns backwards probably to be able to the film starts quite excitingly with a showdown with wild bill hickok ruth roman looking very pretty is the fiancee there is plenty of action never a dull moment but you have to concentrate because the story is a bit complicated good entertainment,1
3755,this movie is on cable sporadically and i never really watched it thinking it would be similar to the bruce willis film america with the usual trite story about american freedom etc but it was not it was so much more br br of course martin sheen is excellent i have never seen him in a movie i haven't loved even if the script is bad because he is so talented kathy bates is the overbearing mom and does a great job the real surprise is emilio estevez who has not always been in the greatest films but also directed this movie please don't stereotype him from the breakfast club movie he is so much better in this and i wish he would do more non commercial atypical hollywood movies br br the film is realistic as we see emilio home from vietnam during thanksgiving kimberly williams is passable as the sister who feels she is disgraced and embarrassed by the returning soldier her brother he is quite alienated from the family and especially at this time in us history this story is very relevant br br i learned a great deal about post traumatic stress and you will genuinely empathize with this character this is not a violent journalistic portrayal like platoon for example it is more of a character study which leaves us even more intrigued and concerned about the effects of war especially when one considers the young age of the soldiers who are victims with today's violence it is rare that a movie causes one to genuinely feel sad and shed a tear this does it and deserves recognition,1
3756,i happened to catch about the last 45 minutes of the movie late night about 8 years ago what a wild and funny 45 minutes i was absolutely knocked out by chase shoot out at the end that takes place at night inside an old hotel that's being torn down with a wrecking ball incredible i vaguely remember stacy keach stealing a cop car faking being a cop and strong arming some winos wino to keach hey why ya us keach it's my job you're correct they don't make them like that anymore great movie the hopefully it will see the light of day as a dvd along with other lost treasures hickey and being one such,1
3757,while all of the fleischer famous studios superman cartoons are excellent billion dollar limited the third in the series is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation plot and pacing why it wasn't even nominated for an oscar as best animated short for 1942 incredibly enough only the first one was in inexplicable br br here lois lane is assigned to cover the transfer of one billion dollars in gold to the u s mint masked gangsters in their super powered for 1942 car take off after the train determined to get that gold without giving too much away what ensues is a thrill ride for both the characters and the audience with truth justice and superman triumphant at the end br br as they did in all the fleischer famous superman cartoons clayton bud collyer and joan alexander who played clark kent superman and lois lane on radio have the voice work honors here and fleischer perennial jack mercer gets a little to do as one of the bad guys as well,1
3758,i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill br br the acting of the female lead is actually quite good but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it this is the very definition of dullness br br so far this film is rated as 8 out of 10 on 7 votes that must mean the director director's girlfriend producer actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a 10 br br for the rest of you who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story avoid this br br this man on the street shall give it a 2 out of 10 br br fda note while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep no medicinal value is implied or offered,0
3759,the first half hour of homegrown was rather boring and not absorbing but as the film progressed so did my interest in the characters and the plot several scenes are really scary and you fear for the main characters who you actually grow attached to the story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern california they witness the murder of the owner malcolm john lithgow and they take over the weed for their own the three rather simple minded farm hands soon get swept up into a scary world of mafia and local interest while all of the time trying to convince everyone that malcolm is still alive while the movie had several faults and a slow beginning it turned out to be worthwhile 7 10 stars,1
3760,intelligent nail biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in america when life imitated the film a nuclear power plant employee in southern california is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant ostensibly a stuck valve problem a tv news crew's film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions and worse that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars a cover up that everyone's lives the movie occasionally gets too technical especially in the second half and could use more human interplay however the performances by jack lemmon jane fonda as a puff piece news woman in the right place at the right time and michael douglas as a freelance cameraman are superb the throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical and the news biz with its corporate structure and vapid yes men is vividly captured 1 2 from,1
3761,the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes when sharif or please god palance try their hand at fiery oratory they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling in the ocean and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass what does that leave us with one comical dentistry scene a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro's manic and unremitting cigar fellatio never trust a medved but even a busted clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie,0
3762,i smiled through the whole film the music is great the story telling is great it's a wonderful film this picture is made with respect and a true love of the sixties,1
3763,perhaps this movie was meant to be nothing but funny maybe it was meant to get teenage boys excited at all the nudity in it but what i got out of it was actually something that many people believe in and that is nice guys finish last br br there is a line in angel heart from lisa bonet's character that says it takes a bad ass to make a girls heart beat faster true most likely women always say that they want the flowers and the candy and politeness and whatever but at least at an early age they end up going for the good looking slimy disrespectful untamed guy the one they know they can't conform to their beliefs and that is part of the attraction after all what is exciting about a guy that is already the way you want him to be i believe this may have happened to boaz davidson and what he has to say in this film that is disguised with sex and nudity and parties and everything else that teens can relate to is that you will get your heart broken it happens to everyone and it will happen to you and that is a strong final statement in the film but having said all that the movie is fun it is funny and it shows the antics of highschoolers quite well br br this is a rare film that is enough to please the teenage crowd it caters to but also intelligent and poignant enough to show what it s like to get your heart broken no highschool film has ever done this better like i said i think the writers must have experienced a situation like this first hand maybe we all have br br this is an old film but if you ever come across it gathering dust on a shelf in your local video store one night pick it up you may be surprised it is a hell of a lot better than never been kissed,1
3764,from the makers of underworld we have by far the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld yet lacking vampires not a big deal cool effects a big deal and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy the biggest deal of them all a twenty something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves there she belongs to a small society or pack of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly wed the pack leader gabriel whose son some toad with a british accent takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention so of course such activity is considered forbidden vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood thirsty predators when they end up discovering the secret relationship things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted giving the pack a chance to transform into their wolfy selves all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf very cheezy effects the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy romantic montages and very little action watching this in the theater i could not wait for it to end a devastatingly boring disappointment avoid,0
3765,i have to confess that i know some of those involved i was in the forerunner to the planet evil however this was more than 10 years ago and i had since lost contact with them i happened to be watching bbc scotland news and a piece regarding scottish cinema this mentioned and showed clips from the planet and comments from it's director mark this prompted me to order a copy of the film on dvd br br now to the film the level of acting writing directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around ok it's not star wars but i've seen many a hollywood product that is far inferior it is very strange watching a film spoken in my local north east scotland accent but that soon passed br br mild spoilers br br the planet draws on several sci fi classics star wars alien pitch black forbidden planet and predator a handful of the merchant crew of a deep space transport ship survive their craft being attacked and destroyed by unknown ships they escape onto a deserted desert planet one by one they are killed by invisible attackers the ships only passenger a mysterious prisoner also makes it to the planet a battle ensues as the crew fight to survive br br the planet is a brilliant piece of sci fi film making that certainly hides it's limited budget well done to mark mike and all those involved i look forward to your next work,1
3766,stay far away from this film the fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys this is a truely horrid movie so let's get down to the problems writing and direction it wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive that watched 'scream' and 'i know what you did last a few too many times giant gaping plot holes abound while i can't congratulate them for this movie its nice knowing they're finally potty trained actors or lack thereof only the finest for this film the finest extras ever to grace a screen now starring in their speaking role debut as a disclaimer i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything i recognize a good movie when i see it but i can still giggle and smirk during bubble boy yes folks its true so when i say to avoid something you know i'm not kidding,0
3767,an annoying and talentless american documentary maker learns of a legendary br br south african monster the half caste tradition says that it is a half human half leopard creature with the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of european tradition rather than focus on the creature the film follows the meanderings of the film crew there is little action or suspense until late in the film this problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters generating a ceaseless amount of even more irritating talk the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew br br perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of the blair witch project 1999 or the last broadcast 1998 regardless the film fails on most levels avoid at all costs,0
3768,conquerer of shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want i as a fan did not want a 1920's evil nazi movie what i would have liked to see is a real final showdown between ed and dante as we don't really know what became of her i also would have liked to get ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there to finally get a chance to be normal you know raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic that sort of thing no instead i got a convoluted plot involving nazi mystics fritz lang and about ten minutes of al a joke of a cameo by roy mustang and only one armstrong joke one short joke and no hitting ed with a wrench above all it just didn't feel like alchemist to me,0
3769,i agree with most of mr rivera's comments and i just want to ad a couple of caveats this film the mascot is criminally neglected in its current form for that matter so is vampyr the mascot isn't a bonus feature it's tacked on as a chapter in vampyr even though it's made very clear that this is a separate movie it should have been treated as such by the manufacturers and while i m at it vampyr needs some of that same respect and cleaning up as well i got the feeling the decision to put the mascot on there went something like this br br dude a we just transferred vampyr to dvd but it comes up about 20 minutes short we need to put something on there that won't cost much money can you believe film critics want to be paid to talk about films dude b not to worry i have this little animation thingy that's been sitting in my drawer just go ahead and throw it on as an additional chapter dude a you're awesome dude b the animation's of the mascot is great and there's no need for me to repeat what mr rivera's done so well however this thing needs some major cleaning and restoring especially the audio the plot comes through in the dialogue and in my copy there were so many hisses pops and places where the sound just dropped right off i would have had no idea what the dog was going after without having read the box no amount of volume was going to make the words more understandable it just brought up the and made the hisses and pops louder br br bottom line is starewicz's films need to be put into a respectful collection cleaned up up liner notes and the whole nine yards in other words they need to be 9 out of 10 for the movie not the product which would get only a 5,1
3770,b b thornton proves to be a great actor in this little seen movie thornton really gets into his characters literally i caught this on cable one night and enjoyed it too bad it was released nationwide in theaters the same year as fear and loathing and half baked,1
3771,i'm not going to go into too much depth but showtime was a pretty funny movie there wasn't any slapping your knee funny scenes that i can remember but it had it's moments the cast is pretty good robert de niro is good as usual and eddie murphy pulls off a pretty funny performance rene russo was just fine in the film no complaints there there were two characters in the story that i liked that they didn't explain much at all the first one was trey sellars' eddie murphy's buddy at the gym played by ken campbell i supposed he was just a friend of but i wanted to know more about him the other character that i liked was mitch preston's robert de niro's fellow cop partner played by nestor serrano i guess he was just another cop working with mitch preston but i wanted to know if he was his partner or what not i think maybe i'm putting too much thought into a movie i mean after all it's a comedy who cares about the characters i guess i do though i was really pleased to see this was directed by tom dey who also directed shanghai noon ever since i saw that movie i was looking forward to his next work i think he did a pretty good job with this film and i again look forward to his next work br br all in all it was a good movie but i wouldn't recommend paying full price for a ticket unless you're a die hard robert de niro eddie murphy rene russo fan it was worth seeing in the theater but not for full price i'd recommend seeing it at matinee price br br also here's some movie trivia for ya the guy who played the camera man played by judah is the guy in the music video everyday by dave matthews band he was also the clerk in meet the parents also starring robert de niro and on top of that he also played derek brother in zoolander both zoolander and meet the parents star ben stiller just some useless trivia for ya br br i hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris,1
3772,the movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole american system the of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world have become a way of life for americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end the story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it ain't happening leaves a lot for thought overall i enjoyed it,1
3773,i found this gem in a rack the local video rental store had of tapes which are exchanged among various rental outlets 'the man who down hmm never heard about it the box reads of some japanese fellow who always wanted to ski down everest and actually did it sounds interesting i rented it as expected it was documentary style the first part can be summarized so i always wanted to ski down mount everest this is followed by some footage of preparation for the event lots of preparation footage ok i suppose it takes a lot of preparation then we are treated to a protracted piece on the skier philosophy on life etc more filler follows and i begin to wonder where the skiing fits in to this show more preparation is shown and they begin to make the trip to the mountain more philosophy is shown at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing lots of climbing footage later there is a description of the parachute device intended to slow speed on the steep slope finally he straps on the skis and gets ready to go br br he's off he skis about twenty feet and his skis shoot out from under him he deploys the parachute and tumbles in an inglorious bundle for some distance down the mountain and that's that end of story what the heck was that br br ok i can buy that he always wanted to ski down everest made extensive preparations and actually tried it with camera crew in tow it didn't work and he ended up tumbling down and almost killing himself so what egregious hubris would inspire the man to release a film of it and call it skiing down everest perhaps the title the man who's feet shot out from under him and he slid on his ass down everest was just too long for the tape box,0

3775,for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet this film is completely ridiculous ivan kirov was basically a gymnast not a ballet dancer viola at the time was with ballet theater now american ballet theater and a reasonably good dancer but except for dame judith anderson the acting is amateurish and is completely over the top embarrassingly so i saw this film at age 14 and at that time never having seen a ballet i was very impressed however later in life long after i had completed my own career as a dancer i purchased the video tape of it curious as to what it was like after so many years i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet but it was made in the mid 40s before the red shoes or the turning point the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ivan kirov not his real name dying at age 79 it was his one and only film thereafter being kept by a chicago business man so the rumor goes,0
3776,the subject is world war ii and robert ryan is a rejected soldier whom lupino hires as handyman she is a war widow br br the set is limited but the acting makes up for this robert ryan is conflicted one moment he seems nice then confused about where he lives at first lupino tries to help him he seems troubled but nothing more dangerous but how do we know the suspense builds i truly enjoy films like this which rely on the human element for suspense what is this man capable of there are some scenes with o z whitehead and dee pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong we keep thinking she will be helped then ryan's personality turns again he becomes like a jekyll hyde character and eventually chases lupino with a knife br br worth watching for these two superb actors 9 10,1

3778,beware my lovely originated from a play written by mel who apparently liked writing about frightened women his first and best effort was the screenplay for the spiral staircase he also did a loretta young suspense thriller cause for alarm a couple of years earlier the play wrote was originally entitled the man and it ran for 92 performances on broadway during the 1950 season it was only effort on broadway and it starred dorothy gish and richard boone br br the roles that gish and boone played are taken by ida lupino and robert ryan for whatever reason rko thought to eliminate the age difference himself rewrote his play for the screen so i'm wondering what he thought about that certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story br br that wasn't the only thing that was eliminated the people are all wearing period clothing from around world war i yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in i thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to ida lupino's residence i noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era br br the film is almost entirely set within ida lupino's home where she's hired an itinerant stranger in robert ryan as a handyman the film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference it turns out that ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons lupino in her home for about a day br br both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made films like beware my lovely are the stuff that a small studio like rko did best if this were done at mgm or paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story,1
3779,i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus something i had not seen before br br i approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began the opening is well put together and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh and this is good br br however the humor soon became repetitive the plot became confused and strained and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film i have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it didn't i confess that i may have missed some of the humour not being jewish myself and having little experience with jewish culture however considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film it's unlikely i missed much br br the idea is a good one and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through i wish i could give the movie a higher rating but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full length movie br br one thing to say about the casting the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind but i don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it,0
3780,1980 is brilliant it's got all these qualities that made the late 70's movies so great it is proud of its directness and not ashamed of being over the top br br what really matters here is the journey not the destination ignorant idiots with soap opera mentality will never realize that is about the struggles anxieties and triumphs of these young people not about their careers br br ironically enough none of the very talented actors of made it in hollywood marked the end of an era the end of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness it's the last statement of a generation that had a voice of its own br br 10 10,1
3781,is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him br br okay our gang comedy works in fits and starts the bits work but i don't think it really works as a whole part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down i think in a weird way the film just sort of misses its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire worth trying if you lower your expectations,0
3782,at the beginning it was almost a shock to see norma shearer without her makeup then she glamorizes herself and becomes the life of the party br br anyway she divorces her husband makes herself over and gets on with her life or so she thinks somewhat keeps you guessing if they'll get back together,1
3783,the original grudge the original american remake surprisingly pulled off just about everything you could do right with a ghost flick it had suspense dark and moody atmosphere some good jolts and some genuinely creepy images the grudge 2 attempts all of these techniques but ultimately fails only showing us the same old stuff we saw in the first movie as well as a messy storyline constantly switching from tokyo to california it begins in tokyo with some schoolgirls who wander into the house now heavily blocked by one strip of police tape one of them comes face to face with a similar wide eyed ghost girl while trapped in a closet she gets out screaming frantically and they all run out of there next we cut to america where karen's sister is sent by their mother to japan to find and bring her back home we eventually find ourselves following a very familiar concept involving a curious guy and girl investigating the history of a mysterious house we cut back and forth to the girls from the beginning who are disappearing one by one as well as a young boy hearing strange noises in the next apartment at night all leading up to a very unsatisfying ending the scare scenes are dull and ineffective like the ring 2 avoid this god awful sequel,0
3784,goes to town was the second and last full length animated feature made by max and dave fleischer who created a parallel universe to disney while disney's films are well remembered today both of the fleischer films gulliver's travels and this one are forgotten br br is a spellbinding original not an adaptation like the first picture that is a major plus one would think no the critics rarely on the sides to begin with tore into them for this yes the story is not as tight as gulliver but how can you hate a film that flaunts itself so joyfully br br it is filled with great musical numbers and a very involving story which would be a crime to reveal the characters are lovable and charming and there is heart in this film br br the really outdid themselves here and never quite did so again most of their time would be devoted to one reelers after this tanked at the box office it's a shame they didn't continue making features who knows their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they were aiming for br br out of 4 stars,1
3785,this is a great movie to watch with a good friend boy girl friend or family basically one of those feel good movies you want to share with your loved ones without all the girlie crap you find in a lot of american feel good movies this movie is light hearted but makes you think and will make you laugh br br just a really simple but universal plot would think most people could relate in some way to this movie the characters in the movie are amazing and the actors do a great job in sucking you into the movie and the movie is topped off all along the way with hilarious true to life jewish humor i watched the movie for the first time last night and now i want to own it,1
3786,the opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible i've seen a number of sci fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and i looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly sensory overload the plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to subtly explain it the creatures in this movie are also very interesting you don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through overall a very entertaining movie,1
3787,this is by far the worst version of william shakespeare's tragic masterpiece i have ever seen it seems the filmmakers didn't actually read shakespeare's text no they just took what they wanted from the olivier movie the plot is out of order and slimmed down to its bare necessity yet there is time for the non canon olivier created incest hint between hamlet and queen gertrude could we have had the something rotten in the state of denmark bit instead casting is another issue i understand that the far superior branagh movie had its weak bits robin williams and charlton heston come to mind but this one has very few good moments i do like laertes and polonius but the rest of the cast is stale mel gibson's creepy stubble is irritating and one often wonders if he has any idea what he is saying many of the actors seem to have just memorized the part they know less about what is being said than sophomores in high school br br if you want a version of hamlet check out kenneth branagh's or even olivier to be frank even disney's hamlet is better,0
3788,with a humor that would appeal to an exclusive small audience the average viewer will find it pointless and monotonous when cartoon network advertised this show it was made to look as if it was a major drama or event complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep br br when it came out on the air i was disappointed at how all the characters were so one dimensional and a totally bland animation the only thing that put it to anything close to humor were the names of the characters like private public and general specific a few vague references to cultural aspects and how lady pummeled sheep with her steel wig br br slightly off topic but i don't see why would sheep fall in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called swanky it was hideous,0
3789,the banter and humorous rescue scene help to make this one of my favorites of the 14 movie series wonderful acting great cast and this movie contains one of the few oft noted facts about sean bean's career the part where he and alice krige fall off the horse into the water was not scripted but was left in since they both went right on acting after it happened br br this is a good follow up to the intense ending of sharpe's enemy,1
3790,this would have to be by far the greatest series i have ever seen i vividly watched every sunday night and purchased the box set as soon as it was available this is a timeless play written by a fantastic australian that people of all ages could relate to whether they are australian or not however for those of us that are australian it truly brings across the typical australian icon a must see 10 10,1
3791,i don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say but they badly failed at whatever it was unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer i watched this movie simply because drew barrymore was in it and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it the whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous,0
3792,strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an undercover fbi agent matthew modine flirting with a mobster's concerned widow michelle to tie two murders on a elusive mob boss dean stockwell br br the movie shows that it doesn't have to go over the top just to be funny and director jonathan demme the silence of the lambs philadelphia keeps the movie from looking like it being was restrained that's good and it avoids being too,1
3793,journey to the far side of the sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun which shares the same orbit as earth and therefore has been undiscovered until a space probe on the far side of the sun photographs it of course two astronauts roy thinnes ian hendry are sent to explore it but due to a malfunction they crash find themselves back on earth only 3 weeks into their six week journey of course they're berated at least thinnes is hendry is gravely injured and grilled and asked why they turned back on their mission but it's claimed that they didn't until thinnes seems to notice a few very odd things about being back home this is excellent if somewhat talky at times and the sets and feel aren't a far cry from thunderbirds territory but will live actors for once it's no big star wars type production but more quiet science fiction that one has to think about a bit well worth seeing and it's criminal that the dvd is out of print 8 out of 10,1
3794,there were only two redeeming features about this movie the beauty of bucharest and its architecture and the way they depicted the transformation from human form to wolf form forget about the plot or storyline from the book they're completely absent from this movie in fact about the only things carried over from the book are the names of the main players even then you'll barely recognize the characterizations if the film makers had made a good movie even though unrelated to the book i wouldn't have been so disappointed unfortunately they did not the plot and storyline are typical of low budget horror flicks the acting is wooden and the directorial efforts mundane oh yes the way the bow to their leader is pure hoke i suppose a nod of recognition is due for the animal handlers the wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles,0
3795,olivia d'abo in a wet t shirt is the only thing this movie has going for it other than that this canadian production about a man taking out a vicious band of hillbillies is not worth anybody's time the writing is bad the acting is poor and the direction is sub standard,0
3796,it was definitely worth viewing i don't regret that but also it was kind of ordinary something that i would expect from a movie titled like that love story was nice to watch humour was involved but nothing surprised or spooked me shooting tough guys etc ain't worth it any more,0
3797,robin williams is a national treasure specially when he cuts loose and puts aside his maudlin approach to drama he manages to liven up the usual restrained pacing of barry levinson and there are moments in this film when he truly shines br br as the funny elected american president in man of the year williams recaptures the hilarity and outrageousness that used to be associated with him what makes him so appealing is his humanity and likability here is a man who can lash at his audience but truly loves them too his humour is like barbed wire and yet it is cathartic it is what makes him very appealing to the people in the film and in real life br br laura linney is once again portraying an intelligent woman in distress she is a fabulous and very talented performer but i think she has boxed into a stereotype and unfortunately it would have been more interesting to have a less recognizable performer in this case walken pretty much walks through his thankless role and the climatic scene in the snl skit barely floats above water br br go in for a few hilarious moments and those are priceless enjoy williams and forget some of the deep moments that slow down this otherwise entertaining movie,1
3798,i cannot believe this show was okay ed first off j p does a horrible job filling in for david spade and voice is too deep compared to john goodman's the theme song is so annoying and the plots of the episodes are so stupid the only good thing about this show is that eartha kitt and patrick warburton remain as the voices of and this show is a waste of money and a waste of your time half of the episodes are copied of the movie in my opinion the emperor's new groove was one of the best children's movies in years but they ruined by making new groove and this show you should watch such shows as spongebob fairly oddparents danny phantom or kim possible but not this show,0
3799,do not miss this picture that defies ages with no hesitation a masterpiece not only the script and the music but also casting br br cut everything contributes to the perfect achievement now nearly 25 years ago and still amazing of maturity art and br br sensitivity available now in dvd do not miss either the is perfect br br and the sound re boosted one mystery remains about this superb work why the actors did br br not succeed better after this flashing start,1
3800,once again the posters lied to me br br the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content when i read the synopsis for this movie i was expecting to see a of grotesques every man jack of them bloodshot and bloated by alcohol peppered by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation into such a den of vice would come the clean shaven hero shining gabriel instead the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect br br the first few minutes of the film showed us that is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether fiddling a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching cock fighting chickens not penises to while away the boredom in other words the townspeople were desperately ordinary br br the only deliberate grotesque in the piece was gabriel the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by macfadyen whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury if i were kind i would suggest that the rantings of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith unfortunately brian kirk is so inept a film maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to fret their way through eighty plus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium my only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location are we surprised that ends up stealing his brother's child and suffocating his father of course not he's a bible bashing preacher and therefore psychotic all the townspeople stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but i suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to br br the northern ireland film and television commission have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace superman returns as the worst film of 2006 one hell of an achievement br br v2,0
3801,i never saw any of the work until early last year although when channel hopping one night i caught the end of one the series three episodes but last winter i fell in love with the show and its dark eccentric and sometimes downright sinister characters so when i learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters i couldn't order the dvd fast enough and near on tore it from my hands when he delivered it i was so excited to see what the gents had done and how they'd done it br br and it was excellent from the beginning where jeremy michael sheen is terrorised by edward tubbs and papa dyson why didn't you play yourself he's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous house of horrors know to bernice berating yet another one of her flock to geoff herr and hilary discovering that they are characters which is a great scene the scenes set in are very enjoyable with the gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot david warner's turn as doctor pea is fantastic slightly camp and very funny br br the league have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion and the climax of this film where herr is struggling with the idea that he and the other vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose and to witness how it's breaking him down is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the talent something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day br br and then you have that rather clever ending where you sit in wonder with joby beautiful theme music playing and you know you've enjoyed a very clever and funny film,1
3802,first off this film has no story it's obvious there were a lot of rewrites during production sometimes characters reference a timeline that is impossible and this is probably because the timeline of the entire story was never known to anyone on the set br br that said the film is kinda brilliant pfeiffer is amazing and i mean amazing as catwoman she nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good bad tendencies walken is walken but even more nasty than usual devito is not true to the comic book when it comes to penguin but he is good and memorable br br keaton is underrated as batman br br and the music and style are pure cinema thrill true the 3rd act doesn't work but the final 2 scenes are knockouts and it's clear pfeiffer and keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that got derailed by this film's kinky darkness that's too bad because pfieffer and keaton had classic chemistry and had they acted in a third installment joel you know who might not have gotten the chance to destroy batman for an entire generation of movie fans,1
3803,the word boring gets thrown around way too often when referring to exactly how bad a low budget horror movie might or might not be i've seen many a b movie many horrible terribly inept b movies some with a production value of a few hundred bucks does ineptness lousy acting worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable some would no doubt way yes most of which are probably huge fans of the matrix well i hate big budget movies so i say no bad can sometimes be funny blood freak sometimes even mind blowing troll 2 but boring will always be unwatchable hey kinda like bloodthirsty butchers which reminds me i'm writing a review for this pile of garbage uh yeah anyway this is one of late british director andy milligan's many alternatives to sleeping pills this one is based on sweeney todd great milligan takes a boring story and still manages to butcher it hey that's pretty funny i said bu sorry i keep getting distracted this isn't exactly easy on second thought i'll make it easy no gore no scares no entertainment just unlikeable annoying people having incoherent conversations that's bloodthirsty butchers oh yeah and something about a barber killing people and something or other about meat pies i don't know it's not important br br for something a little more rewarding from andy milligan there's always the only other one i've seen the rats are coming the werewolves are here yeah you heard me but hows about we forget about this milligan guy all together and pick up something sweet like sick girl or goes to camp whatever you decide just know bloodthirsty butchers sucks possibly even more than any other version of this already lackluster tale and that b movie fans is really saying something 2 10,0
3804,tokyo eyes tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop this lame flick is about 50 filler and 50 talk talk and more talk you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus talk and play video games talk and get a haircut talk and walk and walk and talk talk on cell phones hang out and talk etc as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value a meager cast and no action no romance no sex or nudity no heavy drama just incessant c,0
3805,simply beautiful one of the best mind umm screws in existence both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract moscow could learn a few things from the torture techniques in this film they could also do worse than hiring alan rickman five out of five stars and at present 1 20 2000 2 on my top 100 films of all time list,1
3806,this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it not much suspense it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film at the beginning when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something whats up with that the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a beatles concert even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy don't waste your time with this nuff said,0
3807,a blind person could have shot this movie better seriously the director is clearly a novice he must be dennis hopper's coke dealer or something to convince him to be in this movie i felt so embarrassed for dennis br br to john the director please retire from directing your contribution is not needed nor wanted the medium of film is stronger without you you are terrible at directing stick to bagging groceries or something br br this movie should've bypassed straight to video and gone to the trashcan i'm a dumber person for having seen this movie do not see this movie if you respect yourself and respect the of film,0
3808,one of the better musical bios dennis morgan is great as the singer composer chauncey the supporting cast is very good especially andrea king as the glamorous lillian russell the turn of the century atmosphere is the perfect setting the technicolor is excellent a simple plot but the movie just makes you feel good morgan was always underrated as an actor and a singer,1
3809,rented this from my local video store it was titled black horizon i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re release br br micheal dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat another major flaw would be that ice t's action scenes are stolen from other movies particularly the first scene of his rescue which is directly from the wesley snipes movie the art of war with ice t edited in i hope they paid for that footage br br the plot is awful the special effects had little effort put into them love those wires holding them in space the acting is wooden also love those new york russian accents ice t being in the movie is pointless these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space but i guess they weren't worried about it br br micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what he's good at and make american ninja 6,0
3810,rebecca de can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play if you cannot say something nice br br de portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a of course brilliant shrink she has an affair with banderas whom we suspect of being ouch how original a serial killer sometimes she recalls banderas's mother in law tippi hedren's character in marnie but i wouldn't count on it hitchcock died twenty four years ago and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end but that ending is so far fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it the movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murders human beings and cats split personality and open ending in case the crowds should call for more apparently they did not and they were right,0
3811,native chief's son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father the evil witch doctor orders to execute him he then comes back as a murdering tree well what can you say about such a film if it was intended to be a horror film there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved and for a comedy it still isn't funny enough i don't know why people make films like this i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it or you might want to see the incredible monstrous tree which gives a new dimension to a slow death or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved ms or the dialogue and screenplay which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year br br shouldn't we try psycho analysis on that tree maybe its mother was afraid of oaks 2 10,0
3812,a very great movie br br a big love story lots of sword fighting huge battle scenes heros and villains real history br br few in the west know much chinese history chin founded china the country is in fact named after him some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed this is a historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china he founded a dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since br br chin or the king of as he was known before he founded the empire was roughly contemporaneous with hannibal and in the west the parallel roman world dominance west and east worlds was achieved without a single towering personality like chin it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar the nearest comparable western figure br br chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into a ruthless despot history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be gong li is lovely she is the emotional core of the story it all makes for great movie making,1
3813,no matter what country your in you have to buy this show sure it is australian and if you ever seen any attempt of our comedy's they pretty much suck but with the they aren't boring forty year old men making bad puns they are a team of people who talk about current affairs pretty much in australia make fun of our crap ads make fun of our politicians and so on br br the guys also had a show in 2002 called which was not as successful as the war which had only started this year so everything they talk about is current news which is really good considering no matter how boring or tragic it is they try to shine some humorous light on things,1
3814,i'll not comment a lot what's to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some music it's beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people i mean the interpreters you'll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it it's the rap sing in the final credits pathetic doesn't it etc etc it has been a long time i haven't seen a movie so bad,0
3815,i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information score 6 7 well not so bad genre scifi good i like scifi so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it but but no br br as in summary this isn't a movie at all it is a religious advertisement including about jesus god devil end of the world etc movie starts with a epic abduction story driving at night car stops bright light and so on well actually that was the film last of this ummm frankly i don't know what to call it was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement quite a same stuff what these tv tell you but they are good at it br br honestly if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with ufos please stay far away from this thing it has nothing to do with them if you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do then go ahead and watch this thing but i still prefer going to the church at sunday br br this is complete bull and evangelical christian propaganda as another users said well i should have red another users comments before i got the movie br br 27 of voters have rated this thing as 10 yeah right please go somewhere else to do your propaganda,0
3816,i won't waste your time by describing the plot for this the other reviewer already did this quite well i will however give you my opinion of this movie this movie is basically anti japanese the japanese are portrayed as evil b tards who have respect for nothing as well as having very poor martial arts skills groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion the fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every if not every fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense the plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though the problem lies in the fact that there's not much fighting when there are fights some of the fighting is quite good but other scenes are choreographed badly one scene angela mao takes on six japanese in a church and kicks all their asses the problem is they show her fighting them one by one when they're all supposed to be attacking at the same time i gather this movie was cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are they use the same village set for when they are in korea and when they are in china without changing it at all some scenes are filmed at real locations though and they look good overall the only real problem with the movie is it's slow moving and uninteresting plot since there are few fight scenes we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and well i wasn't entertained br br one and a half stars out of four,0
3817,there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb com that i've disagreed with and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion br br reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for br br how else would one explain a review that this show is sure to become a phenomenon a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort br br i won't waste words describing this mess but suffice to say if you enjoy wives who emasculate their husbands husbands who emasculate their sons children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to characters that are basically just unfunny one liner spewing automatons then watch this show br br i on the other hand have some seinfeld dvds to get through br br futurama cancelled titus cancelled arrested development cancelled the war at home renewed br br no justice,0
3818,i must preface this comment with a sort of admission i suppose i just have a soft spot for the original 60s 70s tv series i think the filmmakers here blew it from the get go as far as casting in a supposed remake audiences would look for reflections of the hip athletic clarence williams iii or the cool with it michael cole and so forth instead we get giovanni ribisi as a poor little white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic like he is in all his roles in the office i used to work in i amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster casting various actors as members of the office staff guess who i cast as the dorky son of the company president danes does ok as the new julie but none of the characters have much to do as the story just sort of sits there mired in conventionality so it's quite forgettable besides what was i talking about,0
3819,after having spent a lot of my youth watching such movies i found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions although the story has much more to hold it together in the unedited version unlike ninja scroll this movie hit a much more serious note and i think that's where it hit me the animation while grainy is very original and i just love the way artists in that year stressed shadows to show different emotions i think the story is perfect the beginning of the movie really hits hard and as the movie progresses you get the feeling that you're going along in this adventure with the characters as they meet become allies and find out the their greatest strengths a lot of heart was put into this,1
3820,ah the classic genre of 80s sex comedies this is set on two beaches one a nude beach featuring myriad fully unclothed women the plot something about a bunch of attempting to get laid the usual fans of gratuitous t a and p should hunt this one down,0
3821,walt was particularly fond of quality so how come the producers at disney would release such a terribly edited roughly acted even for family fare mess of a movie the big green had a good concept and since it is disney you know how the movie is going to turn out obviously but the big green is horrible the jokes are lame and steve guttenburg still alive pulls in another terrible performance on his resume br br kids with too much time on their hands in small town are offered an opportunity by their new teacher to play soccer the kids don't know a thing though and gracious for us we get to see steve guttenburg try to hit on the teacher from beginning to end br br the speed up camera work does not work the big green is full of speeding the pace of characters to move the movie along kids are not idiots they will catch on if you give them enough of a hint without showing all that garbage guttenburg for once in his life should have turned down an offer to join this movie also the pretty olivia d'abo should have called this one off too the big green can be known as 'the big bomb ',0
3822,i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that with few exceptions they don't focus on the main disconnect hence the main split in the audience br br on the one side there are those who are taken by the visual design pretty costumes and variety of elements going into the film some children's movie fans love the colour and animation and all the un scary effects shapeshifting animals and so on some culture vultures like the complicated references the of different folklore elements and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi miming in two different languages in what really was intended to be a children's comedy br br on the other side there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point that a blend of is not a tale at all and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real br br in other words the ideas could be lovely but when you put them onstage they have to deliver here they don't br br a good from any country has a clear story a point and characters who interact strongly with each other this lacks them all a few over sophisticated gestures to opera western and japanese are no replacement for a solid theme br br as a fantasy fan i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few but this one really tries to do too many things cheaply putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome the other problem isn't that there's no plot there's half a plot which means that you keep getting pulled in then dropped again as another none too sharply executed dance number kicks off br br the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video this ain't good i'd like to test this on real children i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes,0
3823,one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario three absolutely pointless segments all featuring the director playing himself and he's not that interesting a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones br br the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith concert' prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album the best thing you can say about the director actor egotist is that he's got great taste in music,0
3824,an art teacher comes across an antique wooden bed made from trees and puts it in his apartment but it has a terrible history and he becomes hunted by a ancient spirit who sustains his human form by ripping the hearts out of people br br this beautifully crafted well actually it's more fantasy romance than anything else does raise some chills and provide some stunning visuals but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the formulaic script lacked any sort of life problem was that i spent most of the time trying to keep my finger away from the fast forward button it sure would have sped up the film's slow pacing but then again i wouldn't know about too much that was going on which was reasonably hard to figure out or keep interest in the first place the performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain dull and that's probably because these characters are unconvincing stale and coma inducing the actual back story of the old bed and the spirits is incredibly boring and messily put together with too much focus on a flimsy romance being laughable when it shouldn't be and overall it's constructed in an ordinary manner that just lacks the oomph or conviction to carry the film what compensates for the story's shortcomings are really arty images which looked grand but the use of some images had me somewhat dumbfounded to what they actually mean towards the film what catches your eye is the faded colour scheme but sometimes the actual screen would look real grainy or snowy although from that it shows the raw intensity of the production but also add some nice polished effects that goes well with the soothing but sometimes edgy score the camera work was pretty diverse although it didn't add too much to the feature but during some of the more upbeat scenes there were too many close ups or dark lighting which made it hard to understand what you are seeing also on show are some nice moments of blood and gore but not overtly grand or distinguishable from most other films br br lethargically odd film with luminous images that look like something out of a painting but still it isn't particularly enticing watch out it might put you in a deep trance,0
3825,had the fun pleasure of viewing a new independent film called half empty i usually go out to the local cinema with my husband and feel as if we are held captive to the latest sequel or prequel that hollywood throws at us this was different and surprisingly  so much more entertaining than anything hollywood spends millions advertising when my husband and i go the movies we go to be entertained  and half empty did just that and the film did so in a smart manner that made me feel as if my trip to the movie theater was worth it it is a funny human and surprising sometimes musical story that cleverly entertains in its simplicity i especially enjoyed the scene with the 4 men singing in harmony in the bathroom it is almost like an operetta that particular scene reminded me of a scene in phantom of the opera when 4 of the performers did not just i e they sang against one another in a friendly retort i am not a film maven but this film was more enjoyable than any other major studio film i have seen lately it is silly funny entertaining and amusing completely enjoyable  which is what i expect from movies but rarely do they deliver like half empty,1
3826,what's his name what clear br br that gag still gets me twenty one years after the film was released br br i loved the film back then and i love it today i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue br br madonna plays nikki finn a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit when she gets out she decides to seek revenge br br griffin dunne whatever happened to him plays an attorney for his fiancée's father john the future father in law asks to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus as part of a supposed new public relations programme a seemingly easy task but there are complications aplenty some funny dialogue and some admittedly stupid but funny scenes along the way br br madonna has a stupid voice in this film which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me hence only 8 10 but on the other hand i can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice br br this film shows madonna's comic side too lacking these days perhaps and she genuinely is funny in the role dunne makes a great foil while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancée br br yes it's predictable yes the jokes could be better but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more,1
3827,i used to watch this show when i was growing up when i think about it i remember it pretty well if you ask me it was a pretty good show anytime i think about it i don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i'm not sure if i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good,1
3828,gene roddenberry never let his fans down his death ended sci fi legacy that will never be matched earth the final conflict was proof his pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and meticulously produced but somewhere along the way the roddenberry touch was lost the loss of lead kevin kilner william boone definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work the story involves the human race being visited by the an extra terrestrial race who dub themselves 'the after 3 years they have given earth new technologies helpful information about the universe and more many question their intentions here on earth the main liaison on earth between the races is leni parker and he is to many the most trustworthy questions arise just why are they here what are their goals is aware of any suspected plots against the humans there is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist jonathan doors david who utilizes his millions to investigate the by the end of the first season things are going well seems trustworthy boone assists doors in his investigation while working with and the as a liaison in the middle of the 2nd season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward mostly because roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers of whom his wife majel barrett roddenberry was co producer still the first season remains intriguing and fun to watch,1
3829,i bought this movie for about 2 5 dollars at a local flea market i thought that with the cast present in this movie ice t rob lowe mario van peebles are all ok it would be pretty good boy was i wrong this movie annoyed the hell out of me almost every scene drags on too long the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie the rest is no either my guess is when they finished the movie they only had 30 minutes of film so they made everything last longer br br conclusion the current 1 9 rating here on imdb is right on the money this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen go watch some paint dry for 1 5 hour instead of watching this br br if you want to see some better movies made by this director watch with christopher lambert ice t or with charlie sheen instead,0
3830,duchess and her three kittens are enjoying the high life with their devoted human mistress until the wicked butler edgar with his eyes on a big inheritance decides to dope them and get them out of the picture how can these fragile creatures cope in the unfamiliar countryside and the meaner streets of paris only by meeting the irrepressible alley cat a rough diamond with romance in his heart after they get a taste of the wide dangerous world he guides them home and edgar gets his just desserts at the wrong end of a horse as always it's really the voices rather than the animation that are the heart of the disney magic phil harris is brilliant as eva gabor as duchess is well eva gabor but perhaps the most memorable turns are by pat and george lindsay who turn the old hounds napoleon and lafayette into a couple of bumbling southern fried rednecks their scenes with edgar and the musical numbers with scat cat and his cool dude band are classic most striking about seeing the aristocats now is how deeply disney's style of animation has changed since this was at the cutting edge in 1970 perhaps the nostalgic dated feel are just a result of being plonked down in belle epoque paris but the illustrations are a pity and the animation and overall pace much less frenetic sometimes a relief than in more recent efforts such as aladdin,1
3831,i really wanted to like this movie because it is refreshingly different from the hordes of everyday horror movie clones and i appreciate that the filmmakers are trying for something original unfortunately the plot just didn't hold together and none of the characters were likable enough for me to really care about them or their fates br br visually the was pretty interesting the director took a lot of somewhat risky moves like adding in little bits of flash looking animation in parts and really cheesing up some of the special effects such as the light from a certain amulet sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't but he deserves kudos for the attempt and the cinematography was generally of high quality br br unfortunately when this same approach of throwing lots of things at the wall to see what sticks was applied to the plot the results were not very good the film never really finds a tone that it likes moving from black comedy to family soap opera to 80's witchcraft flick to childhood nostalgia to embattled family slasher taken on their own bits and pieces of each of these elements work fairly well but nothing ever into a satisfying whole besides that large bits of the plot are never really explained i'm not one who likes to have everything spoon fed to me and i like movies that leave things up to the audience to decide but the parts that are left out from the just seem like they either ran out of money before they could explain them or they didn't really think things through to begin with br br i look forward to the director's next project since i think there is a lot of talent lurking under the surface here but i can't really recommend the on its own merits,0
3832,this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing antonio sabato is horrible i mean even worse than normal how does this guy work the directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films i love shark movies and this one just disappoints i've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work i'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story,0
3833,everyone has their choice for worst movie they've ever seen some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me it is problem child 2 and 9 years later i feel the exact same way it's not one of the worst it's not just an expression it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen br br how much farting pooping peeing and puking can you put in a single movie i don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist why is it that i'm so hard on this filth i have nothing against bathroom or gross out humor heck i like the american pie movies having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea but the true tipping point is to do it with kids having little kids call each other sexual names imdb won't even let me post that word on here yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds think of the irony in that and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier worst line in the movie i guess i should fart in more people's offices br br what other film has urination into lemonade dynamite sticks exploding toilets a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house and a little girl joking about scratching testicles br br however my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride says i'm gonna puke opens her mouth and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that br br i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried you get the impression that he didn't even have a script but was just being his usual self too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him br br you know what thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom goodbye,0
3834,before we start may i say i hope you've already eaten when you're reading this why because after i'd seen this film for the first time the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'the end' had appeared on the screen so don't say you weren't warned br br fred sears might have directed earth vs the flying saucers an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim burton's mars attacks but the giant claw is not that giant a film yes it's a prehistoric monster that flies in the air attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute the beast is giant except in the scenes where it's considerably smaller but who needs consistent proportions in a movie scary it could have been but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from sesame street,0
3835,this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss an obvious idiot a fat boy who never speaks and a woman who rotates between the three of them the group which is called satan's angels wants rod the driver as their personal driver he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot missing scene the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on she says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how she then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him the other three in the gang excluding rod run into the store they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day br br this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot,0
3836,having seen just about every movie on record that a child of the eighties could have seen this ranks at the very very very bottom of the heap of bad movies i have ever seen it's depressing and just plain painful to watch nuff said,0
3837,everyone i know loves this movie but i am afraid that i don't i hated this film so much that i had to turn it off mid film because of the repulsion way too much time is spent on and emotional bedlam the point of the bullock character being devastated by her divorce is jackhammered into the viewer's head excessively enough already and why didn't we hear more about her ex husband he is portrayed as nothing but a suit who comes by once in a while something must of made her want to marry him what was it what is it about him that makes her so devastated upon their divorce more time could of been spent on that rather than yet one more shot of bullock lying crumpled on the bedroom floor the dialogue is stilted cliched and terrible much like one of those corny abc afterschool specials or something there is no imagination or creativity about anything in this film it is all very predictable and therefore boring this movie also goes into overdrive on the factor very stupid and not funny like it was supposed to be this is just another one of those horribly done i am woman hear me roar films much like waiting to exhale if you want to see i am woman hear me roar films that are truly entertaining original and well done then see gas food lodging or ruby in paradise skip this crap i give hope floats 3 10,0
3838,broadcast news dir james l brooks 1987 br br br br although it lacks the emotional punch of brooks's debut feature terms of endearment broadcast news is a superlative film with exceptional performances from each of the three leads and a script that feels as genuine and well researched as a hard hitting news report let it be known this is a character film first and foremost and a satire second in my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms the film's characters are given surprising depth and dimension while the satire remains sly and never bitter comparisons to network are unnecessary because the films have two completely separate goals and attitudes while also a great film network is a cynical and weary work in other words its mad as hell and fed up with the state of television network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla in contrast the characters the news rooms of broadcast news love and live for their jobs sometimes to the detriment of their love lives they derive pleasure from the stresses and satisfactions of news reporting just as the audience derives pleasure from watching this sweet and romantically realistic masterpiece,1
3839,words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselves which were not executed well enough for a special effect so why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie mass consumers out there who care more about quantity than quality about cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesn't even deserve a capital letter underworld dracula 2000 dracula 3000 and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanatic on the other hand is obvious the vampire himself is romanian the story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincing and the atmosphere is not based on any action packed chases or expensive orchestral music himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romania include some typical vampiric elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in short if like me you 're fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and dark there's no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journals the brilliant spin off of the former,1
3840,you just cant touch the new crop is just awful the jokes are not funny some of the troupe make me want to stop watching tv all together lorne you have let your creation go down the toilet the guests sometimes are good the bands are mostly garbage weekend update seth has to tell the audience when to laugh seth would get a proper reception in a baghdad cafe though make sure andy goes with him the show has about 10 jokes in all and they just keep rehashing them over and over even the segments that are obviously not funny offending people has become the name of the game but they cant even do that right just offensively i am so disappointed with what has happened to the show but now i also know it is safe to go out on a saturday night,0
3841,this is probably the only movie i have ever not been able to make it all the way through not only was it annoying and boring but the low production values made it hard to make out the action and in some cases the dialogue avoid this one like the plague,0
3842,my friend zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store i still feel ripped off since i won't ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back having watched the first dark harvest the night prior to this viewing i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film wrong br br there isn't a single scarecrow in the movie unless you count the one of the cover of the box nor are there any real death scenes the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming god d n at her father br br there is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable believe me we tried,0
3843,this movie starts out a little slow but kicks into comedic gear quickly each of the three teenage girls offer their own believable distinct assertive and entertaining personalities i particularly enjoyed the dialog and interaction between keith and lisa if one looked beyond the superficial action that was taking place keith's character treated lisa's deflowering with tenderness and consideration the comic development that followed was also pulled in expertly in my opinion david boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult male who clearly gets himself into more trouble than he can handle dialogue was sharp quick and flowed nicely the director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got to claim the moral high ground after all the shenanigans they pulled although the movie appears light on the surface it reflects all the gray areas of becoming an adult human emotions and desire,1
3844,what a turd i like john leguizamo but man this is bad i thought spawn was the worst movie he had been in but i was wrong i like all types of comedy from stuff like ace ventura 2 to american werewolf in london this is a piece of trash,0
3845,maybe if you've never read any english literature or only ever watched the hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film it has the directorial and scripting skill of the bbc 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between elisabeth and darcy very well br br the characters in this production are badly miscast sutherland as bennet seems a total buffoon likewise acts the fool and it is that he my be a friend of darcy i can't imagine how judi dench could have accepted the role maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version br br quotes from the book are thrown in out of context huge chunks are missing the important episode with is glossed over br br mr collins is however very good and towers above the other members of the cast br br the only good thing is we didn't pay to see it wait for the dvd and use to keep a table from wobbling,0
3846,the ali g character works brilliantly within the confines of a comedy show but as a movie it doesn't work in the same way br br don't get me wrong this is a very funny movie full of biting witty dialogue that caricatures the modern british wonderfully well whilst providing the viewer with a hilarious if unrealistic story br br one problem with this film is that the script and content is either fantastically brilliant or it's embarrassing to watch when i say embarrassing i don't mean funny embarrassing a la office or extras but rather you'll wish they hadn't included it in the final cut one example of this is the inclusion of a music video after the film has ended to the tune of this is how we do it whenever i watch the film i stop the dvd when it says the end and leave it at that br br overall ali g is a good film worth watching a couple of times the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes however refinement is the key word here br br ali g is a better television programme borat is a better film,1
3847,this film was not great cinema but definitely a good film to see with your family especially children from 10 15 there are good topics of discussion brought up in this movie such as bullies the environment and working to make things right jimmy music was a plus and the scenery was wonderful the young actors were excellent and this is a movie i would expect to see on the family channel or the hallmark channel except for a few words in the dialog a middle school could show this film to start discussions in the classroom hopefully it will be shown in drive ins this summer so that more people get to see it it did follow carl book well and it was fun to see him in a cameo performance,1
3848,if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs i'm sure it would sound like this br br me four boys at a private high school are good friends and they are witches br br hollywood that sounds like the craft br br me no no i said four boys not four girls br br hollywood that still sounds like the craft just with boys instead of girls br br me ok but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power br br hollywood still not much difference because one of the girls in the craft also wanted more power br br me ok ok i'll make these boys part of the in crowd they'll be rich and the school is on the east coast br br hollywood now that sounds original that is nothing like the craft here's a billion dollars br br this movie was so cliché and uninspiring even the manufactured drama between chase and the brothers of was very blasé a bunch of rich kids with their biggest problem being what color bentley they want for their 18th birthday and 18th car don't interest me at all even if they have powers every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80 nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are i wanted to rename this movie the witches of o c oooh rich kids and their problems let me pretend to care br br this film was completely unimaginative and predictable the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti climatic this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor,0
3849,michael dudikoff stars as joe armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the u s army in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner which is hampered by too many long pauses without action but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as steve james' performance,0
3850,i saw this film one midnight and i can say that it worse than other horror film about a haunted house alexandra paul is not one of the best actress but she can do the role better the little girl get worse this is a example about a bad actress she has not got future in the great world of films sentence for house of the damned bad,0
3851,you looking for a comic drama with suspense and an ensemble cast well locate this little sleeper john lithgow and billy bob are great in this little plot twister don't forget the cameo by jamie lee curtis a touch of the 60's a touch of the prince and the pauper and dash of that homegrown gold makes for a little story,1
3852,this film was produced by producers releasing corp prc among the so called poverty row film studios of the 1930s and 40s so you can imagine how little money was spent making it br br the music is forgettable cast member young does exhibit an operatic quality voice but is sort of a discount deanna durbin the imdb database doesn't show any other film appearances for her so let's hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera br br the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies indicates this film has been preserved by the national film museum this immediately begs the br br are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve junk some low budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile this film has none br br in my opinion skip this movie it really wastes an hour of your time,0
3853,this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen br br i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism but this is supposed based upon a true character br br our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father he also has a doll fetish but i cannot figure out where that came from his co workers find out and tease him terribly br br during the day a mild manner accountant and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls they are all attractive of course else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist he graduates eventually to actually killing and that is what gets him caught br br like i said a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood,0
3854,this is probably the best movie from director hector it shows a brazilian reality unknown by foreigners which is the same reality that haunts all of the latin american countries poverty and a survival instinct the most affected in this reality is the children usually left orphans or abandoned by their poor parents have to make it in a dog eat dog society many times falling into the gap of delinquency prostitution and crime very well acted and with a no frills approach this movie will get to you great story plot a must have movie on anybody's collection the starring role went to fernando ramos da silva a young boy who fell into the crime wave killed some years later during a robbery i would suggest people to watch the movie who killed pixote so you can have a more in depth idea of the lives of these characters some other characters from the movie had a similar fate some died and others are in jail none the less this movie will last for a long time in your memory,1
3855,the notion of marital fidelity portrayed in the film seems outdated today but it is exactly the main characters' adherence to that notion which makes the entire story so touchingly tragic it is this notion that them and allows them to stand out to as they refer to their respective spouses not be like them br br as tony leung said in the film love just happens there doesn't need to be a rational explanation as to how it happens it simply does despite their not wanting to stoop to their respective level it happened fidelity social mores and timing all conspired against this relationship coming into fruition simply being in love is far from enough br br i had the misfortune of sitting beside a young couple still in university from the snippets of conversation they kindly shared with me throughout the entire film and uninitiated to the pains of lost love and missed opportunities their gross inability to digest the subtleness and the deeper emotions evoked made me realize just how much a film such as this as well as other wong kar wei's work is wasted on the local audience,1
3856,the make or break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable aloof braggart seemingly lazy and a misogynist he's been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable he by bragging that nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he can't show her who he really is she and then him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didn't seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed up br br funny things happen with the coach but matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesn't carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isn't the right size he's fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right,1
3857,a film that deserved theatrical release this made for television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of michael mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images always with mr mann the of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy award winning actor added to the ensemble of cast writer director and cinematographer br br this film is definitely one of my all time favorites while nothing is perfect this film comes very very close br br along with an excellent script great direction and masterful acting by richard strauss there is an all star ensemble of character actors at their finest roger mosely brian dennehy ed lauter geoffrey lewis richard moll miguel william prince burton ji tu richard lawson and billy green bush you may not recognize the names but you will recognize every face br br if this comes on tv sit down with popcorn turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film i highly recommend recording it since it is only available on vhs and dvd from holland and the dvd is region 2 encoded,1
3858,the plot in this movie is very thin and there is not much acting val kilmer i don't know why he agreed to do this movie plays a minor role as a gang leader in short the movie is tedious to watch br br one guy who sort of resembles an archeology religion professor is exploring a subterranean area of moscow that has some history connected to railway construction and the bolshevik revolution a church tragedy in that history makes the exploration spiritual and spirits of a malevolent intent haunt the underground ruins a friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of russian guides the entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground and some camera effects much like those seen in day watch night watch etc,0
3859,the most stupid of seagal's movies i've ever seen the final scene is just crescendo of stupidity my recommendation if you really like steeve seagal's movies never never rent or buy this one do not repeat my mistake and keep a good impression of him which i've lost,0
3860,travolta and thurman deserved a better movie this one is very secondary in all aspects not a single fresh idea but the biggest problem is this film's ridiculous philosophy a gang of black rappers after all their criminal activities and even killing people are becoming almost positive mickey mouse like heroes performing on stage and giving away awards at the ceremony perhaps this matches the real life but showing it as a quite normal happy ending is beyond my imagination what's wrong with shooting a couple of bad if they are not politically correct the show must go on that makes me think that hollywood writers have a big problem with separating good and evil even if the genre supposed to be a black comedy,0
3861,hello all you lovely dirty dancing fans i came across this message board when i was bored one day and think it's cool i absolutely love dd i first saw it at my friends house when i was 13 now i'm 17 and got hooked i saw it there at least 10 more times and soon after i bought the dvd for myself at this stage i have memorized most of the script and can recite it whenever anyone asks me about it carried a watermelon '' it's gotten so bad that i bought the soundtrack and recorded micky and song and now it's the on my phone most of my friends think it's a crap movie but i don't care what they think of it i know it's brill i was reading the comments earlier and i have a few questions for you lot 1 why are you asking trivial questions like what ages lisa and baby are i don't think it matters that much they are teenagers in the 60's isn't that enough 2 where did ye get this special edition that you're all talking about it sounds very interesting please reply to this i'd like to see other fans opinions cheers xxx,1
3862,this was made in 2004 for gods sake what happened to our state of the art special effects what happened to our rough around the edges but still good actors the actors in this movie were unbelievably horrible there was one or two that weren't bad but the rest thumbs down couldn't stand listening to the badly written dialogue i mean who the heck wrote that script please don't ever write again special effects don't even get me started on the special effects surely they could have come up with better then fully fake looking green balls of light in the eye sockets it looks so old and lame frankly even the easiest thing to make look real the teeth they looked so fake and stupid i would almost wipe a tear from my eye in annoyance come i cant believe this was even shown to the public,0
3863,showtime falls somewhere north of what some critics have been saying and a little south of what i expected months ago when i first heard about eddie murphy and robert di niro teaming up for a comedy overall it was pretty good as real life crime or cops go and plot for that matter it is pretty illogical but duh this is a comedy also while the special effects chases aerial shots and skyscrapers blowing up were present but lower key than a movie i found it a bit tiresome and overdone 9 11 sensibilities aside for myself all that pyro techno hyper effect stuff had been getting really old these past few years it seemed a lame substitute for characterization story and engaging emotions i hope the lesser quantity of it in showtime is an indicator of a trend in hollywood a trend downwards of less use of the silly less use of the exploding building br br di niro and murphy are two of my favorites their screen presence and charisma and even their character depth have been a joy to behold for many years that can't be dismissed here they are engaging actors and entertaining and appealing in this movie i can't put my finger on it but perhaps the explosions the excessive fx and all of that diminished the final product perhaps or perhaps it was something else or a combination of factors that gives one the sense that the movie didn't achieve its highest potential whatever it was showtime was entertaining i probably will buy the dvd when it comes out but i had the vibe that it nonetheless wasn't all it could have been at least not all i had hoped for br br very good movie but not a great movie i gave it an 8 out of 10,1
3864,it was good to see john denver again though he passed several years ago i found this film to be very heartwarming and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winters night recollecting what christmas is all about the scenes of georgetown colorado were magnificent and make one want to move there immediately as i sit here in my own mountain seen in so california i loved the story and the plot i hope all who see this somewhat older film enjoy it as much as my mother and i did merry christmas a great film for all the family too see enoy and tell others about it thanks for the memories we need to have more films like this come out of hollywood,1
3865,i bought this in the budget department last week i had halloween and halloween ii already and since i aim to collect every horror film ever i chose this after all the 1st two were good br br this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth it seems to create the correct atmosphere and has a nice history of michael myers it uses the old locations from the original and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in 1978 br br the climax also is fairly satisfying anyways it is a lot better than h20 which frankly is absolute crap,1
3866,if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it you have already wasted too much time over this stupid idiotic awful movie br br it's a horrible horrible horrible copy of the movie ' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it and it has govinda how bad can it be but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense i couldn't take it any more and turned off my computer br br overacting by everyone in the movie stupid dialogues total time waste i gave it a 1 star rating because that's the lowest you can do if i could go lower i would have given it a 100 rating,0
3867,this movie has everything typical horror movies lack although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for dare i say oscar winner this is a perfect date movie i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person,1
3868,i just saw this movie on showtime in the wee hours of the night i was viewing the beginning with one eye open but instead of drifting off to sleep i became invested in this crafty nail bitter of a movie it was very believable and engaging i could have done without so much profanity as with every david mamet movie i see but thoroughly enjoyed the experience i know teenagers swear but i don't need to listen to it anyways the story had some interesting surprises which i won't reveal but if you have a chance to catch this movie on showtime i think you will enjoy it as much as i have,1
3869,i saw this on dvd with subtitles which made it a little frustrating to get through because of the film's length but i was riveted throughout all of it that i was fascinated by the characters and always engrossed in the story despite the subtitles is a testament to the film's power it's an amazing piece of work i have it on my list of ten favorite films of all time it's easily the best foreign film i've seen in the last twenty years or so i would like to know the full story behind the making of this film it must have taken a very long time and required the use of hundreds of locations its use of some hardcore scenes on the tv in the motel room may unfortunately make some people choose not to see it but if you don't mind those you'll be deeply moved by all the stories in this one,1
3870,unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level romance novel writing gets sluggish treatment although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott thomas were fine slick production holds interest even though the plot keeps covering the same ground and never builds any emotional momentum as a result the climax in the airport is a big 'so what ',0
3871,this movie was sooooooo sloooow and everything in it was bland the acting the plot etc it was such a disappointment since the description looked so good do not be fooled this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it,0
3872,i honestly can't believe that this film isn't more highly rated claude chabrol could be described as something like a french alfred hitchcock and while this film is only the second one of his that i've seen the first being le i can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films the film is a french and canadian co production and takes place in canada the cast is made up of british and canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film most of which is high quality also the film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood is brought into a police station after being questioned by inspector it emerges that the young girl patricia and her sister muriel were attacked by a man who killed the sister and only just allowed patricia to flee however as the investigation goes on patricia goes back to the station to give new evidence which reveals a far more shocking identity to the murderer br br the performances in this film are excellent donald sutherland is subdued as usual but he suits the role he's given here very well and i wouldn't hesitate to name his performance in blood relatives as one of his very best the film also features supporting turns from british stars donald pleasance and david hemmings who both give good turns pleasance in particular who shows just how great an actor he can be and highlights what a shame it is that he went on to waste himself in halloween films the unknown landry also gives a great performance in her role as patricia the movie is very mysterious for the first hour and really keeps the audience hooked when inspector discovers muriel's diary the film turns into more of a drama in which the girl's last actions are shown and while this section of the film is not as good as what went before it it's still interesting and leads into a great twist at the end overall blood relatives is a great film that really deserves to be better seen le is a better known effort from chabrol but for my money this is at least as good highly recommended viewing,1
3873,the thomas crown affair is a terrible remake of a not very good movie redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russo br br that's it the plot is negligible pierce brosnan phoned in his part and dennis leary as usual plays an annoying irish cop but i couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful ms russo there's an okay love making scene on a stairway a terrifically sexy ballroom dance a topless beach scene and a roll in the sack oh and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a gets sunk br br but let's hope other directors recognize ms russo's perky attributes and cast her in more highly visible roles,0
3874,with sam waterston in the title role and with david suchet as teller is an example of the docudrama at its very finest well written well acted by actors who bear a believable resemblance to their historical characters highly informative and very entertaining the set designs and costumes capture the feel of the us during world war 2 and the plotting and dialog make the viewer feel as if he were really present at los and caught up in the excitement of the manhattan project the only downside is that this is a british production and some of the actors lack skill in affecting a convincing american accent the skill of current day australian irish actors taking on non native dialects is amazing the storyline is fully consistent with richard definitive history of the development of the atomic bomb sadly the mini series was shown only a couple of times on pbs at the beginning of the 1980s and then apparently vanished into oblivion br br compares favorably to the more recent 'fat man little boy' feature film with paul newman as leslie the chronically overweight and rather homely general would be thoroughly flattered and dwight schultz alumnus of tv's 'a team' as oppenheimer as a mini series is around 4x as long as the newman feature but uses the all of the additional time completely to its advantage,1
3875,think like a dinosaur was an well produced executed show of the series the actor enrico as michael burr plays an impressively well and convincing protagonist role you can actually identify yourself with him and his feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for because he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until kamala comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported he then consoles her and let's her know it's all going to be alright which ends up being an deception to both of them more so something bad occurs and she prototype comes back and her clone is sent to the other inhabitant planet although the dino and micheal have yet to find this out when they do it's up to michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her kamala was very much related to what happen to his wife his wife died similarly this show professes and sorrow thru out most of it after the show you're left pondering about what should have been done and you're stuck with the 50 50 of what's right from wrong hence the balance equation being solely there is no one br br 10 10 highly recommend watching this show,1
3876,i have an affection for these twists on british social norms and it is rare that one loses me but our betters did lose me a bit it's a tale of social climbers and their joy at breaking the rules but personally i found it a little dull br br i liked the duchess though she whines a little too much and constance bennett amiably fills the role of lady a role that bette davis could have played backwards br br but the movie comes the life in the third act when ernest joins the party he is so lively and fun and in truth probably wears more makeup then lady he gets the last line of the film and it's a gas,0
3877,the '70s were a great time for horror movies the brotherhood of satan is yet another overlooked gem it's full to the brim with great surreal unsettling scenes it's also great to see martin and l q jones who also produced in decent roles br br some of it is a little dated and cheesy but the brotherhood of satan kicks butt over race the devil and many other '70s satanism flicks,1
3878,for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of 2004 it was a huge disappointment shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make over emotional melodramatic movies the film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected the plot was that transparent granted if one himself was korean one would perhaps get into it more but for me it didn't do much anything suffice to say that as the case tends to be with korean cinema the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula south korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from death sentence prisoners to kill kim il sung br br a tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either they are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in korean cinema too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant one dimensional cardboard cuts they should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are br br one thing it does remind us of is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong,0
3879,when the movie first started i thought cheesy the first ten minutes were really boring after the slow beginning and some of the soap opera antics i started liking it the plot was different than anything i had ever seen now was it a horror not really it shouldn't have been as a horror or the producers should have put more money into the movie to make it scary as it was the creatures where only there for a short time i can only assume this was for money reason br br the good side was that the movie was very entertaining it held my interest after the start and did make me wonder about creatures from another dimension br br it was obvious that this was a first time movie for the director but there were a couple of highlights by the end i was hooked too bad hollywood didn't put more money behind this,1
3880,the king of queens could be divided into two eras br br the first era constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck br br the second era increased the scope of the show addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin br br but besides all of that br br this show was freaking hilarious br br kevin james when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with leah was unparalleled on tv br br jerry stiller as the psychotic live in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor and patton as the man child spence was amazing he's a great comedian too the king of queens was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air and it's a damn shame now all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning,1
3881,i must be honest i like romantic comedies but this was not what i had hoped for i thought ellen degeneres was having the biggest part which should have been because i didn't like the two struggling bed partners it was awful poor tom selleck he had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and ellen to be in most of the film they were the only believable ones and the only really funny parts starred them not kate capshaw and that everett guy cool that mummy is coming out of the closet i thought that was a nice surprise br br i'm just glad i saw it on the cable and i didn't pay any money renting it,0
3882,i think rosemary's baby is the most overrated horror film out there not scary interesting or much of anything it's reasonably well directed and ruth gordon was wonderful but that's about it but this sequel makes it look like gone with the wind br br i caught this on tv back when i was 14 unfortunately i still remember it from what i remember rosemary's baby andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over the world that is but there are forces trying to stop it and andrew is having doubts himself br br i'm giving this a 2 for a few reasons gordon is in this and still very good stephen mchattie was actually pretty good as andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with rosemary patty duke being kidnapped by a bus with no driver br br other than that it's dull silly and needless the original didn't need a sequel ira levin's book followup in 1999 wasn't much better br br tune in for the beginning with duke then tune out not worth the effort,0
3883,honestly this movie is weak very weak only capital character can something she's work like on bad engine so if you like red haired valkyries see that but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop it will save of disappointments well arnold also do his deal but it definitely not best his role other characters bad is not that word sword fights monsters ridiculous plot is really shame why was necessary rape she especially we don't see it br br anyway movie is weak though worse movies exist without main characters it would be just and if somebody even discusses it maybe,0
3884,okay this wasn't the greatest horror movie i've ever seen in my life despite the fact that it's lower budget it's a pretty decent movie though the monsters are unique and believable heck they're even kind of scary in the scenes where they show them briefly wreaking havoc on this poor family although when you finally do get to see the monsters completely you really think wtf those itty bitty things are after them the only part that really disturbed me is when sniff they killed the kitty not the kitty noooooo why seriously though if you are looking for hardcore violence and gore this is not the movie for you go rent the hills have eyes or something along those lines if you have small children i wouldn't recommend watching this with them though probably would give them nightmares about trolls in their room,1
3885,a very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution ian mcshane is right at home playing the soul loving dj who gets canned because he won't go along with the program and sets out to let the world know what they're missing the supporting cast is great as well and the music is the soul of the film i just wish that the film would be released so that i could get a copy of this for my film library,1
3886,well i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival the reaction to it was let's say as funny as the movie is it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish it was all confusing the genders were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and i remember great lines but because they were so absurd all in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead visible secret is your film,0
3887,this movie surprised me the box is misleading the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading the movie is quite gory well acted and beautifully shot the special effects are top notch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like it's tone would suggest it is a unique take on the dr moreau story and one of the better versions filmed the first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesn't ever really fall apart definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of dramatic costume horror classics and gore fests,1
3888,what's the matter with you people john dahl from rounders and unforgettable too quirky knocking emma thompson and alan rickman for having fun playing against type and somebody liked the gingerbread man br br i rented this not knowing anything about it and found it about as nifty a video find as you can get never insulting well thought out funny scary i disagree with the naysayers clearly i thought the story itself was unremarkable but the great cast which most likely means the director was paying attention lifted it to super cool status good sound design also much more appreciated in surround but i'm not bragging and yes i'm a girl so maybe it has a slight female slant the guys in the gang are pretty worthwhile all in all a 9 and a hearty recommend,1
3889,my wife and i saw every episode in this series and loved it however the series was cut short without a final episode by the producers of the show it ended with a typical end the season cliff hanger leaving it's fans feeling cheated a waste of great writing and acting,0
3890,killer flood the day the damn broke 1 10 finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof even by the low standards of disaster movies excuse me allow me to correct myself even by the low standards of made for tv disaster movies this is truly awful where do i begin br br the dam may have once seen a photo of a dam but i doubt it most especially large ones that generate electricity have oh i don't know a power plant nearby some gates for water to run through heck even a high tension electrical wire or two br br the dam is also somewhat two count them two employees staff the entire dam all three shifts and the employees were apparently imported from a clichéd ridden world war two film as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of floating by heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description br br the special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photo's of the town in a method that makes a sixties godzilla film look like the matrix a three year old drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film br br needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead this is no diamond in the rough this is the rough so is it a guilty pleasure killer flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine avalanche the swarm meteor it is also doubtful that michelle green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great henry fonda being pelted by that are supposed to be killer bees check back with me in,0
3891,i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim shot the movie three br br i did some swell pictures for him one of which i was told became the poster for the movie i didn't see the film until years later i thought it was bad a pity because the elements that went into it were compelling porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as rampling herself asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice i said sure but i had to return to ny promising i'd be back alas i never did get back one of life's unsung melodies br br i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere br br rowland,0
3892,the main character has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre film past he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally too long a movie too much time spent on inexpressive face too much road time one of the of tv filling time with moving cars trains etc long scenes of him doing trivial sometimes totally inexplicable trivial actions with neither reason or emotion his best friends joseph and domino are not much more their relationship based on sex this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase gratuitous sex domino and mother are the two characters who display some emotion but not much it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie is it indifferent acting indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting characters in this film talk very little to anyone it's little wonder their emotionally isolated which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other,0
3893,only the brits could make a film like this and have it be so tastefully charming betty brenda blethyn wants something more out of life but she doesn't know what when she realizes she is in love with her childhood friend boris alfred molina who owns the local funeral parlor meanwhile an american mortician christopher walken who wants to put the 'fun' back in funerals moves into this small welsh community with his assistant lee evans and wants to give boris a run for his money with flashy themed funerals star trek funeral anyone brenda and boris decide to stage death and funeral with hilarious results a very enjoyable film if you're a fan of british comedies such as waking ned devine you'll love this,1
3894,it worked director christian duguay created a very clever action spy thriller the actors donald sutherland and especially aidan quinn gave a top performance what a pity that we see aidan quinn in others movies like this one till now he was simply the best in the role as ramirez carlos for what he should have earned the oscar the picture was very nice the scenes are fast paced from beginning to the end and the story doesn´t let you a chance to get bored the movie is too underrated and i recommend it to anyone otherwise you will miss something great believe me you will not be disappointed that´s why i give it 9 10,1
3895,time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves there are of course complications the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery there are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones its not a bad film its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment normally i'm forgiving but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible worth a shot in a forgiving mood and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong,0
3896,a really funny british comedy from the mid 1950's about a school for girls the girls are all involved in mischief and mayhem making bathtub gin smoking and gambling alastair sim plays headmistress in a glorious drag role as well as playing brother a female police officer goes to the school undercover to see what is going on this film is funny having great sight gags and alastair sim is great just a classic britsh comedy lots of fun and not too cruse joan sims ans sid james stars of many carry on films play small roles but this film is about the girls it spawned 3 sequels and a recent re make watch and enjoy where it all began,1
3897,technically i'am a van damme fan or i was this movie is so bad that i hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes do not let the name isaac florentine undisputed ii fool you i had big hopes for this one depending on what i saw in undisputed ii man was i wrong all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero but i guess we wont be able to see that soon as our hero keep coming with those going to a border far away town and kill the bad guys than comeback home movies i mean for god's sake we are in 2008 and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level why do your self a favor skip it seriously,0
3898,this short movie intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultured shock the film presents the condition of average romanian in democratic romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period and if you want something you must bribe around to get it br br so our main character is fired after a long while he is around 50 and needs to get a similar job but the only job available is one inferior he is forced to take it because the lack of money br br my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems,1
3899,good actors good director well acted well directed but where's the movie did they have an script or just improvised it all at least it is a short length movie only 80 minutes including credits nothing seems to happen in this film nothing at all a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles but you'll never get a clue of what's happening nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie tons of f 's and motherf 's but nothing else br br for the people who love abel ferrara's films such as the funeral 'r xmas is going to be a big disappointment as it's been for me what was he thinking about did he really think that this was a good movie and if he didn't then why did he made it,0
3900,like a lot of films from the early sounds days cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment the hammy acting of lead richard dix nominated for best actor can be excused as a relic of the silent film school of acting however even giving benefits of the doubt cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact the film is two hours and four minutes it feels like four hours when you're watching it there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days in my opinion cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little ceasar cimarron is barely remembered today and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win,0
3901,hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse 1976 and now only seems to do by the numbers hollywood thrillers br br this is very lightweight john grisham material crossed with the plot of a tv movie bullock is cass mayweather a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy and together they make an uncomfortable duo not good when two unbalanced college maladriots gosling and pitt decide to send them on a wild goose chase by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene br br fair enough but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass's history then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there's absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set oooh the atmosphere br br watch any episode of csi instead it's to the point and far more exciting,0
3902,dear friends i've never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons 1988 it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi 1978 or george a romero's return of the living dead from the same year the cinematography was lousy the movie was very dark so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum indeed horror pictures have to be dark but not the way like night of the demons the entire movie was ridiculous no suspense worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger and horrible make up effects an average vote of 5 stars for that movie i can't believe this perhaps the users were pleased about the tits asses and pussies of the actresses they were indeed worth 5 stars regards hans dieter,0
3903,this is a parody that means there are no characters as such they are all plain stereotypes and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes br br well there are quite some good jokes in this movie unfortunately they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones if one expects all dialogues to be absurd the fun wears off br br you see there is american pie 2 my all time favorite teenager movie it contains a lot of real original characters maybe the jokes are tasteless but all the people have some kind of live for example they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny br br not so this movie every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody so there are no characters at all therefore there is really no room for any sympathy too if you know the original movies you know whole scenes in advance add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie br br the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film br br ah and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene sigh she is just too cool she can't be real hmm worth a whole movie,0
3904,i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie oh well had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging eating camel dung well actually eggplant and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking or if he was at all i can't believe they actually went to england and wherever to film this could have been done anywhere would have been better if they had managed to get her naked the best line of the movie he waiting for his upgrades yup still waiting now that was funny if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog beyond the narrator shut up already then i'll watch it again,0
3905,let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie i only sat through it because i was trying to kill some time before going to work br br basically it's your typical sophomoric comedy aimed at the teenage set there's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a carnival cruise liner through obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie it's supposed to be funny sadly it mostly fails on that count as well i must admit that i laughed a few times but mainly in a holy sh t i can't believe how stupid this is kind of way br br if you never see this movie you're not missing a thing,0
3906,i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy even though i've liked alvin and the chipmunks for a long time i was was very wrong it was great it has been the best movie i have seen since october in my opinion it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season enchanted i thought anyway was awful the golden compass was alright but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark materials fans and i am legend well i haven't seen that yet or national treasures 2 but it looks alright br br i'm not about to give anything away but this movie is great for anyone especially kids,0
3907,the main attraction of anywhere but here is the superb performance of natalie portman she gave her rather thankless character a lot of much appreciated emotional depth susan sarandon a fine actress is suitably sincere as the mother figure i thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script i am not saying the script was bad in any way i am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times i don't think it was the script writer's fault the film did suffer from being overlong and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes the film does look beautiful with some good direction and excellent performances all in all watchable certainly but maybe more for an older audience 7 10 bethany cox,1
3908,i thought that the interplay between crystal and devito was great the movie is rather off the wall but there are some unforgettable lines ramsey as momma is vulgar and over the top but also very funny and effective the character has to be pretty awful for why else would someone entertain thoughts of killing his mother now crystal's wife she is a slut whom everyone would like to receive her comeuppance thus her role though minor is also effective because it has to justify crystal's ridiculous case of writer's block while there are certainly dark moments the movie is not depressing and despite the murderous urges that the protagonists feel they have redeeming qualities too br br overall this is one of the funniest movies i can remember one that i don't mind watching over several times,1
3909,this nifty little movie demonstrates the rock solid virtues of a time place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have the saint is a with only the best motives to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction no need to turn up the volume or read the dialog george sanders is so charming and yes low key that all that talent smarts physical presence and above all masculinity seem well almost normal some normal george clooney can not begin to master the scene as mr sanders does and does without mr clooney's mugging he could play a witness the ghost and mrs muir and rebecca but when he was good he was very very good truly a man for all reasons and seasons,1
3910,in the only act of commonsense they have ever made the film television office refused to fund this film the producers kicked up a big stink in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria apart from the lost work for technicians were lucky not to have been involved br br the film fails on just about every level the post modernism fails the casting fails what is rose byrne's character all about which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel what the hell is pia miranda's character doing and the story is a clichéd mess of contradictions in fact the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line br br it might have had a chance if the pop culture meets depression style was better thought out and executed if the casting was quirkier if the style was less serious if just about everything was different br br apart from the usual excellence in costume design cinematography like most australian films the film is just a total miscue br br at a reported budget in excess of the tender hook is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded compare this mess with noise under or cedar boys under and you get the idea the tough interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks br br the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film,0
3911,i have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of forgetful disappointing pointless garbage tv show hell br br the skyler guy who is the host star creator of this show is boring uninteresting unbelievable not particularly good looking and not at all funny in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant seriously this guy needs to go away glad this show got canned,0
3912,cute idea to have dionne warwick do the song vocals for this movie adaptation of jacqueline bestselling book a la valley of the dolls although it's really too bad this sudser doesn't have patty duke's o'hara to spike the story the love machine is unrelievedly dull even the final brawl with an academy award as a fight prop can't save it dyan cannon seems embalmed in her heavy pancake make up and cumbersome fall although her tiny figure is a beauty to behold john phillip law is a block of wood in the lead david hemmings embarrassing in gay mode as a flamboyant photographer and where is robin stone walking to at the end is he trekking out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors after cannon has deflated his masculinity it would be a safe bet in that case love machine the final episode might've been a more interesting flick certainly better than this yawn inducing snooze opera 1 2 from,0
3913,the film is somewhat entertaining but the greatest feature is shalom harlow's laughable performance it has been 4 years since this movie was released and hopefully harlow has gone through more training perhaps she should stick to the more worldly somewhat characters that she has generated in other performances,0
3914,when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before ok so people in this one need to lose weight most americans need to lose weight i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk i don't know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence,0
3915,grim instead of amusing mean spirited instead of playful boring instead of interesting it won't give you the willies but it just may gross you out or send you to sleep and it will certainly make you wonder what were they thinking 1 2,0
3916,i had been avoiding this movie for sometime because i viewed it as an unneccesary installment to a series that should have only had 2 parts but after reading some fairly favorable reviews from some imdb watchers i spent 1 50 and rented it at my local video store need i go further when i say this was a buck 50 lost this movie is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen first off i realize that noone wanted to see a 33 year old macchio in this film but why could'nt they have had miyagi read a letter or something from daniel san maybe explaining what happened to daniel hell they could have at least made a quick mention of daniel or something but no and to the already bad script they added those stupid monks i thought monks take a vow of silence guess these yapping monks don't take their vows seriously hehehe the training the girl went through in the movie was hurried and stupid and the paramilitary group of young males were a confusing concept to say the least this was far from even being a martial arts movie with the girl only fighting briefly in the final scene and then she didn't even come close to getting hit even once by the male fighting her give me a break she would have gotten hit at least once i guess the writers and directors thought it would be to shocking to see a girl get punched by a male in this one i could go on and on but basically i'll end by saying that this movie was just so bad even the girl they chose wasn't nice to even look at she was sorta butch looking i can only think of a handful of movies that i have sit through that compare to just how bad this flick was don t waste your time on this one,0
3917,as a serious i was seriously disappointed in this film its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon or novice following the stories of 2 first time one senior one injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the chicago marathon the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is for lack of a better word boring while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of the brief history of the boston marathon and in general let me emphasize these were brief watching some joe runners prepare for a saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring and the nonstop clichés about achievement and feel good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter if you are a first time this film may give you a feeling of i can do it for anyone else run away,0
3918,daft potboilers don't come much than this but it's a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesn't based on a sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd c douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor it's got more uplift than a bra br br rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman a widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it no it quite that daft he had planned to become a doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in love br br try as i might i can't quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk's films this one isn't too deep on the plus side rock hudson isn't half bad i think i am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirk's films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms this is definitely daytime tv,0
3919,while it's one of two movies on tales of voodoo volume 1 there's no voodoo or anything supernatural in it the box labels it hell hole but the screen title is escape from hell hole the title is confusingly similar to hell hole 1978 aka escape from women's hell hole a group of women bathe in a river and seemingly the worst thing they have to worry about is a peeping tom who they easily overpower no nudity in this or any other scene however br br a woman named drives up in a car and seems to be known and liked by all the women she invites to come and live in the city with her and her uncle m g once they get there it becomes clear that m g wants to take virginity m g runs some sort of house of prostitution and he's either in charge of a corrupt branch of the military or runs a paramilitary outfit or prefers for his guards to all wear military style uniforms br br the women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble get put into a prison gets sent there the women get tortured and sometimes possibly raped by the guards br br various unsuccessful attempts at escape or rescue are made but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages the women have they outnumber the guards vastly and relatively few of the guards have automatic weapons most have semi automatic rifles or handguns br br wip genre enthusiasts may like it and the fact that it was made in the philippines gives it some novelty but otherwise eh,0
3920,1st watched 3 17 2002 2 out of 10 dir mario silly sex filled master slave having too many intimate relations movie this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti slave statement or should i say one line what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash,0
3921,i saw this movie years ago and i never forgot it the theme is very timely it was on tcm this morning and i am wondering why this wonderful film is not on vhs or dvd i have searched extensively for this movie but cannot find it i believe that if enough people request it the movie will ultimately be put on dvd it amazes me that such a stunning performance from quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public the fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike this film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as crash from previous comments i can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone again too bad it is not available for sale,1
3922,this don siegel clint eastwood strange and hypnotic drama was left by the wayside in 1971 and what a pity a fascinating character study with some great women for squint to deal with geraldine page was one of our supreme actresses and she's perfectly cast young jo ann harris is a flirty minx and elizabeth hartman who died too young is undeniably repressed br br a 7 out of 10 best performance c eastwood released the same year as dirty harry this did no business beside getting some good reviews seek this out unless you're only into explosion films very subtle and frightening this piece will stick with you,1
3923,ugh stephen baldwin i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits double ugh what's worse he's the name in this low budget mindless wandering wannabe shoot'em up i mean where did they find the guy to write this refuse driving a caterpillar in the la city dump while hoping to break into the movie game the whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for american gothic sans pitchfork his whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it br br so there you have it folks bad script bad acting by no name actors low budget setting and a hero that's about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero it's too late for me to get my money back on the dvd but you can spare yourself unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh frankly this one is too boring to be funny,0
3924,what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid so undeserving so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's cgi effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them with that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction well guess what the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next episode what a let down but wait there was even a bigger one the script itself was the bigger disaster and then there was the direction and the flaccid acting by everyone involved in this turkey but we knew this before right we knew that effects alone do not an entertainment make but yet the network bozos who this tv movie didn't care about that because in their mantra is the everlasting line never underestimate how stupid the audience are these guys must actually live by this motto and i am so fed up of it no wonder the audience has abandoned us drama in droves and pitched their camp in reality shows at least in those programs no one is trying to make it look like anything different from what it is intellectual pornography well category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and original yes this was a disaster movie alright but the disasters are not what they advertised,0
3925,a couple of men are ship wrecked on a remote island they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife br br the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way in fact the film in general is completely lethargic it just seems to drag on and on and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard pressed to care by that point as an example of 60's gothic horror this is strictly a bargain basement example i sadly can't recommend this one really,0
3926,have just got back from seeing this brilliantly funny film br br granted part of the reason i loved it so was because i could point out people and places i knew 'i walk there everyday ' 'i work there ' 'i've had drinks there ' 'hey that's our postman ' etc but still if you're out for a 'feel good' with a bit of spice excuse the pun this is just the right answer relationships culture and most importantly love are all woven together within the plot br br with preston where the film is set recently being made a city it is good to see this work featuring the place and adding to the feeling of it is also a brilliant representative of the many cultures in this part of the north br br fabulous,1
3927,all you could ever hope for if your a jackass fan as always knoxville his crew risk life limb just for our viewing entertainment if you are fan of the series of the first movie you won't be let down like most sequel often do the jokes they pull on each other as twice as funny cruel crude as ever before the stunts dares are twice as rough as any jackass episode you have ever seen if your a fan don't waste time go check it out for yourself because on standards this movie is an easy 10 out of 10 just for the opening credits alone i can't go into detail without spoilers but you've got to see it to believe it,1
3928,danny is beyond sorry br br he keeps making the same mistakes and is no longer interesting to watch at first i could feel for him as an addict myself my heart went out to him at the beginning and somewhere along the line he went over the line it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going and at the same time is seriously risking his life and the welfare of his family especially his children it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy i think he needs to watch this show maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage i can't understand how gretchen stays with him and i keep wondering how much is just for show and how much is love danny get a life a new one that is and don't get me started on dr gary what is with him and his face his skin looks like it's stretched to the max besides that looks don't mean a thing yet he seems not to be particularly impartial i think he too is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail sad very sad c'mon pull yourselves together,0
3929,by far one of the best sci fi films out there however it does take viewings to understand the concept of the film and to be able to appreciate not only the special effect but the main plot of the film itself it is my own feelings that this film film got such poor reviews because no one took the time to watch the film the way it was meant to be seen it does have some moments you wish would hurry up and pass by but they are few and far between hooper who directed tcm 1 and 2 along with a remake of invaders from mars and the funhouse does his best work here great score good acting and great effects makes this a film to add to your collection if you get the chance see the widescreen version on dvd highly recommended to any one who is a fan of sci fi,1
3930,this is the worst film i've seen in a long long time never mind the fact that so many useful things keep appearing on this island how convenient the acting is beyond poor from the outset its like one of those really badly scripted soft porn films on channel 5 a complete waste of time and i cant remember the lead actors name but i cant believe he still gets work i've never seen him act i've seen him in lots of films but i've never seen him act here are a few of the blaringly obvious errors apparently petrol lighters still work even when they've been soaked in sea water also according to this film you can walk into the sea naked but come out wearing bikini bottoms i'm guessing the camera man and editor were students there are plenty more errors but i'm ranting now besides its no so much the errors as the cast the script and the whole film avoid at all costs,0
3931,black rain is a superb film but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as 300 apiece i have the dvd and it's terrible very tiny non anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution killing size acceptable sound this is a primitive dvd that absolutely has to be rereleased br br btw i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them in the black sharp big picture simple but very good soundtrack buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding,1
3932,this movie is about people living at a later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out of work comedians mainly old males well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f ing but never there is any action just those people talking in the beginning i thought it's some cool perverted redneck stuff but after a while it got boring i mean how many versions can you think of saying f ing d k c t for sure this can be funny for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes but it was funny to watch those people trying to act i'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing but it does not disturb the movie it's cool like this because those individuals seem so poor f ed up crestfallen a that the style totally fits their wooden helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere i fell in love with the characters a little br br spoiler ahead later in the movie the f ers do some comedy shows rhymes about f ing with just themselves as audience and imagined applause then one gets an eviction advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs armed with some weapons then they got shoot fin sounds like action but it's not just some trashy home camera takes spoiler end br br but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and i'm pretty sure it's just what the movie maker wanted to have it's the portrait of those f k ups in an groggy home camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch but the texts about you know what the whole time get boring after a while br br pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenager stuff in popular movies tv series but now got in more horror movies which is more his cup of tea i guess and this his first direction effort will be distributed by troma now don't know anything about a release i got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only,0
3933,i laughed my ass off for an hour i had no idea who dan was why haven't i heard of dan finnerty before he's hysterical and so are his backup singers they make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience they blow these songs away this was on bravo last night why isn't this dan guy like ultra famous great voice charisma to burn he blew me away with this show i just read on the internet that he was once a member of stomp i guess there isn't anything he can't do i saw stomp at a ucla theater years ago and those guys were amazing this show last night was done by dreamworks does that mean that spielberg did this why don't they star this dan finnerty in a movie there was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera's cut to the audience everyone was so into it singing along or dancing the whole show had this amazing energy my only complaint was that it was not longer but looking back when you see how much energy these guys put out i guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour man i loved this show,1
3934,just reading why this show got canceled makes me rather steamed this was a favorite of mine as a kid and i always watched it when it came on no matter how many times i saw the episode sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either they did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's it did not really have any villains from the comics but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics powers were a bit different here too he had his spidey sense and he could climb walls but he was not nearly as strong as the spider man of the comics he was super strong though as i do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be the show was set in los angelos so there were not as man buildings to swing from but they did okay with the web it is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie i love the movies but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants spidey that has the mechanical web shooters this show had a good star as peter parker and he was okay as spider man it is nice to see a spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies neither this show nor the movie though has a spider man that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic still this show was fun without being as corny as the batman show,1
3935,lots of flames thousands of extras in battle scenes lots of beautiful sets i don't think the plot supported such a vast expenditure the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid psychologically if there weren't so much macho bombast in the production chinese movies tend to be this way in my experience and i think this detracts from the film,0
3936,this movie is one of my all time favorites i have watched it probably 100 times literally and it is still funny to me it seems that every time i watch it i see something different mel brooks is definitely the all time king of side splitting comedy,1
3937,while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie though through out the picture the plot changes if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot are by the book and unoriginal and with every one the movie kept getting worse br br candace cameron bure famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something trying to avenge the death i believe she is fine actress just not in the thriller range br br the filming was trashy and like i said the plot stale though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese i had no idea how much worse this film could get br br i highly do not recommend this movie unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for,0
3938,be very afraid of anyone who likes this film they probably inhaled too many paint chips as a child its so awful i refuse to relive a plot o yeah there wasn't one this movie is a true definition of what hollywood creates for people who don't want to think at a theatre do the bad guys win do the good guys win who cares,0
3939,the director of directed the first indian film i had seen dil se which led me down the path of buying well over hindi dvds in the br br course of four months i can say i understood the total attraction i was br br somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos it was an excellent movie i didn't know what to make of the dancing and the female br br vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears but somehow i found ar score hypnotic i bought the soundtrack the following day and then hota hai and k3g the following week and with the exception of ichi the br br killer a few other korean films i can't be bothered to watch much else kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong horror br br and action science fiction films for the past 30 years br br but i should get back to it is one of the mani latest efforts and i laughed cried got totally mad terrified and most of all i didn't feel manipulated the acting was superb the photography was beautiful i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting the music fit the movie perfectly and after the br br credits rolled i wanted to watch again so i did br br it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop this is what great film is all about i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over br br my wife is watching now and i can't wait for her reaction i can't expect it will be anything less than mine,1
3940,the ultimate gritty heist film elements of bogie welles sinatra will leave you sweating satisfied in comparison it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films such as oceans eleven remake reviewed in such high regard especially in europe films like rififi must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic noir is br br criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer,1
3941,when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it nothing to do not in the cinemas nor on dvd neither on blue ray absolutely nothing how it's possible this could really happen the direction is impeccable the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it's perfect and james franco is hot as hell br br please release this master piece and allow it to have it's proper life this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance br br,1
3942,it has taken me about a year now after seeing this film to write about it lord knows i have wanted to after witnessing it i knew i saw something i hadn't seen before but wasn't sure why now after reflecting for quite some time i know it's these characters that even now i still can't stop thinking about br br distant briefly and slowly tells the story of a relative who comes from the to live briefly with a well off to do photographer in the city in hopes to find employment however it becomes clear that after the idea of being a sailor and his employment prospects dim that he's really searching for something else some sort of purpose in his life br br through all this soul searching we are taken through seasonal surroundings that are filmed exquisitely the context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 particular ones when a girl has been following suddenly meets up with her significant other and the look of face as he looks into a basket of fish and the shot and light that reflects off his tortured face that scene in itself has to be one of the most gorgeously filmed pieces i have witness in i don't know how long br br in the end has his own demons too but ends up confronting his relative that he is not really trying to find a job and is forced to ask him to leave in a scene that is very simple but has the feeling of true heartbreak br br what the viewer is left with is lots of reflecting and pondering for these 2 people who everyone can see a piece of themselves in you should not be put off by the pace of this film it is truly worth every single breathtaking second br br rating 10 out of 10,1
3943,chips is an excellent blend of music light comedy and drama with a picture perfect performance by peter o' toole and and effortless romantic supporting performance by clark o' toole is able to show the shy uncommunicative teacher that wishes so much to be loved by his students and is only able to express his love when he married katherine clark she brings him the world what a lot of flowers and he is forever changed he becomes the beloved headmaster of through tragedy but knows he could only have achieved his goal through love the songs with the exception of the music hall number are all thought songs coming from character's emotions and thoughts and the more you listen to them the more beautiful they become walk through the world with me and you and i o'toole's finest moment is the final speech he gives to the students it was the reason for the oscar nomination as a teacher we question what book learning ever gets through but as chips says we did teach them how to behave with each other and that is what really counts beautifully filmed perfectly orchestrated by john williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you did i fill the world with love the boys sing their school song by the end chips realizes he was able to do it but only cause catherine was there,1
3944,the film is set in newcastle on tyne in north east england the town where i was born and grew up the film is also fundamentally dishonest the way it presents the town the kids but above all the men of the town in this film they are all stupid violent thieving thugs br br i suppose i could comment on the plot predictable the performances competently unattractive the direction lazy and unimaginative but to me that is all irrelevant compared to the director's insult to the town and its people br br thus the invitation in my summary to the director and writer mark herman to leave the north east,0
3945,ouch this is one ugly movie not only is it badly acted but it absolutely destroyed the book as well horrible how you could mess up such a classic book is beyond me but they sure did don't even think about even renting this,0
3946,i just watched this move for the 5th or 6th time and am still in love with it it still makes me cry and sing and worry and celebrate br br i almost wrote bonnie hunt a letter to tell her how much i love it david duchovny's grief scene is so flippin real minnie driver is so natural and honest my favorite line is when duchovny says i miss elizabeth but i ache for grace oh man i'm crying just thinking about it also bonnie hunt and jim belushi are the perfect chicago area couple i know them i swear i'm related to them i'm sure br br this movie is in my three times a year rotation i'd watch it once a week but i'm afraid i'd get too used to it i always want to make it a special day when i watch it,1
3947,when i first bought this movie i had my doubts about it even though the cast was pretty impressive but after seeing it i really do not regret spending the money in fact i'd love to spend it again and again and again on movies like this an absurd combination of humor drama thrill and the big questions this is exactly what makes it a great movie okay some might not enjoy what they see and some might even turn it off after a little while your loss it's got a wonderful way of dealing with the issues we've all been through in one way or the other and the characters you think you won't enjoy the company of throughout the movie turns out to be the ones you really come to love after a short while for anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living watch this movie i promise you you won't be disappointed,1
3948,when i first watch this series the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny and rory in particular were witty and intelligent albeit a bit too talkative after watching it for some time however my opinion changed br br the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self centered self obsessed who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence for example rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage while dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances these people are shallow see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules and if they don't they will hold grudges against them for an eternity they don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown up way they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned br br the series is character based so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch i still have the rest of the series but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion they must just as horrid as et al,0
3949,bears about as much resemblance to dean novel as jessica simpson does to a rocket scientist if you've read the book i suggest you put it as far out of your mind as possible before watching the movie br br watchers is your typical boy meets dog dog turns out to be super intelligent government lab experiment dog and boy are pursued by super intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by same lab and oh yeah did i mention the shady government agents pursuing the monster pursuing the dog movie br br corey haim is the boy barbara williams is his mother michael ironside is one of the evil government guys and sandy the dog is well the dog named here einstein in the book br br the monster effects are ridiculously cheesy much of the dialogue is laughable the script rarely makes sense or is believable a good example is haim's character's acceptance of the dog's intelligence as if every fido off the street can type messages on a computer keyboard or bark once for yes and twice for no hmm it's gotta be the puppy chow right haim's performance is enthusiastic but shaky as he carries off the stupid dialogue with the least amount of skill ironside has been the highlight of many a bad movie and this is no exception he easily gives the best performance of the movie although i'm compelled to add that the dog who's a pretty darn good actor himself comes in a close second br br all in all an atrociously dumb movie and yet and yet i watched it three times within a week and yet i can't help liking it hey what can i say i have a taste for junk and michael ironside not that i've ever actually tasted michael ironside i'm sure there are laws against that but any movie that can make me laugh that hard yes even unintentionally can't be all bad chalk it up to a guilty pleasure a yes i know it's insultingly stupid but i like it anyway movie br br it's tough for me to rate this on a normal scale i'm forced to give it a d but on my own personal cheese scale it gets bumped up to an a br br yeah i know i'm weird like that,1
3950,i don't understand why some of you or many have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10 do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason sure this may be a zombie flick with some splatter but thats it i'm not a hater on zombie films but this was awful really actually i should call it more like a zombie soap because thats how the acting is production is well okay barely an attempt at plot development awful acting silly effects clichés and an abrupt ending go ahead and like zombie movies but don't ever give this above a 5 0 honestly though the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh seriously,0
3951,the entire series not just the blue planet is nothing short of amazing the best nature series we have ever seen the episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space we have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away we read a negative comment on this and could not believe it there is so much new information that we never learned in school its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our earth's eco system the amount of time and effort put into capturing these shots is very much apparent when you sit down and watch this series br br a must see for everyone,1
3952,i love this movie one of my all time favorites this was the first big screen movie my mom took me to see when i was 9 i highly recommend it to every african american this story is about love trust challenges and everyday life of a black family all the actors worked well together i wish it was on video but as of yet it is not available that i know of i caught it on television a few years ago and recorded it so whenever i get the urge to watch it i have it the soundtrack is awesome too a must see,1
3953,how can this movie be described oh yeah i've got it wretched br br i'm not big on chop socky but this is just plain garbage anyone who would waste their money to pay to see it is just too sad for words,0
3954,my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of in the french 60's so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvre br br the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the of le louvre but the adaptation is ridiculous the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious american business without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine br br acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect low budget br br what is left of all that not much outside a few good shots of paris which is seldom a disappointment br br was worth more than that br br,0
3955,this movie really proves that the world is all too often an unfair place especially the world of motion pictures the assignment received barely any attention upon it's release and not surprisingly flopped at the box office but when history will be written this movie will most surely receive some long lost praise br br thank god i'm surrounded by friends who knows what's good for me being a movie buff like myself a pal highly recommended the assignment a movie i hadn't even heard about i decided to check out what leonard maltin gave it and not surprisingly he gave it 1 2 knowing that this is the same grade he gave classics like alien the usual suspects and the matrix i kid you not i knew his meaning didn't mean squat jack s so without hesitating i went out and bought it on dvd this was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my proudest belongings in my dvd collection despite a cover design that echoes a low budget stinker with casper van dien br br the assignment is expertly directed delivering some really intense moments that will hold you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie on top of that it boasts an at times brilliant story that you know will be riddled with unexpected twists and turns it stars aidan quinn in one of his best performances and serves him with great support by donald sutherland and ben kingsley who are both in great form br br something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie most of them can't seem to praise it enough so what are you waiting for if you call yourself a fan of action thrillers you should have bought it rented it seen it yesterday,1
3956,grande is not an artful exploration of mixed sexuality but if you're in need of it a movie for an x rated channel although i suspect there's nothing in this movie to spoil for a willing viewer the plot is simply an excuse for male to female and male to male couplings set in the unconvincing context of a competition between a parisian school for future ceos and a major school for those seeking higher degrees in the liberal arts there's likewise a frisson of cultural clash between high status and lower status french youth plus a societal conflict involving native frenchmen and arab immigrants from north africa all that's missing is a female to female coupling which could easily have been arranged with no more than a slight twist in the plot br br the acting is at a somewhat higher level than in the usual pornographic movie but grande is to be blunt about it no more than pornography with artistic aspirations i'm not offended by the sex it's just repetitive and before long boring where's the hays office when you really need it,0
3957,the other lowest rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children who insist on watching the sunday omnibus my god it's depressing like all soaps it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot on if anyone lived in a social environment like this they'd slash their wrists within days and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more than you'll ever see here take my advice avoid this nadir of the british tv industry it is evil,0
3958,this movie was sooo bad it wasn't even funny at all not even the sarcastic scenes were funny oh man bad so bad thumbs down spoofed karate kid teen wolf footloose dirty dancing some kind of wonderful soul man and probably another or two chris kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse he has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who chris has eyes for i thought the acting was really bad i like laugh out loud comedies this was not one not another teen movie wasn't funny but had a lot more funny scenes than totally awesome scary movie is funny i always laugh when i watch those super enjoyable this movie not funny,0
3959,2005 will go down in 'dr who' history as its most incredible year everything seemed to click a first rate new doctor and companion big audiences 10 million for the first episode and christmas special major awards critical acclaim and those idiots who spent years giggling at the seeming inability to negotiate stairs were well and truly silenced but then christopher eccleston dropped a bombshell quitting after just one series it looked like the honeymoon was over luckily the public appears to have embraced his successor the excellent david tennant on top of this the show boasts fine s f x like the spaceship crashing into 'big ben' in of london' and superb story lines such as 'tooth of ghosts the new 'dr who' is basically the same as the old only updated for the 21st century some fans have accused russell t davies of 'ruining' the show they need to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he came along,1
3960,manna from heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation the result is that the movie goer finds himself herself sitting with this silly grin on his her face peace in his her heart and high expectations for human kind watching this movie was a most pleasant experience i would venture to say uplifting experience but some would say that sounds corny,1
3961,this movie scared the hell out of me for no good reason the eerie music was well written but other than that its a complete waste of time and it really disturbed me i'm not really sure why either if you just want to see a bad 'b' horror movie i guess you could give it a shot but only as a last resort,0
3962,i was going to use 'the german scream' as a summary but that was already taken lol it sums up anatomy nicely provided you're not alien to reading subtitles anatomy fits in snugly with the scream urban legend pack it's a teen horror set in a medical school where the students are going missing then turning up as experiment subjects in the dissection lab cue one plucky student investigating herself and uncovering a giant conspiracy br br provided you're watching the original german language film i can't comment on the dub having not seen the english edition anatomy is sharply written and cleverly plotted so that the tension never really lets up in comparison to it's american counterparts the mystery is uncovered much faster meaning that instead of being a slasher right up until the final reveal anatomy evolves during it's running time from a slasher come body horror movie into a smart and exciting thriller it's a gripping ride from start to finish br br hats off to the actors involved as well franka potente proves once more that she's an intelligent smart actress who can make any role come to life her central performance as paula is a great foundation for the movie to build from the spooky and their teachers pets are equally good a truly foreboding presence at all times br br it's also astounding that the movie doesn't drag much the pace is fast and punchy very similar to the earlier urban legend meaning that there's always something going on to keep your attention high if there's one downside it could be that some will find anatomy too gruesome for them but if you persevere through the first half's admittedly graphic dissection sequences the latter half with it's exciting thriller overtones will reward you i recommend anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teen horror but is a bit jaded with the american take on the matter,1
3963,today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held wow i don't know where to start he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on and the scenes between seagal and where they seem to improv are embarrassing and what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan and even then you are better off with his earlier work of the 4 films in my marathon submerged into the sun foreigner and today you die today was the worst a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious,0
3964,if you like poor se some bad acting and a total lack of credibility this is a movie for you so a really cheap looking movie but i liked it anyway why because i like those kind of movies i can't help but smile when i see these kind of movies what were the producers actors director and se people thinking when they made this film don't expect an abyss or alien just a very low budget horror adventure movie br br there is one nice splatter moment when a guy's head is shot off but for the most the horror is pretty tame the final monster is pretty cool too br br it's only 73 minutes long so you can t go wrong there maybe you can pick it up at your local videostore or watch it on tv i'm sure you will have a good time watching it br br but don't say you weren't warned,0
3965,this movie is so mild i tried not to expect anything greater from this film but still it was a big disappointment the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential this could have been so much better the characters are really simple no depth at all it's a shame that previously talented performers and didn't make the already poor characters any better the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr p br br and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie that's hideous br br why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation br br it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it oh no,0
3966,horrible acting with the worst special f x i've ever bore witness too it's bad enough i wasted 3 to watch this crummy pile of crap but it's the hour and a half time i lost that i could've been doing anything else like getting a root canal or volunteering for jury duty getting drunk couldn't even help this video br br to put it bluntly i sincerely believe i actually lost a few iq points during the course of watching this idiotic piece of mind numbing work perhaps i should have followed my own advice this time never expect a decent film if it's written directed and produced by the same person and never ever expect anything of value from jeff fahey,0
3967,i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci fi movie but this was almost intolerable while a few of the special effects are very cool landscapes this is no rather a disjointed weird mother daughter relationship with sci fi concepts thrown in the acting wooden framing and shooting kindergarten film school and with hand to hand combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie this film bores the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along narrator unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea save your love of sci fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here,0
3968,i was surprised to read the comments of the person who so disliked this film it really is quite funny there are definitely a few laugh out lines that my boyfriend and i quote to each other some of the situations might be unsettling bisexuality drugs a particularly strange child's view of sexuality but believable at the same time it's about communication and miscommunication between men and women,1
3969,i don't think i've yet seen a movie in my whole lifetime about a high school kid creating his own college just to impress his parents nowadays movies are either remakes or sequels or plots that have been used in many different films this one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy films only lightens the deal with this well thought out story and with laughs mixed in this is a good movie now i've seen better but upon going into the theater i was thinking another drug beer frat party with some sexual innuendo tossed in aka an american pie flick but i was surprised to sum it up i enjoyed the film and the next time your shuffling through the paper for movies look for show times to accepted if you want to laugh out loud that is,1
3970,i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway boy was i right br br also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times in terms of video quality it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder it looks so bad i really did not like the plot and after watching the movie i was very let down i will not tell any spoilers but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed it has been done so many times before br br the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler's english paper if i had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie i've ever seen this one may just be it i can't believe they actually released this film it really isn't worth the rent or a penny of anyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the movie's expense,0
3971,most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel br br i was impressed by the amount of suspense there was i had actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore it wasn't but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths br br the thing that i disliked however was all of the plot complications those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through but what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically why were they protected from michael's damage until a certain point what exactly were they going to do with the baby how did jaime lloyd get pregnant for that matter why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too why did michael kill all his co conspirators in the end why were there fetuses in the lab the actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses but it was never explained to the audience br br if you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then this'll be okay for you however if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else,0
3972,i woke up and it was a beautiful day the sun was shining the birds were singing and i fancied getting a movie something new a horror movie perhaps like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of in a gold wrapper the front cover is great and the comment on the back is mesmerising 'it will scare the crop out of you' oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance br br one of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these 'actors' i think no i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these 'scarecrows' who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes i used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night but having seen this movie i nearly wet myself through laughing so much just at the sight br br i have seen scarier quite honestly not mine though i'm a dab hand at cooking and if anyone associates this movie with my let's just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row br br if anyone has any good corn crop not pop movies they can recommend feel free to inform me it's a great comedy if nothing else ok it is nothing else enjoy but a little advice before pressing the play button on your dvd player throw it out of the window,0
3973,although the plot of cover girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the kern and gershwin musical numbers following her signature role in gilda hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well gene kelly who was on loan to columbia from mgm matches her in dancing and the sequence where he with his own shadow was nicely done the supporting characters were also competently acted personally i didn't enjoy cover girl as much as the musicals hayworth made with fred astaire however cover girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend my score 7 10,1
3974,six shooter tunnel sergeant dr death pinhead cyclops and blade help the young andre toulon take out egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen br br retro puppet master is atmospheric with many sets quality acting and some fun puppet fx what it lacks in gore it makes up for with an interesting well paced plot br br best quote dr death don't you know my friends smell the sulfur see the smoke br br this is easily the best dave decoteau film i've seen the actors do a more than credible job jack donner as turns in an inspired performance and the young toulon does well with the puppets oh and the ring needle is cool br br john score is a nice symphonic take on the original puppet master tunes by richard band keeping the movie playful and eerie it's rare for a full moon score to actually add something to a film and this one does br br unfortunately dave allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for band and co in the late 90's and beyond so all of the puppet action is done rod and string there's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where looking for his pinhead and of course as with all of the full moon fare of this time period rpm was shot in and around castel studios in bucharest so most of the bit parts were cast to romanians hearing their parisian accents was a bit annoying br br all in all this is probably one of the top 10 full moon films it's certainly the most inventive of the puppet master sequels,1
3975,the frogs who wanted a king or frogland is ladislaw starewicz's most cautionary tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god jupiter for their answers jupiter responds first by sending a tree stump and then a stork neither works out and the stork is especially dangerous to the creatures the frogs have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the stork arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the rhino vhs that had bambi meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here,1
3976,there is a point in the film where the female boss of the death machines a multi ethnic trio to please everyone being inclusive i think it's called these days talks about using leverage on a business man except such is her delivery that it sounds like at which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness but it didn't the boss lady had to do the talking as the death machines did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does interminably there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot staggers from one cliché to another the three mute death machines live to survive another day at the end of the film hopefully there wasn't a sequel,0
3977,ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie i have lived here my whole life i have waited for this movie to come out and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me it was worth it br br the movie is different from the book but in my eyes it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book in both i cried there were moments that tore me up i laughed and i smiled just as much it's a great movie with a great story line br br it's about never giving up on finding that one the one that will change you forever the one that will shape your soul and awaken you to a whole new view of life br br i have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever which is what gere's character did to lane's i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i him again a year later for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what i'm talking about it's never too late to find your true love great work ms lane and mr gere,1
3978,the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available this show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap i tried to support this show in its decline because i like human interest stories and primetime used to have some very good ones unfortunately april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the rug instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly i was truly sickened i hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future if it does i will be happy these days all you can expect from diane sawyer and the good folks from primetime live are butt kissing sessions with a list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars don't waste the hour of your life you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at nite,0
3979,this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was acquainted with many of the actors in minor rolls most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was it was interesting however to see it being made most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist such as the nightclub the pizza shop etc the world premiere was held at the civic theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me watch this movie with a word of advice enjoy it for what it is a very low budget poorly made karate flick,0
3980,i remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when i was maybe 5 years old if that and to this day i can remember this movie in just bits and pieces it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was sooo scared i think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark the main part that was the most freaky to me was elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside at the time i thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way hazy so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking and that part is what freaked me out the most i really wish i could see this movie again if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at yahoo com,1
3981,hardware wars rips off everything in star wars but if you are planning on doing any parody you need to do it just a bit better than this not that there is anything wrong per se with hardware wars but if you spoof do it well or not at all,0
3982,the dog can act unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux children's film can a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two children much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold hearted father in what can only be described as dickensian the evil widower forbids his children who may or may not be mentally challenged from playing with benji neither the children nor benji obeys soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them it's only then that the old man realizes that benji is good not bad br br tom lester whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers so does the regrettably over utilized deborah previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful it's a bikini world she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good girl reputation by playing it bad br br stay away from benji he's a dog and this movie is a dog,0
3983,george hilton never really grabs me like franco nero or clint eastwood but this is a great outing for him basically off the django man with no name and doing a damn good job the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch fans of the genre will be in heaven,1
3984,this movie lacks in everything except bobby deol who in his own standards is mediocre no one in this movie has come close to act in a single scene is complete fake in her acting br br the great anupam kher has a guest appearance and is better in those 2 minutes than bobby in the whole movie the music does'nt compliment the movie br br that well the contrast in music between bobby and is not highlighted that well great concept gone completely wrong the movie does'nt have a proper ending please don't waste your time as i did on this movie,0
3985,i watched this movie because of costas mandylor and lauren holly i adored them together on picket fences so it was a treat to see them together again this was not the best movie ever made but it was cute very predictable but sometimes mindlessly fun movies are just what i need br br the desserts were gorgeous and i wanted to eat all of them i did love it when that one fell apart though i bet it still tasted good br br costas and lauren still had the great chemistry that they had back on picket fences and i swooned as they kissed in this movie br br i wouldn't watch this again but it was a great filler for one night,1
3986,who should watch this film anyone who has ever taken acid read philip k dick thought the premise of the matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with i laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spot on this film is great this film is cool it is better than the matrix by a long shot i didn't fall asleep in for a kick off action special effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the matrix is is gross it is disturbing and it is funny david cronenberg has done some shonky stuff rabid and some works of genius too videodrome is another one worth checking out as is stephen king adaptation the dead zone but this is one of my all time favourites i can't remember the ending which is a good thing cos it means i can watch it again or perhaps i never watched this film at all maybe it's an implanted memory or maybe it 'really' happened to me i don't know at any rate it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality and i'm glad,1
3987,in new york a group of freshmen join the high school for the performing arts after being well succeeded in their audition for four years their dreams deceptions success love and personal dramas are disclosed though the insecure doris maureen the homosexual montgomery the aggressive leroy gene anthony ray the hopeful coco irene cara the ambitious ralph barry miller and their friends until their graduation day br br twenty eight years ago fame was a great success with the story of teenagers seeking a spot in the show business and i loved this movie and the soundtrack on cd i have just watched fame on dvd and presently i would say that it is a good movie with a great potential only but with too many flawed subplots the story follows too many characters and leaves many situations without answer i do not know whether alan parker had edition problems to reduce the running time of this movie but what happened for example with the ballerina that goes to a clinic for abortion what happened with leroy and his teacher did he fail due to his grammar problem what happened with coco after undressing her blouse in the apartment of that crook the musician that plays synthesizer and his proud father are left behind in the subplot anyway fame is still a delightful entertainment and a cult movie for me my vote is seven br br title brazil fame,1
3988,this show disturbs me it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez even full house and roseanne they're all better than home improvement first off the mother jill annoys me so much she is an whiny baby and i really despise her brad is a fat toad and he is annoying too and the youngest brother i don't even know his name i don't notice him at all that's probably not the actor's fault though it's probably the writers' tim is just a stupid ass although jill is definitely my least favorite i don't like any of them the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy as the middle child he is still a pesky little brother but an older brother and i like his fun character the other star goes to al as the chubby friend his character is likable other than randy and al this show sucks,0
3989,even mst3k couldn't make this painful long and ultimately mind bending drek funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense br br the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlights br br the hero of the film ator is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of a film dressed in a loin cloth and sporting pecs like melons as joel put it he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here br br i would recommend this only to die hard and i mean die hard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this i commend you you should be able to make it through anything,0
3990,i saw this movie yesterday and like most wrote i also expected a steven movie god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous in had a little doubts cause i read that ja rule was playing in it but i thought hopefully they give him a role so i don't get irritations by watching him and offcourse the opposite happend steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a crew like this steven was broke and needed cash bah what a big dissapointment if you like steven movie pleaseee skip this one its pure drama you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3 10 but the acting of ja rule screws up the whole movie for his buddy kurupt with his irritating hood talk br br my beer went from tasting fresh to water we do the dishes in the story didn't had any good about it to me it felt like a 3 year old produced it br br hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie people this isn't even worth renting as that br br to bad and pitty,0
3991,the elite sniper team that has inserted or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them selves invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes when the hero runs to rescue his wife he actually jogs when inside a building and aiming for a target only some 20 30 meter away the hero uses his scope besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldn't be able to focus that close there is a satellite that can actually look into buildings br br the list is endless and the film is the biggest heap of crap i have ever put in my dvd player,0
3992,before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the lambs director jonathan demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention it has a fine concept is well paced has great performances a complicated romance but it just simply isn't very funny pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city after her husband baldwin is murdered the crime boss who killed him stockwell takes a fancy to pfeiffer his wife is furious and to complicate matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her all of this should have been a laugh a minute pfeiffer sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow as is the hyperactive ruehl and modine is good too as the nice cop but the script is simply devoid of one liners wit humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands the result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws it oozes charm but is tediously short on humour,0
3993,i'm not really a t v watcher except between the ages of 6 and 8 and general hospital still had luke and laura but there are a few exceptions and i definitely think that king of queens is one of them every decade has it's classics and i think that this show will or damn well should be amongst this decade's best its comedic timing is awesome and can at times be down right odd on a more note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle and not so subtle complexities in their characters without getting too hokey one commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and i agree it's definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you're in you're pretty much hooked and with good reason,1
3994,i really wish i had read everyone's review before going to see the movie it was one of the most excruciating films that i've ever seen i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie i should have followed my instinct the movie offered nothing new or clever it was boring and very cliché i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman the characters did not represent any women that i know they were boring bitter and melodramatic the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money and the actors looked tired poor make up and hair styling it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie it was not even half as good my suggestion do not see this movie,0
3995,the prior comments are way to generous this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic on the other hand i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as beyond belief no words can express how i feel about this this movie will move you as expected the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements they were wrong the sadistic pleasure i had foisting this on people was well worth the 5 i paid for the movie on the other hand one former friend says i owe him 90 minutes of his life back i particularly enjoyed the gun's eye view of parts of the movie truly awesome in it's absurdity,0
3996,as a czech i am very pleased when i read these comments here i am absolutely sure that this film is great and what you maybe don't know is that story was specially written for mr the man you can see is him and his typical attitude to live and to resist death he was one of great actors and we are very lucky that we he has made so many beautiful films during his life you are lucky you could see at least one of them enjoy,1
3997,lady and the tramp ii is very animated and the songs especially that of the junkyard dogs are quite good however the family seems even too idyllic and i can't help understanding that scamp is discontented when everything is forbidden however i also pity angel who never has had a loving family until she meets jim dear and darling br br in any case it's clear that the original lady and the tramp is better than this sequel,1
3998,poor casper van dien his career has slid a long way from tarzan and starship troopers br br in meltdown he's a policeman who just happens to be dating tv reporter stefanie von and her brother is a scientist who's trying to deal with a speeding comment headed for earth but in the runaway comet business even a near miss causes some real problems as the earth's orbit goes out of kilter br br from the survival of the earth we go to the survival of van dien and his immediate family his daughter's gangbanger boyfriend ryan mcdonell actually proves to be of some use especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a crooked cop might mean the van dien group a lot of harm br br my only question here is why didn't they have bruce willis billy bob thornton and the rest of that crew to deal with the nasty comet br br pass this one up folks,0
3999,i found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch and i'm surprised it's rated so lowly actually i can see why it is i imagine it's the fans of eric roberts and alyssa milano that have been giving most of the 1s and 2s because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie and alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half and in those she says little and wears less although never nude if that's what you're looking for stick with embrace of the vampire although they're always a pleasure it's a pity she or eric don't get much screen time yet i still give this an 8 br br,1
4000,i wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away if you are going to investigate loch ness do it for real enough of the bull same with horror and sci fi if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary make it scary not funny i hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life or running or whatever their life is at stake and they are cracking jokes this never happens cmon where have all the good directors gone i think horror and sci fi have really gone down the tube since the 70's i long for the days that a horror flick was scary all this scary movie crap is for the birds this film is also for the birds if you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk don't expect it in this video,0
4001,house calls is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as how they used to make them it stars walter matthau in one of his best roles as a recently widowed doctor who goes out on the dating scene again and hits paydirt as he seems to have a different woman every night he then meets hospital patient glenda jackson and soon develops a relationship with her but it's one that will be severely tested as she informs him she is a one man woman and expects him to be a one woman man br br this is a sweet very funny film also starring art carney as the senile hospital administrator and richard benjamin as matthau's friend and fellow doctor it's a must see for any matthau fan or any fan of light comedy br br you won't be disappointed,1
4002,when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common however reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about i will be honest i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree however there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party in this case it is in fact a mausoleum the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too still it was just not the movie i was expecting,0
4003,also known as the tormented or the or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show is a forgotten exorcist rip off which contains one of the best horror moments i've ever seen the scene is when the crucifix comes alive this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective great fxs it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene br br this is one of the most frustrating movies ever imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it they actually succeed in creating something truly original a possessed sculpture of crucified man which is shocking when you think about it but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip off had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept with the characters trying to destroy it etc this film would have rocked but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture she never tells anyone from where the demon came from she and the script completely forgets the haunted crucifix which is stupid br br if you like so called euro cult movies the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other euro cult movies but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets the remaining 45 minutes suck boring it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate badly the exorcist so watch the first 45 minutes of and enjoy the 1970s fashions the sleaze and the amazing statue comes alive to ravish the girl scene but after the first 45 minutes press stop and eject and might as well go clip your toenails,1
4004,as i have said before i am not a fan of tweety he's just so aggravating i wish sylvester would just eat him and get it over with br br in this cartoon sly is homeless once again and is back to feeding out of garbage cans he spots a cruise ship leaving port nearby and decides to hop aboard when he tweety is one of the passengers br br the ship provides an adequate stage for the following hijinks and sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness if only for once he's succeed by chewing and swallowing thus finishing of the irritating canary forever but as cartoons starring tweety go this one is quite good but it's all thanks to that brilliant cat,1
4005,i have seen this movie twice and it's theme is an invigorating one i have been into computers for many years now and this movie inspired me in a technologically sense as does a fresh love which stoked the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of infatuation very original idea great allurement in the way it holds you as it tells it's story to minds that need a release from the every day realities of this life,1
4006,with all due respect to joel and rosemary and their characters department s will be forever associated with peter jason king br br most people remember him as this camp flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of austin powers but that will do a disservice to the character he's far more nuanced than that br br jason king is lazy he often lets stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end he is egotistical his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever annabelle is right and she often is he's clearly a man having a mid life crisis and drink drives but jason king is brilliant if wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero it wouldn't have worked but he shows king often as a paper tiger led by his libido love of finery and prone to and it gets in the way of his detective work at times but he has some of the best lines and put downs in tv history and by not playing him as whiter than white the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it br br watching it again on dvd recently you get to see just how much depth wyngarde put into jason king,1
4007,kim basinger and mickey rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship while the acting by rourke and basinger is ok the flim doesn't allow their characters to truly form allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them basinger's character considering suicide that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer as is it is a glossy well produced with mtv style editing piece of soft core voyeurism 4 of 10,0
4008,it's 2005 my friends a time of amazing special effects and an age of technology so why can't we see a movie that's a little more thought out than this cheesy low budget film i've seen a lot of low budget movies that rock my socks off but this one it's almost as if it's trying to be horrible just don't watch it i can look past lack of special effects and computer generated scenes if the acting itself was at least good i feel like a small child produced this entire movie there's not even an original plot line vampire assassins in itself is one big plot hole with an attempt to mock itself can someone tell me if perhaps this was designed as a comedy movie and i just didn't know it it makes me wonder what does the sequel have in store for us who so loved the first installment,0
4009,if not the best movie ever made babette's feast is certainly among the most loving this is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of artistry generosity loyalty and grace humor is mixed with tender longing characters are treated with searching honesty but also deep respect there are meditations here on memory fate old age and faithfulness marvellous camera work by cinematographer seldom have wrinkled faces looked so luminous in the candle light the meal is accompanied by delicious period music mozart and simple folk hymns enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit for as the general says mercy and truth have met together and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another,1
4010,just what the world needed another superficial cookie cutter mary kate and ashley olsen movie this movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere complete with stereotypical junior high experience they make learning anything at all seem completely taboo i can't stand the fake french accents or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually fall for the twins why am i putting everything in parenthesis because its all stereotyped the twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather they should be happy they even have a grandfather at all how does this fit the mary kate ashley mold this one has them fixing up a single guy who gasp isn't their father yes folks they actually have a mother who appears for all of five seconds i haven't even sat through thirty minutes of this and i can already tell how it will end up this movie is so pitiful it makes miss usa seem like an academic bowl really,0
4011,harrison ford playing a playing a cop in a crime thriller the perfect ingredients it seems for top entertainment with harrison back to his indy and han solo best protecting a witness from ruthless and merciless murderers how easy it is to be fooled if the film concentrated on the main supposed themes of crime and suspense instead of putting up and shoving ice creams in peoples faces it possibly could have been more worthwhile unbelieveably predictable with the best method of of a foe is with corn,0
4012,watch this movie it's truly a good ride through the difficulties of making a indie movie and what happens when it blows up in the film maker's face there's a lot of stuff about punk rock and the philosophy behind that movement and it's relationship to this project so if you're into old punk american punk you'll dig it but beware there's a ton of bad acting bits from the failed project that are incorporated yet they do come off funny at times and actually some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in movie making pontificate and what they went through in the three year period that it took to put this together so anyone out there that's about to make a film especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field you should watch this and learn from the film maker's mistakes,1
4013,well anne is way way too old wentworth looks younger than she and he should not louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty she is supposed to be average not pretty when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer lady russell is too old this is crazy if you read the novel she is anne's older more mature friend maybe as old as mother would be which would be around 18 20 years older than anne so around 50 not 70 its crazy doesn't fit how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning she smiles when she says oh the worst is over i've seen him now the worst has passed yeah right ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two that one is right on this one is way off read the novel and you'll know what i mean,0
4014,i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team br br the plot is all too simple and is mainly based on one joke how strange kilts and scotsmen are and that's all okay there are some other jokes but i didn't find them very funny at all they are outdated and i guess were not very entertaining when the movie was first released br br still the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history and they make the best out of the awkward story which i expect was filmed without a proper script and the scenery is nice to look at br br in my opinion watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans other people should stay away from it,0
4015,this bbc version of an agatha christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely christie's books tend to move at a gentle sometimes even sedate pace and evans is one that certainly does it also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot this version is extremely faithful to the book which results in a very slow involved story as a christie fan i gave it 7 stars but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action free story i appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the bbc did for its later christie productions much more br br in the end this movie is a leisurely pleasure highlighted by the breathy waif francesca annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off james warwick very well,1
4016,simply miserable lana turner vehicle had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of the student prince with adults is no leading man either he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing br br the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king had better return to his people as far as i'm concerned the faster the better is that lana turner really singing with not bad if it is her the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie the prince and the showgirl with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier,0
4017,what impressed me the most about one true thing was how up front it was when the daughter mentions her mother's cancer at the beginning of the movie as depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a character's fatal illness 2 3 into the movie love story terms of endearment etc br br meryl streep renee zellweger and william hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge the characters they play seem human they're not perfect people arguably one might not say that about the martha stewart type character streep plays but throughout the film i found her character to be noble in a non sappy way she's dealing with her plight the best way she knows how br br one true thing is an observant unsentimental family drama in which the tears at the end were well earned,1
4018,so this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment after the paperwork is done the psychiatrist says i'm going to show you ink blots tell me what you see in them well says the patient looking at the first one i see a man and a woman having sex on seeing the second one he says i see two women having sex on seeing the third he says i see two men having sex on seeing the next one he says i see two men and two women having sex the psychiatrist puts down the the so he says we'll start by discussing your my says the guy and you with all these dirty pictures that's how this movie strikes me,0
4019,i thought this movie was fun i have never really watched old movies before and this one was a really great first date film it had warmth and heart and spirit was kind of cheesy but in today's film industry cheesy is cute i gave it a ten and i highly suggest renting buying or seeing the movie anyway you can gene kelly was very dreamy and a little bit sarcastic and you knew the character thought that he was gonna have it all the female lead was cast perfect because their two personalities had spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen the grandma in the movie was priceless the perfect addition to a great old movie i love the fact it was black and white and gene kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help liking him see it,1
4020,this was a very good 1950s western one of the better ones i've seen in a decade which featured that genre on screen and on tv it certainly had three big actors on the marquee glenn ford barbara stanwyck and edward g robinson it turns out that ford was the star of this film while the other two stars were in supporting roles ford had the bulk of the dialog he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson she played the real heavy in this film and the character she played was a little too contradictory at times br br ford handled his starring status very ably as he usually did especially in westerns he played a nice guy who didn't want to fight was a peaceful man but if you pushed him look out br br the story had a nice mixture of action and lulls not overdoing either it had an expansive western setting which was put to good use with the widescreen it also featured realistic people in a realistic setting that credibility with the characters especially the supporting players was most impressive the men way out shined the women in this film acting and character wise dianne foster and may wynn were weak the only negatives of the production it's easy to see why these two actresses never became stars br br even though it is over 50 years old this western is one you'd still find fast enough moving to enjoy no matter how old you are or what you're used to seeing for classic film fans this is almost a must with this cast and good story highly recommended,1
4021,what can i say about this movie it really is one of the worst gay themed movies ever to come out of the uk i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and georgina hale needed the money what story there is is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly it's supposed to be based on real life events well all i can say to that one is that it's an insult to the real life characters the dvd is out at the moment in the uk it's available in either the split screen format which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch gay cinema can be so much better than this and we deserve more,0
4022,i have seen a number of horror movies to know that this one was one of kind full moon pictures has a knack of giving this fan an entertaining night for all the cheesiness of most vampire films this is the one that has not only a good premise but has two good sequels a must see,1
4023,this movie is simply excellent for some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in india in new york however i have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie this is definitely the funniest movie to come out of india everyone gives a good performance amir khan however just takes over and puts the movie over the top,1
4024,the plot of open graves is very simple it's about a board game called where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense i liked eliza dushku in wrong turn but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here the climax with cgi witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid the only reason to see open graves are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up give me any 70's or 80's low budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap a generous 3 out of 10,0
4025,yes it feels and for the most part plays like an after school special for a slightly more adult audience alright maybe a teen audience but add in bill murray already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent a nice supporting cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days at summer camp and you get a heartwarming funny sleeper hit br br it does get a little too smarmy for its own good but that is also one of its charms when you hear the title meatballs and see the poster you expect a teenage sex romp but what you get is a yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp the and the of simpler times reminds me of a christmas story which i also love the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated the only movie i've seen that comes close is indian summer which i like almost as much as meatballs and also stars matt craven let's hope he completes the trilogy maybe he could come back for return of the meatballs and bring some dignity back to the franchise meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic br br meatballs is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time not really guilty either it's a wonderful little film that always makes me smile,1
4026,a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused obviously the original title of joe would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience i have personally experienced the condition of often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender and it is indeed a lot like the movie skeleton man a dry scummy film that provokes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower br br it is unfortunate that the choice of skeleton man for the title was by the distributor probably the work of some meddling hollywood no nothing studio exec who just didn't get it and not joe those of us who have seen the film know that the skeleton man is actually joe a skeletal manish apparition not a true skeleton man the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable and for that alone i cannot give this film a high rating imagine this when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive skeleton man movie and need a title they will be totally screwed and we are all as serious fans of the genre diminished for that br br joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman black claw mansquito humongous nature boy billy morty the wooden doll the the moon beast bloody bill the driller killer mickey rooney and so forth but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding caped tackle dummy skull face tied to the side of a horse skeleton man wannabe br br that's too bad,0
4027,i'm a collector of films starring ms weaver so i bought this only because of her being in it i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs these bombs include this movie deal of the century one woman or two and half moon street she also appeared in the year of living dangerously which was not a bomb but her performance was less than notable in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel aliens the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters before the release of aliens i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out luckily she wasn't br br back to eyewitness though the film is boring it doesn't create any suspense william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in and the atmosphere is just to dry sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering br br watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl,0
4028,head is a film that has held up well since its original release date in 1968 the movie is a complete contradiction of the monkees image it presents the monkees in a way their fans never perceived them men with real thoughts totally controlled by their producers the monkees were given the opportunity to tell their side of the story the film pokes fun at their image the entertainment industry and corporate america the soundtrack contains some of their best music it's a movie well worth seeing over and over again,1
4029,for all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film like why does he show spaceships docking for like 15 minutes here's a word you might want to think about br br beauty br br beauty is an under rated concept sure you'll often see nice photography and so on in films but when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it there is a weird belief among that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed this is depressing hogwash there is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot a director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so br br requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films it requires you to relax it requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization don't get me wrong plots and characters are good but they're not the be all and end all of everything there are different kinds of film and to enjoy you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty pure beauty unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films br br all art is quite useless oscar wilde,1
4030,i bought this film from my local blockbuster for 99p an it's been sitting in my video bookcase for at least a year now then tonight i decided to see it the film was quite different to what i had expected and i didn't find any humour in it all i saw was that it was a bleak look at people dealing with love relationships and sexual orientation and i didn't really see the psycho killer plot really having a point except to add tension to the end of the film i felt that the person playing the lesbian woman did a great job i was following her emotions and what happened around her some people would probably have seen some of the stuff that she does as funny but i could really put myself in her place loving someone but them rejecting you at every turn no matter how hard you try i thought it was a very moving film and dealt with all the different sexualities well i was expecting something like bound gagged a love story but this is a very different film not for bigots,1
4031,william h macy always gives a good performance he never looks lazy and never seems like he'd rather be somewhere else in short he's what more actors should be like a slight case of murder is directed by steven who went on to do two more great films with macy door to door the wool cap br br television movies have long been a dump of overdone acting poor cinematography and sub par scripting that's why it's so refreshing to see a tv movie that does exactly what it's sort of film was created for to tell a small story not a simplistic story that does not require viewing on the big screen br br a slight case of murder is light entertaining fare and an great watch br br 7 6 out of 10,1
4032,if you are like me and observed the original benji phenomenon from afar finally seeing the movie for the first time 30 years later you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974 br br my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog a feature on the last couple seasons of petticoat junction never a great show the dog less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time br br benji is an 86 minute mega dose of the dog following him on several daily circuits through the town of mckinney texas if this sounds boring you would be advised to give benji a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a benji fan if there are still any out there br br unlike my dog skip monkey business or because of dixie the human actors in the cast are extremely weak big peter breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame br br if one of your children of any age appears to be finding benji entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication br br then again what do i know i'm only a child,0
4033,every episode i saw when i was an innocent child was stupid there were some funny looking puppets called the mitts who would always discuss childhood things they would play this song before the mitts part of the show that goes like this let's join the mitts there was a groucho marx puppet that told jokes before the session this man would sing hot fudge right on there was a green puppet with teeth that was called seymore we would always see more seymore he would crack jokes and sing every episode there was always a moral in every episode one episode a man sang liars are losers another episode he was singing about sharing and caring seymore said tell me about those two little girls sharon and karen the hot fudge holey part has this man doing weird stuff and they played weird music,1
4034,this may be the most tension filled movie i have ever seen br br in fact it's so nerve wracking i haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago but i will since i have the dvd there were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch so if you've got problems and need to escape for an hour and half this film will get your mind off anything else br br the russian actress marina did a super job in facial expressions alone which she had to do since her character in here is a mute she plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker after the day's shooting is done and billie is about to leave she hears something she takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse type building br br there are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out the first i described above the second scene the climactic one goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first in fact the film should have been trimmed a bit but overall since it's so good at keeping our attention then it served its purpose as entertainment,1
4035,this is one of the most satisfying of the book to tv adaptations the actress who make us believe that a borg could be sexy makes us believe that a spy and traitor can have some redeeming qualities br br the tv plot line does not follow cornwell's story exactly but is both exciting and rewarding as a retelling of a darn good yarn if you have a yen for romance in uniform there is a lot of sexual energy sparking between our man sharpe and the lying hussy made me wish her role was closer to that in the books but no matter there is enough hero wronged hero redeemed hero in rage hero in flight and hero in battle to keep you clued to your dvd play,1
4036,excellent performance by mary kay place steve jacqueline bissett and johnson superb story that reels you into the movie emotional yet light hearted i own this movie and everyone that i've shared it with loves it great for mixed company 18 crowd br br nice production not a cheap budget well organized and keeps your interest uses dome newer ideas for flashbacks and at one point keeps the viewer at the edge of their seat br br no matter what walk of life a viewer is from they will buy in to one or more viewpoints in this film br br would love to see a sequel,1
4037,i just had the opportunity to see hitherto known in the u s as 'the golden door' and was very impressed by both it's dreamy occasionally surreal tale of a family that from to the u s in the early days of the 20th century it also worked as a proverbial middle finger jammed into the eyeball of homeland security preferably all the way up to the 3rd knuckle in it's depiction of the ill treatment of foreigners who just want a better life than they were getting from their original mother land the mostly italian cast with a few exceptions works well this is a quiet understated film that is lovely to look at the occasional but tasteful use of surrealism is always a pleasure while the screenplay is well written this is a film for those who are sick tired of mindless escapism from hollywood that serves little more than to sell popcorn not that i have any burning issues with popcorn mind you i actually love the stuff you would do wise to seek out the golden door or whatever it's being titled in your area,1
4038,a majority of exclusively made for video low budget fright flicks from the 80's invariably stink worse than raunchy old socks this particularly dismal and amateurish no budget chicago set bargain basement nasty necrophiliac nutcase on the loose bloodbath serves as a depressing affirmation of this borderline fact a bearded disheveled long haired bead and flower shirt wearing wild eyed psycho hippie fruitcake embarks on your standard random gruesome killing spree graphically slaughtering libidinous young couples who are engaging in strenuous coitus whenever the deranged lunatic attacks hmm do i detect a fairly obvious and self righteously puritanical have sex and die message here gee could be man boy is this mentally unbalanced sicko one real way gone pup after his female victims our certifiably crackers killer enjoys making love to their freshly slain bodies warning possible spoiler ahead towards the picture's end the corpse copulating crazy gets rudely interrupted by the cops while he's in the middle of doing the unthinkable with a nubile cadaver thereby provoking the foul pervert to cut loose with an understandably anguished and ear splitting cry of nooo now ain't this gonzo guy a definite sweetheart and a half br br too bad this flick is so poorly done if it had only been made with a modicum of flair and proficiency it could have been a sleazy little gem of a horror exploitation item alas wally koz's ham fisted direction lamar larry stubbornly static and immobile cinematography frankie hollywood insipid monotonously head banging hard rock score the pitifully cheap and unconvincing make up f x flat conspicuously uneasy plywood acting by a hideously all thumbs and unappealing non pro cast lethargic pacing too much screen time is tiresomely squandered on the police's drab efforts to catch the wacko an especially lame would be shocking surprise ending the mystery killer's true identity is guaranteed to have you groaning in disgust the uniformly boring incessantly bickering and positively braindead characters and a steady succession of dull soft core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two slugs mate for 90 minutes straight all add up to one profoundly putrid and unrewarding limp soggy noodle of a crummy clinker however to be fair this film does possess one stellar virtue the mad dog slasher has unquestionably excellent taste in garishly tropical louder than thunder day glo hawaiian shirts,0
4039,normally i try to avoid barbie films but this one was unmistakably awesome kudos to the graphics and character voice overs it all flowed well this enchanting tale is a great spin off of others but is well worth buying i don't have kids but the kids i babysit including boys find it intriguing and love the extra features on the dvd i honestly don't know why this is rated so low but for kids especially your barbie lovin' 8 year old will love this its not straight forward and predictive like most movies are this childrens film has excellent morals and shows teamwork it has no swearing bits of romance if your old enough to figure it out and beautifully written storyline thats why i am giving it a ten out of ten,1
4040,this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today horribly predictable obscene usage of slow motion photography cheesy story lines chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment i will give the series some credit though it does get entertaining at times but not enough for it make any difference with all the negative points this series has i still prefer it over reality tv it can't really get any more worthless than that,0
4041,i wasn't expecting to much of this movie when i went into the theater but i had been waiting for it for many years to sum it up it was pretty damn good chad michael murray was pretty good i thought he was going to be another chris flynn from wrong turn but i was wrong elisha cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to brian van holt he played the bad guy too well i mean he was sick sadistic and very cruel the back story between the brothers was good plus i liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die jon abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of cmm i liked how chad kind of cried when he found him dead it was better then just him being like whatever my buddy is dead who cares it showed how he really cared so overall this was a darn god slasher with some great effects bravo,1
4042,valley girl launched nicolas cage's career and was an 80's version of romeo and juliet it is a definite example of an 80's teen classic nicolas cage deborah foreman and elizabeth daily all have brilliant portrayals in this movie but it will never top fast times at ridgemont high as the ultimate 80's teen flick because if it weren't for fast times then the 80's generation of teen flicks would just be a big blow to the head that's for sure,1
4043,when i heard disney had the rights to underdog i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affair and we'd get a great adults kids film like the incredibles alas i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth what were they thinking underdog was a product of the 60's your prime fanbase is in their 40's and 50's why would you it to 5 year olds it should have been done ala roger rabbit half animated half real instead we get characters like riff raff a wolf dumbed into another dog underdog can't have an energy pill as we're now so enlightened it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference the only good casting was patrick warburton as cad because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version otherwise old school underdog fans should avoid this like the plague it is what next a live action version of the go go disguised as a re history lesson my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this,0
4044,the first time i saw the poster i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty then the city of istanbul has been haunting in my mind ever since br br not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture it itself is a landscape br br actually there are a lot of things going on in the film but the director deliberately omitted most dramatic parts and leave them to our imagination thus creating a really flat life mild spoiler one can see ladylove crying in the toilet and then going out without a word but not their fight one can see accompanying his mother in the hospital but not her struggle from illness the most dramatic scene in the film to me is laughing out loud for the toy soldier he bought for his niece and that's when it almost broke my heart to see this boring lonely life bursting out in such a way br br with all the trivialities in life the story presents us with pure inner world of all the characters their sadness anxiety loneliness regrets and as the story unfolded i sort of finally grasped their desperate situation where their emotions were really no way out if no outer things intervened which is exactly every loner tries to keep at all cost especially for an irresponsible artist like br br i've just finished my second watching last night i into my quilt had some vodka beside my bed and went through the whole film in a trance i felt two real lives going on one outside the screen one inside the screen i felt free from all those loneliness and anxiety 'cause the people inside were experiencing it i just had myself removed from all those things br br we cannot deny the universal problem of communication and loneliness even puts us far towards it and it becomes a vicious spiral i bet still didn't figure out a way of living in the end that's why he stepped out of his room to try to find the answers from the outer world the coldness and landscape,1
4045,this may just be the worst movie ever produced worst plot worst acting worst special effects be prepared if you want to watch this the only way to get enjoyment out of it is to light a match and burn the tape of it knowing it will never fall into the hands of any sane person again,0
4046,ok so is a hunk but the rest of the 3 hours were wasted wasted oh the humanity br br poor sean astin had to follow his master up the very same hills of new zealand that wait it be someone in the production crew of lord of the rings was making home movies in his spare time yes that's it br br i wish i could at least say he was promising br br the special effects were often laughable br br but was a hunk br br,0
4047,i have waited a long time to see this movie ifc finally ran it one night i thought it would be something like barfly from barbet schroeder wrong this film doesn't recreate that underworld of chintzy dirty smoke filled character filled bars you associate with his stories it also fails to capture that bukowski attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film that natural smart ass attitude fans of charles bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works this film looks like just another 'movie of the week about a drunk and his relationships if you want to get a better idea about charles bukowski's world watch barfly,0
4048,it's a horror story alright but perhaps not as you know it the real monsters in this flick are humans while the monsters are human and prey as weird as that may sound i see this as monsters inc for horror film fans br br sure the effects are of a std horror film the monsters are there as in any monster based film the gore is there as well there even is a slasher in the shape of dr decker played by david cronenberg i see flash of cillian murphy as dr jonathan crane in batman begins here or is it the other way round and it is decker c who are the bad guys the monsters want mainly to mind their own business off intrusive humans more or less misguided wanting to join there society br br by the end of the film you actually grow to like the quite little monsters and the dog not perhaps what you had expected from the first few scenes,1
4049,not to be mistaken as the highly touted samuel l jackson vehicle snakes on a plane snakes on a train is low budget features no actors to speak of but some pretty decent visual effects an attractive young woman julia ruiz does not want to marry choice for her husband so she is put under a powerful mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body slowly devouring from the inside out her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in texas time is running out for her and she is put on a train from el paso to los angeles before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size the passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes the finale sequence is no doubt the best of this 91 minute flick also receiving acting credit are castro al and giovanni,0
4050,i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d' martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first,1
4051,a conversation about how jan michael vincent is a lush led me to foolishly re visit this mid 90s dtv entry a kid is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man gunned down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho ice cream man clint howard something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream blah blah blah br br director norman credited as paul norman made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward that is what you get for having all murders happen off screen and for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit just cast a fat kid also there is a scene where vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies surrounding him he was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his have i really sunk this low shame full on despite being low budget trash this did line up a few good names including david naughton olivia hussey david warner and the people court's own doug how you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me,0
4052,is one of the best new danish tv series that i have watched br br the series is about the danish police force's unit 1 a kinda fbi style team that help solve murder cases all over the country and the cases they work on plus the influence that their jobs have on their personal lives and the price they sometimes has to pay to be a part of a top police team br br i didn't expect much when i started watching this series i was pleasantly surprised the series is exciting sometimes fun it's got both drama and suspense i love it,1
4053,i was invited to an early screening of the movie about four months before it was released i had to watch the film and later fill out a packet on my thoughts it was the hardest thing to sit through on earth the show just crawls by and you quickly begin wishing you were dead the thing is there are two types of mormon films the good ones with actual good stories and the crappy ones that just plain stink saints and soldiers now there is a good movie but with these wannabe comedies the writers and the actors just try too hard basically they try to be funny when they are not no wonder why there is such a small target audience for these films they're filled with 'inside jokes' that aren't funny to begin with and they just try to poke fun at average things it's the story that makes the movie and the stories for these movies are just weak i bet you can guess what my packet looked like when i was told to fill it out after the movie,0
4054,this is another one of hitchcock's highest rated movies and rightfully so this is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies one of them robert walker takes it seriously and this leads guy haines farley granger to trouble with the law another fast moving hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning not a movie to be missed it is a shame that no one will re release this on dvd with loads of extras just a cheap warner brothers dvd is all thats out there now,1
4055,well i tend to watch films for one of three reasons unfortunately there are no transformers in this film so i can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women read girls br br yes it is funny i know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout personally though i loved it for laura fraser who imho is fit,1

4057,eric ability to roll from character to character in this 'one man show' exhibits his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience,1
4058,this is a funny film and i like it a lot cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee this is of course the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well a comedy for a night when you don't want to have to think much it's well worth a rent,1

4060,the story told by the cranes are flying is not admittedly all that original young lovers are separated by war bad things happen to both we've seen it many times before br br nonetheless we haven't seen it filmed this well with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation or destruction or hopelessness all the more remarkable coming from the soviet union and reason to conclude that tarkovsky is not the last word in modern era soviet cinema br br i was reading chekhov's three sisters the other day and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film in act 2 objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding br br surely mankind must believe in something or at least seek for the truth otherwise life is just emptiness emptiness to live and not to know why the cranes are flying why children are born why there are stars in the sky either you must know why it is you live or everything is trivial mere pointless nonsense br br likewise veronika has a hard time believing that the war and her and others' sufferings have been pointless better to assign a meaning to live as if one's life is significant and not to give in to despair it is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film br br btw as a minor correction to one other comment here there may be a pattern of in the film though i hadn't noticed them myself but the first letter of name is not a further instance of this in the alphabet her name begins with a letter which looks like an english b,1
4061,edward crossfire is a rare film coming from the hollywood of the 1940s this was groundbreaking territory for mr and the studio because of what the director and his adapter john paxton decided to do with the novel in which the film is based br br if you haven't seen the film please stop reading now br br richard brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier in the movie the subject matter was turned around to prejudice against jews a theme that was taboo during that time in the american cinema it's to mr credit to have had the courage to get involved with this film project at all br br the movie is an outstanding piece of film making because the way the director presents it obviously influenced by the film noir style we are taken to the washington of the post war the opening scene about the brutal murder of shows such unusual cruelty being inflicted to a decent man who we don't know yet or why has been killed but who didn't deserve to die in such horrible fashion br br the basis of the murder is prejudice pure and simple we realize how in the mind of an ignorant man the mere fact of being successful and different plays in the mind of the assassin stands as the sacrificial lamb the same way the gay soldier is the victim in the novel the parallels are well drawn br br this film makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of robert ryan as montgomery mr ryan was an actor that always played interesting roles but never so well as in crossfire also there is a great appearance by gloria grahame as ginny the prostitute with her heart in the right place br br the rest of the cast play as an ensemble robert young as the police detective in charge of the investigation plays is a decent man who has known prejudice first hand in his own family and speaks loudly against it robert mitchum plays a cool sgt who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it sam levene is excellent in his small role of br br this is a film to watch because of it probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance,1
4062,film noir at its best set in the immediate aftermath of wwii 1946 crossfire depicts the good bad and ugly of that time monty montgomery kills sam because sam's a jew and therefore automatically perceived through monty's narrow lens to have been a slacker who got out of fighting the war monty doesn't like people like that the truth is that sam was a soldier too but the truth is something which disappears when you're feeling right about the ideologies of hate you've been immersed in and the world is full of dirty this and thats badly in need of your brand of cleansing br br monty is a sadist in winning soldier's clothing the losers of wwii had more than their share as well hate filled prejudiced leaders and soldiers as well some of them were hung for war crimes like starting a war of aggression br br this movie got its makers in trouble when that other sadistic of america joe mccarthy got his hearings going in the early 1950s br br see crossfire just to see how good an actor robert ryan was the real robert ryan was no monty he was a great if underestimated under used actor br br see crossfire and get a taste of the dark side of post wwii america see it to get a taste of the good side of late 40s america as well robert and robert young also play leading roles could have played ryan's role in fact he did when he played the psychopath in cape fear,1
4063,family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6 although i enjoyed blue harvest it felt like the remaining episodes were wrapping up episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy's reputation of american social satire br br i have seen all the episodes from season 7 and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now more fun br br i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together this show however has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be great job,1

4065,john wayne's first starring role just blew me away televised letterbox style on amc i had to check and make sure i had the right date sure enough this 1930 film was made using a 55 mm wide screen process aside from that it features some of the grittiest most realistic footage of the trek west i've seen wagons men and animals are really lowered down a cliff face by rope trees are chopped by burly men and burly women so the train can move another 10 feet the indians are not the pretty boy city slickers who portrayed them later they're the real deal a river crossing in a driving rain storm is so realistic it has to be real in fact i understand that director raoul walsh nearly lost the entire cast during this sequence i could smell the wet canvas each day is an agony the various sub plots are forgettable but the film as a whole is not i can't think of another title that can beat the big trail in evoking a sense of living history on the trail to oregon bravo,1
4066,this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies it may have been considered racy in its time and may have made money but even the most die hard jane russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck br br there are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time even though dated by current standards but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot the french line however fails at all of these aspects br br it doesn't matter that russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material the entire cast is dragged down by a boring trite plot and dialogue br br it's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers they're crummy,0
4067,i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local pbs station played while growing up got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee as well as camera copies of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts i had a great time w the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously i mean as seriously as a sci fi show about a time traveler could be i went to the cons did the costume bit doctor 5 6 and tegan were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a old antique that drifted into the ethos br br when i heard that the sci fi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what i've been babbling on about all these years and know what the heck a tardis is i have several phone boxes and of various sizes around the house i didn't expect the excellent quality of story character development and f x i was to say the least pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasn't a curmudgeon a clown a fop a trip head a pussy or a jerk christopher eccleston is by far the most believable doctor to date now now calm down tom baker fans don't get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and his quirks but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before real word believability i'm just sad that he decided against another season i'll try out david tennant as i would any other doctor but now the bar has risen br br bad wolf rules br br 2008 update i love david tennant his mod persona is something that my generation remembers my son's generation can deal with and fashion gestapo can relax he's a little more human than christopher but not as as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble it's still the best ride on tv,1
4068,this is very much overrated i guess it carries some nostalgic value for many people it has its moments but every scene is heavily overacted and the plot is quite shallow with this cast it could have been much better,0
4069,while watching blackwater valley exorcism i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh i ate a rabbit i told you she was possessed are you telling me the devil is in my daughter br br there are many many more but you must discover these for yourself if you dare br br the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort even the priest and i haven't even gotten to the bad acting most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelle's father the director must have just told him to act like he's got a stick up his because that's the general impression one gets br br i don't really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be had for all the wrong reasons but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary well run don't walk,0
4070,there are no no redeeming qualities to this film they didn't check a single fact not one about anything i feel sorry for larry miller and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue br br the adults are all idiotic the effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality the music is honestly cheesy the plot is beyond belief br br i you want to see something good with your family see anything else take some time and check for in your attic my ten year old is mocking this film as we watch it he's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching,0
4071,functioning as a sort of midpoint between waiting for guffman and a mighty wind best in show portrays a dog show and the various people who bring their canine friends to participate some are weird some crazy and otherwise but they all make the movie good director christopher guest is particularly funny as gay harlan pepper very much trying to promote his dog eugene levy parker posey michael catherine o'hara and bob balaban also do great jobs i can't imagine them not doing great jobs at least not in a christopher guest movie as someone who's never attended a dog show this movie is my main exposure to them they sure look neat,1
4072,once again we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment much of it involving the band's occasionally funny lyrics into a 90 minute package for anyone old enough to remember this is along lines of the first bill and ted without the story line if that doesn't say enough as to how brainless this movie is think about jack black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point if you actually like listening to tenacious d because of their musical prowess then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack don't waste your time with this though if your a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs you're still barking up the wrong tree no matter the potency of your buds you'll still be left wishing you'd popped in grandma's boy again instead,0
4073,i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one not only is she not on screen much but nothing her character does is essential to the plot her character could be written out of the story without changing it much,0
4074,poorly directed short film shot on hi def or betacam it appears it screams student film video all the way the premise is limited in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs some interesting acting moments and some decent production value but not enough to lift this film from the hole it has fallen into,0
4075,caught this flick as one of a five for 5 deal from a local video store and it was a most pleasant surprise it's a collection of four interrelated tales built around four kids who've just had a car wreck and are waiting for someone to pick them up they tell each other these stories to kill time and are occasionally startled by flashing lights and funny noises which all come together in an o henry esque ending that left me gleeful a real discovery blood and plenty of it breasts and beasts round it all out rather nicely barrett is worth the price of admission alone this one is a keeper jim bob says check it out br br oddly enough pumpkinhead was one of our five choices too and imdb recommends that for anyone who likes campfire tales i'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one samhain,1
4076,milos forman's original hair was the perfect movie that actually revealed how life was changing in those years not only in the usa but especially in this country one of the plots in the film was to be used in other films to come after hair for example in american etc it was an original story with a touch of generational sadness in it the characters in the film were like lonely cells in a body that was changing all over overall a very good film perhaps a little underrated though annie role was minor but she acted very well it was the film that practically launched john savage as an actor one of the members of the chicago played his role well even though it was a minor role,1
4077,there's lots of ketchup but not a whole lot of sense in the supposedly explanatory third sequel which piles on the naff visuals to no effect good old alan smithee directed this one in which various members of the same family all played poorly by bruce ramsay are terrorised by pinhead doug bradley wheeled out of mothballs for the umpteenth time peter atkins tries to imbue his script with poetic touches but doesn't seem to realise that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick the incoherent plot fails to adequately fill the movie's meagre running time although this may have more to do with studio interference than anything the filmmakers intended,0
4078,it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the us br br anyway this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years closely followed by the waterboy br br why because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one mixed them put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it br br examples nothing the music gets scary and still nothing the grumpy officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class there´s a buddy moment which comes out of nowhere at the end there´s an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone br br if you want to see a smart movie see memento if you want to see a better thriller see any thriller that comes to mind if you want to see patrick swayze see dirty dancing,0
4079,i don't have a really solid thesis here so i'm just going to toss out some observations br br first of all the film is absolutely gorgeous it's shot in high contrast black and white and some of the scenes are so well composed that they're almost distracting br br there's a sequence early on of some intense protests and some of the shots were amazing three guys launching tear gas at the protesters etc br br second of all i think that one of the biggest signs that this is a recent film looking back on the 60's is that it's really about how the idealism of the revolution morphed and shifted into something different the take on this shift is really interesting i think that both the political phase of things as well as the artistic and more self indulgent phase have strong points and weak points the film doesn't necessarily take the position that things decayed br br third i think the romance works very well br br finally i really really really hated the ending it was way too melodramatic you could even say that the ending is unworthy of the film that preceded it,1
4080,i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i'll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater which was sold out was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge,1
4081,this movie was terrible my friend and i were so bored by it we fast forwarded through the last half of the movie just to see what happened it's the typical sports thing she either wins or she loses the only remotely interesting thing was when the one guy refers to someone as a veg e tab le that will be a line my friend and i bring up for years to come reminding us of this colossal cheesy cliche waste of time,0
4082,when recounting these events that took place some years ago hard to believe this actually happened i thought well there is a basis for an interesting story here many secrets were never uncovered the horse never found the main conspirators never captured etc br br however this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention payed to the plot some other questions are raised though like why on earth would mickey rourke be in this film its good to see career has taken off again but he must cringe at the mention of this rubbish br br if the subject matter interests you do an internet search on the topic you'll be more educated and dare i say more entertained avoid this,0
4083,i am biased because i appear in this film but i loved it and i am only in about seven dispersed minutes and am not nearly the most interesting part of it the film is an honest and intriguing account of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovable movie it is also an account of bloated expectations and fallen heros the interviews are well patched together in the editing the different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person also the interviews are shot in a pretty interesting fashion keeping the film visually satisfying definitely a worthwhile film i hope it gets around,1
4084,yep it's me again mr 'i sit through crap so you don't have to' br br what do you think this is about could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area then her cross dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor before they make off together with his cash wow what a guess and if i tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant da to nail these suckers what conclusion will you come to do you reckon the sexy da will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the maverick officer who has already handed in his gun and badge zing you get 10 points br br frankly this film bored me to tears why do people insist on making this kind of rubbish its a waste of our time their time and yet they still carry on regardless filming a movie that no one gives an iota about if it has any redeeming features there's the fact that it has some of the prettiest ladies i've seen in a motion picture for a while i hope they spent what meagre wages they earned on plenty of botox and they'd look great on the cover of vogue or perched on the top of a car in a bikini they should just leave acting to the professionals like shannon tweed br br talking about future careers i ran into the director the other day he sure does whip up a tasty chicken burger meal i must say too that the uniform really does suit him i asked him about 'party line' and his eyes went to the floor before he mumbled something about extra fries oh well guess it didn't quite work out never mind they're letting him take over the drive thru tomorrow hurray 1 10,0
4085,bad bad movie so bad it is worth watching as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie it's worth it the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair how anti climatic is that maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something he does join his sister in the belly oh didn't mean to spoil it for you,0
4086,if you are looking for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously than haggard is for you i must say before i write anything more that if you have not seen any of the camp kill yourself videos than the movie most likely won't be as funny my advice is to watch a few clips of those videos that bam and his friends made haggard does not take itself seriously at all and that was never the purpose throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control even through all that the plot does stay focused and the story of ryan dunn's character does unfold quite nicely this plot i have been told is based off a true story for the most part of ryan dunn's ex girlfriend brandon is by far the best character in the movie he has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh he stole the movie if you ask me overall i love this movie for its simplicity and straight up weirdness its a bam movie people its not going to be normal haggard is filled with hilarious quotes that my friends and i constantly used since the first time we saw it i've seen the movie 6 7 times and still find new things every time the soundtrack is just as good everything from kill to new order and some techno just don't go into the movie with high expectations let it all unfold and then judge it for what it is,1
4087,a humorous voyage into the normally somber funeral business it's easy watching and even offers blethyn molina stealing a scene from an old fred ginger movie walken is over the top as a zealous competitor of molina in the undertaking business trying to bring a new style to an old welsh town we see a couple of very funny examples of the new style the plot thickens with pugh having an affair with watts and her suggesting that they do blethyn in meanwhile molina has his long suffering romantic feeling for blethyn and convinces her to fake her death so that they can run away to the south seas and dance away their days together during the fake funeral blethyn learns of her husbands' infidelities and plots her revenge watch it for a view of what funerals probably should be a celebration of life,1
4088,it's hard to decide what to say about this one it isn't totally one hundred percent bad although the movie in a movie is unspeakably bad meant to be campy but missing by a mile i'm pretty sure that this is intentional however danny aiello is perfectly adequate here and more or less nails his pathetic character dyan cannon was good in a small role was impressive as the latest twenty something girlfriend and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well br br so it's not totally bad but i don't believe that this one accomplishes its goals all in all it's probably worth passing on,0
4089,peter strauss by nature of appearing in mini series and made for tv films often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film having channel hopped into it half way through well i've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about the jericho mile that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film br br peter strauss won an emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br br looking to be objective i attempted to criticise this film instead i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit picks this is what true realistic film making is about this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism where everything is overacted it's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event,1
4090,the three names that mean the most to this film are burt reynolds mark wahlberg and julianne moore these three deliver the strongest performances but the entire cast does a wonderful job the film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise on the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle i think there was some overkill in this department paul thomas anderson has not done a great deal of directing but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work the dirk diggler story one thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work live and party together although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other the wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage there are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well br br the story is about a gifted young man named eddie adams wahlberg that gets invited into the porn industry he changes his name to dirk diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight jack horner reynolds is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography but that they are true art however dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything although a greater focus is placed on the character dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life you will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve all in all a well done film,1
4091,when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work i love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones but this takes the cake the plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring i don't mean to keep criticizing the script and plot because believe me that is not the worst part i have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors and i was impressed with taylor locke this being one of his first movies the worst part of the movie was the special effects they reeked of low budget and really ruined the viewers entertainment even if he had been remotely interested in the plot i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors,0
4092,jon cryer reprises his role as a neurotic guy in two and a half men which he perfected in this series he longs to have a good relationship with a girl like his coworker has developed and the tet a tet between him and his partner's girlfriend's best friend are pretty funny then they realize that they're attracted to each other and start dating in one of the funniest lines on tv ever i think in the final episode he and his partner are discussing that he wants to propose to the girl br br his partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting what's the worst that can happen she says no br br armed with newfound optimism he proposes to his date over dinner to which she replies br br god no br br i laughed so hard i cried,1
4093,a young man who never knew his birth parents receives an old farm in an isolated section of west virginia upon the death of his natural father he visits his property with a cross section of potential victims including the comic relief black guy and a trendy lesbian couple hmm will there be skinny dipping take a guess unfortunately the party comes to an end when the spirits of drifters killed by his evil great grandfather and used as scarecrows come back for revenge this film starts out well an artful montage of depression era photographs and phony newspapers set against a speech by fdr this i believe is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie establishes the mood i developed some hopes for the film which were partially realized the story was serviceable enough the setting was sufficiently bucolic the photography was mostly in focus the acting while no great shakes was slightly above par for horror movies in this budget range the film might've actually worked within the narrow demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary but they weren't they looked cheap they weren't frightening at all the better the monster the better the movie these scarecrows wouldn't scare dorothy let alone toto,0
4094,watching this movie i can't help drawing the comparison between it and wild reeds another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of age br br like wild reeds this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried so if you want a quick resolution to things don't watch it this movie is like a slice of life beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly there's no resolution to anything no happily ever after for anybody just like real life br br this movie is as real as it gets the acting is surprisingly good the director is fond of long really long shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts br br i love this movie i almost didn't watch it but now i'm very glad that i did it's not a movie for everyone but if you're willing to let it grow on you you will be rewarded br br 10 10,1
4095,nice doco br br even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing br br it is self evident how much you put into it br br that goes for everyone else too it's great to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too nice' br br loved it well worth a view br br que pena the writer of 'the original' film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved br br love the attitude too great piece looking forward to seeing the next work br br keep going bro,1
4096,i love the way he experiments ab tak was a thrill to watch just as much satya and company was the new comer also lived up to his role and nana patekar was at his best was really irritating but i think he fit the character he was playing he had really ugly teeth the story has a great progress and no songs in the movie makes it better i only wish he signs up urmila for his other up coming movies i think they are the best director and actress combination i have seen i have not seen as yet but i am looking forward for it i for some reason don't find that exciting to watch on the screen unlike urmila,1
4097,this is a cut above other movies of the genre genuinely suspenseful intelligent brilliantly acted and visually stunning yes the plot can be confusing but that's partly what makes it pack such a punch watch it twice if you can you'll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time br br don't be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea a country not too familiar to most western audiences while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific the underlying themes are all too universal guilt anger loss madness and retribution all of these are handled superbly by lim su jeong as su mi the lead character also worthy of particular mention is yum jung ah who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother br br while it has its scary moments this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it it's more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end and possibly beyond,1
4098,this movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it ever got made for example they get into the sewers from the capitol and while they're in the sewers you can see signs pointing to various government buildings and then they come up in the middle of the street i highly doubt that government buildings would provide public access through the city sewer system anyways i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 just because of its comic value i laughed the whole way through at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie,0
4099,i've sat through several pauly shore movies but this is the only one that i've liked of course it helps that he is far less irritating than usual perhaps even a little likeable the rest of the cast does a fine job especially underrated carla the film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy and although few of the jokes are especially funny the film is quite entertaining overall,1
4100,this is primarily about love in wwii yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for dylan thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life br br the movie's timing is just great it really captures what i think would have been the spirit during those times smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed while it may prove boring to some the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it br br at one point my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax it really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors cillian murphy is on fine form here as is matthew rhys both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch the relationship formed between sienna miller and keira knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank and watch out for a cameo by of 'madness' br br despite all of this it's a rather slow movie coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion br br overall it's a solid non fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well known british names behind the scenes but it really does drone on for too much at times still a worthwhile watch 7 10,1
4101,i rarely even bother to watch comedic movies or television these days they're insipid vulgar and most importantly not funny this one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past it's worth watching and i don't believe it would be dated in any significant way classic humor is classic humor and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created br br i would love to see this film again it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar summer school on television recently like that slightly newer film meatballs is funny without being cruel overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor the key of course is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character maybe even a virtually life saving change and how they both grow up in the space of a summer,1
4102,from the director of oldboy comes this slick vampire flick kang ho song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly mysterious virus his vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some blood because of his supposedly miraculous survival he comes into the lives of ha kyun shin's family shin has cancer and his mother believes that song can cure it unfortunately song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help but fall for shin's young wife ok vin kim kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism and the two become lovers the film from there goes in weird directions that i think one should experience for themselves what really should be mentioned is chan wook park's mastery of the medium of cinema my god i've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers the major flaw of the film is that it's a little incoherent especially near the beginning park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals which can be difficult to follow at times but when it works man does it fly the film is also perversely hilarious the final sequence easily one of the best of the decade is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous ok vin kim should become a worldwide star after this film she gives one of the best performances of the year,1
4103,i honestly found wicked little things to be a very cool and fun horror film my friend had given this to me and i really saw it as nothing but a crappy low class gory horror film then after i watched this i was wrong it was very cool and very good and while ill say it seemed a bit unnecessary at times and while it may not be the best horror film ever its still good i thought the acting was very good especially from the girl who plays the mother she seemed very believable and to me very likable and while it is a little and over the top its good overall i gotta say if the horror fest films are not your style then you should have no business watching this but if you like horror films or a wicked little time than check out wicked little things 8 0 out of 10 stars,1
4104,thankfully i watched this film alone enabling me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i don't find the movies hottie to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies br br if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear,0
4105,the basic plot is good and can be engaging the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie so how did this movie end up so poor well the plot was about 95 predictable and the characters were about as 1 dimensional as possible and the dialog what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull crap that purports to be dialog you get much greater realism from most cartoons the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clichés and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome and this is a shame because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess if you don't believe me look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie way in excess of what you'd expect to find they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems so as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re write and re editing,0
4106,pink flamingos is a cult classic the plot of this film revolves around the challenge to supremacy as the filthiest person alive pink flamingos contains some memorably repulsive scenes like a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eats fresh dog feces yes the movie is shocking and funny at the same time but the biggest laughs come from the actors' lines check out especially this line from divine kill everyone now condone first degree murder advocate cannibalism eat s filth is my politics filth is my life on the whole i really enjoyed this film still its tagline an exercise in bad taste should be taken to heart and even those used to the gross out movies today may find this gem hard to stomach highly recommended,1
4107,mst3k fodder it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason there are some hilarious things in it such as the mysterious device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that flutters around carrying and firing a machine gun without so much as a wobble but is brought down by a bag of balloons the kind they release at political conventions many other wonderful touches of that sort stars charlie sheen there's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation only to drop the in the river by accident if they'd cast emilio estevez in the part that never would've happened,0
4108,a rather silly little film you just may love br br although rather corny and cliché at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team br br notable for several screen debuts including david naughton's first film role after his dr pepper be a pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit american werewolf in london also features paul in what i believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll a year before he became known for it and last but not least mr spin city and alex keaton himself michael j fox gets his first film role here fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house outside of that no names but all funny characters br br doubt it has ever made it to dvd but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late late show sometime if you do is worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love,1
4109,i totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film having read the book being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really like similar to hubert selby's writing i expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this isabelle hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi layered character there are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and i can imagine few actresses who would do so well with so much disregard for their own reputation or image there is this coldness distance cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness hurt and pain there's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear i think it's an excellent film but i did not enjoy watching it it's not boring but there are times when i wished it would end btw her male counterpart is very well acted as well and i think well chosen too,1
4110,a scarily real drama there isn't another drama out there that has scared the crap out of me like this has the characters are not your typical islamic terrorist you have a blonde haired blue eyed guy who is as dumb as he looks he is a converted muslim a well respected business man who pretends to be jewish and a frenchman who has converted to islam but has clearly taken the word of the koran to a whole new level the hero of the plot is who is an undercover fbi agent who has infiltrated the terrorist cell and has to do all sorts of god awful things to prevent himself from being detected the first episode is a small taste of what's to follow although it is about islamic terrorists the drama has a unique way of pointing out that not all muslims are extremists which is comforting to those concerned with racism considering half the terrorist cell are islam converts it makes you think that maybe they are the ones to be afraid of the most chilling drama i've ever seen the reason its so chilling is cause you never know who your friends your husband or your neighbours really are terrorists can be anyone anywhere anytime,1
4111,i love sandra bullock she's one of my all time favorite actresses but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash canned i realize that it's almost 20 years old but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did beware it's not even worth the 5 50 walmart rack you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks the sound quality is horrendous there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog and it looks as if it were filmed on a 1 98 budget i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress but yikes is too kind a word to use,0
4112,michael caine usually appears in either very good blame it on rio sleuth without a clue gambit dirty rotten scoundrels or truly bad comedies noises off death becomes her harry walter go to ny this falls into the latter category br br ta is a comedy that succeeds in only two things managing to waste a cast that includes caine and richardson all of which have comedic abilities and succeeding in its mission not to make the viewer laugh there isn't a single truly funny moment here the main reason is the lousy script there was so much futile effort put into writing a pointlessly convoluted story which is simply too bothersome to follow considering it's only a comedy that the writer s forgot to make the damn thing funny which as far as i can recall is what the whole point of a comedy is supposed to be br br i've never seen this moron before some people even say if you're a moron fan you'll love this bla bla bla a moron fan does this non descript person really have fans a comedy as badly written as this requires a mega talent to eke out a laugh or two out of it someone like steve coogan and not your average moron br br if you're going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them out to be the utter morons that they usually are the characters of caine and moron are insufficiently dumb br br the single most annoying thing about this unfunny collection of scenes is the little girl only a truly horrible writer would think that to spice up a lousy script it's wise to include a super intelligent wise ass kid smart a kids aren't even funny to bill cosby fans any more in little miss sunshine we had a totally normal kid and she was very funny this stupid ol' the kid is smarter than the adults shtick belongs to a century old marx brothers film,0
4113,i found the movie very interesting i really enjoyed the film the actors were great it was entertainment benny the uncle was wonderful he was real at his character the ending took a wonderful twist i would recommend you seeing it eddie mores girlfriend reminded me a little of sandra bullock she was sharp as a nail i also like the little girls acting in the movie she was very convincing benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really lives his life growing up in brooklyn i loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot because thats how most people cook lol i actually watched the movie 2 times and learned more the second time,1
4114,the large bell in a bar intermittently rings for last orders and the inevitable rush to queue forms at the counter  do we want what we need only when it's too late or is the irony of the opening scene's wailing cassandra a more resonant reflection of our perceptions on individual existence there's an endless fascination about where writer director roy wants to take us in his fourth feature you the living with fifty or so semi related vignettes strung together by a penchant for hyper reality its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic sisyphean struggle the sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to the and immense of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another might whittle down the complexity of the human condition through harsh and fast cynicism more than he should but he also reminds us of the inherent reassuring glory of waking up each morning to a new tomorrow when we're all aware of our own distinct forms of arrested development,1
4115,if you live in the suburbs are relatively well off financially and do not really have much contact with the city life of england then this is the comedy for you not something a mass audience would go for but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics comparing it to bbc comedys like only fools and horses fawlty towers black adder and other classics this series tends to drift away from the bbc's regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture,0
4116,i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to with the wind' should ever have been undertaken having expressed that i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film making the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe,0
4117,i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film i enjoyed it its a sci fi film if you want a thriller watch another channel this is what the scifi lovers want excellently produced by one of sci fi's best producers scot ok the special effects weren't excellent but what a great cast some more money could have been used for effects but then again what sci fi has high budgeted effects stop complaining and change the channel if you don't like these type of films films like mission impossible and braveheart are great but these aren't sci fi films sci fi produces excellent films like sabretooth alien hunters etc well done keep them churning out,1
4118,i hope robert redford continues to make more films like this books are wonderful and as a young child raised in the southwest his stories hit home adam beach is a highly under rated and under used actor wake up hollywood not everyone thinks that your mel gibson's are cool many movie today want to see films that make you think i have seen all of the redford hillerman series they are thoughtful scenic and have great plots i'm hoping that if enough people write to robert redford he may decide to make a few more thank you adam beach and tony hillerman for great entertainment if anyone get's a chance to read tony latest book do so it's great i also recommend traveling through arizona new mexico utah and colorado stop at every view site and feel the setting of books amazing experience,1
4119,seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his mustang which is parked under the freeway now torn down and notices the charger sitting you know you are about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed adding to it is a terrific lalo if i remember correctly sound track this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing that shot of mcqueen's mustang suddenly appearing in bill rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect then of course san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends also bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still hot mustang gt and dodge charger made for a better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden in the 1970s seven ups bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups had a few jumps over little hills yawn but of course they were not san francisco hills the seven ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy pontiac is the height of absurdity strictly hollywood i would say except that it was filmed in new york,1
4120,this movie is not a horror movie there is nothing scary about it it's more of a torture flick and it doesn't make sense to me there is a few scene's with disappearing bodies for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i don't think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didn't kill him the at the end she sets the killer's truck on fire that but he's not in it he is standing behind her then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie save yourself some money and skip this movie,0
4121,the finest short i've ever seen some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened due to the density of insight it offers there's irony in that comment and little merit the acting is all up to noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly i might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect this is a short for people who read for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty a beautiful short film i was pleased at the picasso reference since i once believed that picasso was just another art whore with little talent like i assume most people until the day i saw some drawings he made when he was 12 picasso was a finer and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime i understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for,1
4122,i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about jefferson this film was not it it was rather long drawn out dull and unbalanced too much time was spent exploring relationship with and not enough time was spent on his relationship with sally hemmings the lady who played sally thandie newton was absolutely awful her acting was so bad it was like watching an a1 airhead trying to recite shakespeare her constant whining voice grated the nerves nolte's accent made jefferson sound like an ignorant man rather than a genius relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped yet his eldest daughter's rebellion patsy is a key event late in the film the film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement on the positive side the costumes were quite beautiful and greta scacchi played the part of well if you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and or jefferson then watch it's much better than jefferson in paris,0
4123,this flick was even better then for the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and little second second city troupe if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help 'em they just didn't get it it is a mockumentary something at which guest and levy have a genius for at the end of the movie where guest's southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on a or when he tells us that is an ancient art and we see a hieroglyphic br br of an ancient egyptian holding a tiny ancient egyptian in it's hand i realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mr guest and mr levy and god bless you,1
4124,for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some but not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order,1
4125,you got to see it to believe it shot in hollywood on the strip in the middle of the sleazy anything goes 70s this cheaply made flick must of really packed the inner city theatres back in the day then again i bet it had a one week run actually its pretty hilarious the acting is dreadful the direction non existent but the hair clothes rotten pre disco music and the general out and out sleaziness of the story are mind boggling sleazy its very sleazy highly if you can find it,1
4126,i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area the cast showed promise but when i saw the director george i became suspicious and sure enough it was every bit as bad every bit as pointless and stupid as every george movie i ever saw he's like a stupid man's michael bey with all the awfulness that accolade promises br br there's no point to the conspiracy no burning issues that urge the conspirators on we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next thus the current budget crisis the war in iraq islamic extremism the fate of social security 47 million americans without health care wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti br br a truly stunningly idiotic film,0
4127,when you read about this film you wanna cringe i have seen it countless times and yet i cringe myself so what is the attraction here i think that for me it's the of the romance i find it super refreshing to have an oddball coupling between this nyc jimmy breslin like columnist and a down on her luck health wise ballerina you feel embarrassed for paul sorvino at his unsubtle approach to wooing this woman like the guy in the bar who can't take a hint he's a bit overweight at least as a would be suitor for a ballerina hope that doesn't sound unkind and possibly a tad too old for her nice change of pace from greek god wooing super model the bill conti score has stuck in my head all these years later which is a pretty good sign however some of the acting is just dreadful a subplot involving a young puerto rican boy befriended by sorvino's character is just hilariously bad but the opening scene where is warming up to carole king draws you right into this story good luck finding it you'd think that lifetime would be re airing this or even we but i haven't seen it on in quite a few years,1
4128,although perhaps not as entertaining as some of herzog's work little dieter is another fine film by one of the world's greatest film artists departing from herzog's usual themes little dieter is a fascinating and uplifting character study about a brave man and his efforts to go on living after a life traumatic experience br br dieter wanted to fly from a very young age and the viet nam war gave him that opportunity but instead of spending the war soaring in a cockpit he spent most of it grounded as a pow dieter tells most of his story eloquently and passionately with occasional help from herzog herzog does very little voice over this time but contributes a lot of subtly powerful and visuals which should be no surprise to those familiar with him br br is a fascinating and extremely likable person as human and as alive as they come i found the story of his life and his upbeat personality to be inspiring thanks to herzog for re introducing him to us br br the scale of the film is not as sprawling and the drama is not as fierce as many of the early films that made herzog a force to be reckoned with nevertheless i strongly recommend this to his fans and to those who enjoy documentaries it's a very interesting and well executed film,1
4129,i'm starting to wonder if all these pg 13 horror movies are just glorified screen tests for young and emerging talent get a first time screenwriter an inexperienced director a few tv actors looking for their bigscreen break and see what they can do 'when a stranger calls' is a little better than most such recent offerings but is still completely by the book riddled with plot holes and genre clichés br br the story is unbelievably simplistic the slim 87 minute running time is heavily padded with inconsequential friends and a pointless cheating boyfriend the killer is devoid of even the token motivation of jason or michael or even the original movie's killer and as a result is never particularly frightening the police behave in such an unbelievably ineffectual and lazy manner as to verge on professional misconduct simon west brings the same attractive banality to proceedings that he managed with lara croft but his style of directing is decidedly generic possessing no of real talent or vision the performances are routine dark hallways replace genuine horror and the scares are of the tired cat in the closet variety br br the cinematography and production design however are above average for this kind of film the house is beautifully designed all dark wood and glassy reflections and there are a few moments that are of visual interest br br though lacking an ounce of dramatic originality it acts as a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller and maintains interest longer than most of its ilk,0

4131,my teacher did this movie it's a new beginning watch it and you won't notice that it is a romanian movie the old boring style has gone now it's something else a post revolutionary movie it is using the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists they are unique you won't even know that you're watching you will be simply transferred beyond the screen and you'll feel every frame don't miss it pay attention to the plot but don't ignore the details they make the difference between this movie and the others romanian movies you will hear some music at some point it's representative for a part of us but it does not represent us please just keep your head straight and leave your body free,1

4134,there is no esperanto in this movie br br i watched this movie specifically because imdb lists esperanto as one of the languages used but imdb is mistaken about the languages used in this film there is absolutely no esperanto at all it's almost all english with a couple of words of navajo do not watch this film if you're looking for esperanto movies other options instead are delight with clark gable which has a bit of esperanto incubus is all esperanto although completely mispronounced and there are some esperanto street signs in charlie chaplin's the great dictator there was supposed to be some spoken esperanto in gattaca as well but i never heard any br br aside from that the other reviewer is right this movie is a complete mess br br spend your time elsewhere,0
4135,grabbed my attention on netflix instant play because it was only an hour and a half long it's nearing 4 am here and because it's norwegian which i wanted to follow up with dead snow and see what else the country is offering in international cinema right now a droll and deliciously wry romp this movie features a man andreas who gets shipped out to some purgatory of a brave new world city where everyone is happy and bland and food has no taste nothing smells and even sex loses its appeal driven to the edge by his lack of common senses he feels nearly ready to kill himself br br after an hilarious botched attempt at latter andreas tracks down a man with similar complaints and the two discover a tiny vagina shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music emanates the two attempt to break through to see what is on the other side tracking a tiny bit of light they can barely see but of course in fantasy allegory land desire and nonconformity are not allowed and the elements of the city operate to end attempt at freedom and sensuality br br jens and crew create a simple straight forward movement to the story one that flows well with its themes and moves along at just enough of a pace to keep from lagging the similarities in other similar science fiction aren't worth enumerating but still the movie has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some pretty horrifying ones i like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie some disembowelment and that will get your heart stammering harder than the passion of the christ simply because it is so perfectly out of place from the gray toned mise en scene is a dependably squirrelly actor who physically feels out of place from his surroundings which works very well despite the fact that the concept itself isn't anything to write home about everyone involved makes it work and the movie fully realizes its own world br br polarisdib,1

4137,i saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the shorter version james summary of the content of the film is very good very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversity br br the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting but which does enable to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment br br despite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs but also undercutting a number of comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to a degree this evoked michael moore's recent work although operates in a more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls' the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of of the earth' french peasants as the stars de pere et fils were present at the screening and answered questions afterwards we do indeed all need a little disorder bravo hubert br br overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people and organise our world,1

4140,from start to finish this 1926 classic two reeler from the hal roach studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20's it stars the now forgotten comic genius charley chase and was directed by the legendary leo mccarey who was unknown then but would earn his keep with roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30's and 40's recently released onto video and disc this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages although today his star has virtually diminished charley chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents he helped the careers of stan laurel and oliver hardy before they were brought together as a team leo mccarey and a host of other talents it is a shame that he is all but remembered today check out this little gem of a film once you do you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic he had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star,1

4142,i was extraordinarily impressed by this film it's one of the best sports films i've every seen the visuals in this film are outstanding i love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup the film moves well offering both excitement and drama the cinematography was fantastic br br the acting performances are great i was surprised by young shia labeouf he does well in this role stephen is also good as the brooding harry peter firth justin and elias koteas offer able support the film is gripping and entertaining and for the first time in my life actually made me want to watch a golf tournament,1
4143,on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good it isn't br br the cast is pretty good but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing the real disaster in this film is not the flood but the script it attempts to include every cliché in the book all done incredibly poorly the ending is very abrupt but this is a blessing in disguise if you make it that far br br all three main male actors carlyle courtney and suchet would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers i hope they got paid a lot of cash because none of their reputations come out in tact br br the special effects are quite good but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow br br in short a pointless exercise don't waste your time,0
4144,solo is a poor film that cannot be ignored the acting for the most part is very wooden the only exception is adrien brody's performance as solo's creator bill and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it whilst you where watching the film that said such films are more about the action than the plot acting and as such live or die by the action set pieces that after all is the point of such films to give 14 year olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance and even on this solo fails to deliver what little action there is is poorly done dull and uninspired after seeing the trailer for this on television i was hoping for something along the lines of predator with a robot replacing the instead i got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too watch terminator ii or predator instead both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or to be fair the budget,0
4145,a precursor to citizen kane in its analysis of the life of a just deceased tycoon here reviewed by his faithful secretary in a series of interlocking flashbacks in spencer tracy's 15th film he already looks middle aged even in the scenes where he is meant to be young br br a little silent screen type emoting is understandable given the vintage but this is a most enjoyable well written drama,1
4146,i can't add much to what has been said already except i'm going to have to because of the 10 lines minimum policy br br i've actually got this on a vhs to dvd copy but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released br br i can just imagine what extras i would like to see tim healy's character swearing his way through one of those type programmes would be great you can imagine it now can't you but of course it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release br br surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again oh well,1
4147,i raced to the library to check out this miniseries after having just finished listening to the marvelous talking books unabridged version of the book the first half of this tv version is really very good but it stumbles quite a bit in the second half the relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts are inserted between jean and joe that don't exist in story unwisely in my opinion as they greatly diminish the power of their love story i was disappointed to find that the wonderful bryan brown's joe seemed a lot and much less appealing than the man in the book but helen jean was really quite good i think they would have had to make this a 10 hour miniseries to develop the outback story properly but all that said i did watch whole thing in more or less one go and did appreciate its merits all the while wishing that someone would do a less soapy remake,1

4151,based on a joke once told by jim wynorski that's what i've read at the end of the closing credits well mr wynorski gotta have an awful sense of humour then this film is terrible really i loved the first two chapters of the slumber party massacre series the third film was quite useless but completely watchable compared to this piece of crap there's not even a driller killer and the plot the acting the characters the locations the events everything is boring absurd and laughable the only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls if this film were a porn i think it would have worked really much better the film lacks gore too the first scene the one in the tent could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking at the door lasted one second some moments of slight thrilling can't save a nonexistent plot buzzy lunk johnson seems to be the only real actor here i found him the only bearable character in this movie oh there's a nonsense part with brinke stevens who performed linda in the first slumber party massacre the police bother her to know more details about the killer but what we get is only some footage from the first film not a dialogue neither a monologue or anything from this still traumatized grown up girl who's forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life as she says giving us no clues at all about the murderer br br watch at your own risk,0
4152,seriously if i wanted to make a movie that makes zero sense never will and features lesbian scenes as its only high point i could have br br david lynch is the worst as is this movie anyone could have made a better movie in which at least some answers were given and the story wasn't so slow and long winded the story means nothing without something at the end besides the credits what a waste of time i will never get those 147 minutes of my life back and hope that others can learn from my mistake,0
4153,after searching for 6 months i finally found this dvd all i can say is it was damn well worth the wait rush in rio may very well be the greatest rock dvd in existence i'm not joking it's incredible all the fuss about the sound being crappy is true however it doesn't make the concert unwatchable i find it makes you feel like you're actually in rio watching the concert from the audience that's one of the reasons i love this dvd it makes you feel like you're actually there also geddy alex and neil have never been in better form vocals are flawless alex's guitar playing is still incredible and neil absolutely no words to say the camera work on this concert was very good i must say they gave us a good look at everything that was going on on stage and in the audience kudos to the cameramen anyways enough of my raving go watch rush in rio for yourself you will be amazed i guarantee it br br 10 10,1
4154,anthony wong plays lok a husband whose wife is seriously ill poor lok due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time that's why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring nurses and schoolgirls erotic nightmare is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and voyeurism there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the monk's mystical powers the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy so i'm not complaining of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of diary of a serial killer or red to kill will be disappointed but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look 7 out of 10,1
4155,i didn't really hate mirrormask i just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals the movie begins with a young girl named who works in a circus but while other children supposedly want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away from the circus during a heated argument with her mother wishes she would drop dead bad move the mother gets ill with something presumably cancer and needs surgery on the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming the early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block but a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to cgi land where nearly everything is a computer image the problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have while films like the wizard of oz seemed enticing to explore mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image there's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty the librarian is a masterpiece they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten and her sidekick valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst overall mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash stick to the real world kids,0
4156,this movie has some of the worst production values and editing i've ever seen there are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines actors walking in front of actors who are talking and one point where the film skips about seven frames not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest yet she starts limping oh and what about the secret passageway that is well lit and right out in the open awful br br the plot is non existant something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of caveman war ator pulls out a hang glider at one point in the film's dumbest moment the dialogue is stupid containing such gems as it is everything and nothing and i can feel it here br br the movie is a mess a confusing insipid mess ator is a bland hero the sword fights are absurd and the plot plods along slowly all in all this is a movie to avoid,0
4157,we just saw this movie in austin texas at the alamo south lamar yesterday afternoon it had me laughing out loud many times the scene about albert einstein's thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing it's too bad it's not in more theaters i know a lot of friends that are dieing to see this movie welcome to costco i love you great work to all involved also if you see it make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure if you're a fan of office space and beavis and butthead then you have to go see this movie it's a classic and no one knows that it's out so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend definitely check it out,1
4158,you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother this is the best he can do and sad to say his best just doesn't cut it ice cream man is a very bizarre horror film that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood in the wrong mood it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones so please watch with caution br br clint howard stars does anything really star clint howard though as the evil psychotic bizarre yes all in quotes he's not quite any of these but he's getting close ice cream man who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them ick br br anyway the plot's really just an excuse to show of the well the um well it's a plot oh wait i know it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos there's jan michael vincent and lee majors ii the sequel as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream and even doug appears as a supermarket clerk br br even better than that are some of the bizarre goofs in the film i really like the fact that for some reason instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy fat kid of the group they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes and the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene in which jan michael vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested to bored beyond the state of consciousness these are the cops who also the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck where of course the various bodies and such are kept oh well better luck next time troops br br howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him it's all just plain dumb and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the or gymkata you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor i love that one br br,0

4161,i bought this out of curiosity how did john carradine who died in 1988 and cameron mitchell who died in 1994 make appearances in a film made in 1995 thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years that's how you can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting jack o the curse of ed wood lives on the good thing for both carradine and mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies same goes for scream queens linnea quigley brinke stevens and dawn wildsmith br br the setting is crossing on halloween and some kind of curse is released when dumb beer guzzling teens disrupt a grave the result a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head he it goes after the wholesome kelly family for revenge and kills others who get in his way the father opens a haunted garage for the neighborhood kiddies the son ryan son of the director has one continuous perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave at least he's a kid the mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue there is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue br br so what about the name actors you see stevens wildsmith and mitchell briefly on a tv screen they're used to pad out the time linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter and she does exactly what she can with it her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit there's also one out of nowhere laugh when an ultra conservative couple who watch a rush limbaugh clone on tv bite it the woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife she's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame broiled muppet br br all and all pretty entertaining stuff i wasn't bored,0
4162,i am a fan of a few of the vacation films but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the tv screen you know it's out of steam made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv this movie is another reason br br i think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out but we also had to face the reality it's a tv movie randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead dana barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the griswold kids she is just as pretty but it doesn't help a thin script br br why was this movie even made it was probably because nbc recently picked up another few years of presenting x mas vacation there is nothing wrong with the acting it's all in the script it's just not that funny people need to think before they write stuff like this it is one christmas movie i do not recommend,0
4163,this movie is not worth seeing at least not at a cinema the story is hard to follow and understand it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier it's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad weird that it sometimes seems like it american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual but i think jenny acting as jasmin acts very poor zara acts pretty well she's not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time if you still want to see it wait until it's released on dvd or is shown on tv,0
4164,before i saw this film i read the comment of someone who wasn't very fond of it this i must admit made me apprehensive to dedicate 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life to it but i'm glad i did ryan gosling is a fantastic actor i especially loved the believer don cheadle was also fantastic the film presented an interesting view on life and death it was very touching and very sad yet it kept me interested which most touching stories cannot do it is a film that reckless of whether or not you like it you should see it it was unique and i don t think that anyone will ever be able to duplicate it all of the young actors did surprisingly well given the subject matter and the emotion that must have gone into it i was pleasantly surprised,1
4165,this movie is the funniest danish movie i've ever seen br br the plot is funny surprising and danish humor is unlike any other and it gets you every time the entire audience laughed 90 of the time it was incredible the characters are so well played and the two actors mads and nikolaj lie play their best ever br br i would highly recomend seing this movie you won't regret it believe me,1
4166,without doubt grand champion has the most impressive cast of aaa level stars and musicians ever gathered together for a fun g rated family adventure this is a must buy for every video collection director barry skillfully combines the drama of the rodeo 4h competition for the grand champion cow with a touching and funny story of perseverance against difficult challenges joey lauren adams delivers her typically solid performance as the well intentioned mother but the star of the show is 12 year old emma roberts whose on camera presence is a glowing as that of her famous aunt julia you can expect a lot from this young roberts as is already proving itself in her new hit nickelodeon series,1
4167,i can't believe i rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and i definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'bloody is awful viewing on the contrary i enjoyed it very much and i was pleasantly surprised by the and surprise twists it offers don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers we're introduced to three cherubic looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse at the moment they were delivered planet saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and due to this the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience this really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree br br granted this stuff is incredibility far fetched and even slightly offensive but seriously who cares unlike many other horror films from this period it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative for once the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music the murders sequences are grim and tense and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel faced kids i don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable the bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights such as of the damned' 'the bad and of the damned' this film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this br br bloody birthday was written and directed by ed hunt not particularly the greatest genius in cinema but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like 'the brain' and 'starship if all this isn't enough to convince you yet bloody birthday has a lot of nudity and not just any nudity but a topless dance act by mtv vj julie brown oh and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by joe penny later the star of tv series 'jake and the check it out,1
4168,brought philip larkin to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time and not just the ones that are measured by popularity it shows a stark portrayal of life as the greatest unrecognized poet of his era which is exactly how he would have wanted it such was his disdain for and it dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of philips observations of our relationship with our own mortality and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great philosophers for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life love and death this is a must,1
4169,fame is a very well done portrait of the students who inhabit new york city's high school of the arts the film focuses on a group of students who dream of making it big while they perfect their craft at the now famous school director alan parker allows each of the highlighted students to mature on screen allowing you to feel a connection with each one the music here is infectious and fun the dancing is exciting and fresh the film eventually became the basis for an emmy winning television series starring debbie allen and some of the other actors from the film one of the more enjoyable dance films of the 1980's received oscars for music 8 10,1
4170,if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator requiem is probably not the way to go in summary alien lands in typical american town predator lands in american town both have a bit of a fight us government blows up town some people get away i'm sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending its easy to criticise someone who's being critical people cry out i bet you couldn't do any better i bet i could having made this film watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room,0
4171,first of all i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me and i can safely say that very poor programing and the fact that it's accepted among both genders baffles me it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm poor sarcasm saying bad one liners and well you get the picture also i should mention that i do still watch spongebob which i know i'll get a negative backlash for but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something missing wit the show's about a young girl carly putting on a web show with her friends which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet that's fine but the show's just well not funny at all as previously stated if this is what children's programming has come to today parents show them something that's actually funny spongebob or modern life would work br br also compared to it's show drake josh it's terrible which was implied seriously please watch something worthwhile even for a children's show it's poor,0
4172,this is an excellent film the aerial scenes were well done it was also the right balance of war and love the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few,1
4173,well i had the chance to view this film the other day i didn't know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such but what i did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see br br i wish i could give it this film a 0 rating the first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done the actors didn't have any direction there was no real story i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc but really why should we expose children to this type of film its got poor humor rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80 of its time i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs br br also how can 39 people give this movie a 10 i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company this movie should average at 1 5 10 instead of its current 2 3 10 due to the people that ranked it 10 truly sad,0
4174,i am from texas and live very close to where the actual deaths occurred so i might be a bit biased in saying that wasted is a film that you just can't get out of your head br br stahl phoenix and paul all play their characters very realistically you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts the drug content is handled very graphically as well although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking i definitely recommend this film to anyone once you watch it it sticks with you,1
4175,dirty war is absolutely one of the best political government and well written t v drama's in the 25 years br br the acting is superb the writing is spectacular br br diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear biological and terrorist attack here on american soil br br dirty war should be made into a major motion picture it's that good i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth br br this t v drama reveals how british intelligence mi5 mi6 attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims because of england's involvement in the iraq war br br the scenes of different parts of london england are also spectacular br br dirty war is a must see,1
4176,this game is very good for the n64 you can skate as tony hawk bob steve kareem campell eric andrew reynolds steamer jamie thomas rodney mullen chad muska and maybe some more skaters the game doesn't have mike v or bam dang well anyway the gameplay is awesome the level school ii is a great level with so much to skate in career mode you collect skate get money get high scores and other various things in 2 minutes there's create a skater which is pretty cool i created a skater named butt mulligan a black guy with an afro and a girl board there's park editor some cool premade parks free skate and there's single session where you skate for 2 minutes and get a score you can watch replays which is always cool each skater has 2 styles a and b the graphics aren't that good well they're good for an n64 game i wish i had a controller pack so i could save my data overall this game is awesome i give it an 8 10 for n64 but with the version it's just as fun as the n64 version but kinda hard to control i give it a 7 10 for so go out to a place that still sells n64 games and pick up a copy there's also versions for ps1,1
4177,wow this was a real stinker this early sci fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp there's so much scientific mambo jumbo in the dialog it's laughable the female character played by osa is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boil the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film the special effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie with some good b stars in the lead roles the acting isn't too bad but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge the challenge of not laughing their heads off,0
4178,detective sergent vince de carlo james and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer rapist can psychologist carol susan sullivan help or will she become the killer's next victim and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro br br inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy killer's delight aka the dark ride is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much if anything it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie as much of the violence occurs off camera sure we get mutilated bodies but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department especially considering that they are from the aftermath and not during the crime those hoping for the likes of the toolbox murders or maniac will be very disappointed br br fortunately there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right and is quite suspenseful to boot also john is quite effective as the killer though his hilarious hairstyle white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle is more than a bit distracting br br the dark ride is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation as it lacks the proper exploitation elements and is dated even by the standards of the time those looking for a better example should probably turn to don't go in the house and a few others instead as this just doesn't cut it,0
4179,okay if you discount the production value the ugly outfits and the big hair this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version first ann playing anne elliot is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired amanda root playing the same role in the 90's version can express more in her big brown eyes than can with her entire face in a four hour production anne is turned into a peevish whining boring character and what was with the scene during the long where she stops to spout off poetry henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other henrietta was taller and louisa never was there a more obnoxious character it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard when she starts to chant to to to ' i started yelling shut up shut up shut up ' the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie speaking of the fall at the cobb scene it was the poorly acted badly directed and edited scene of the entire film how does a person fall three feet down land on her feet and still be knocked unconscious br br on the plus size the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end br br i'll admit i have bought this movie even though i knew how sub par it was but i'm a huge austen fan so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels watch this move if you're morbidly curious or to appreciate the 90's version even more br br the bottom line is this version may follow the letter of the novel but the 90's version follows the spirit,0
4180,i agree with the comments regarding the downward spin the last view shows have been a little better but surely the writers need some more direction i think the characters are still interesting although sometimes they spin into the white trash things a little too much subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like office i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and lineup one would think that karma and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows but they only scratch the surface of the subject in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses we can handle more heady content it has been proved before in many other shows,0
4181,i first watched this movie in istanbul film festival back in 1994 it was so good i took couple of friends with me and went to see it again the same week the characters are very well played and the humor here and there is amazing it sure is a very powerful gay movie some scenes make you feel you're watching an episode of friends with much more sophisticated lines i guess i'll put it in my vcr and watch it again tonight,1
4182,this has got to be the worst horror movie i have ever seen br br i hated it so much i wanted to come here and complain about how bad it was normally bad movies are no big deal but something about this one if you hated it you really hate it br br if anyone liked this you probably enjoyed baby geniuses i thought i could never find a movie that was worse then that one i guess not,0
4183,like most sports movies it's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it as a soccer referee i have yet to see a movie or tv show get it right when depicting a match forever has good actors but i found sean astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail i was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on flagstaff as well as highland which gets to credulity a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the flagstaff baddies are hazing rick penning even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally the team is a school based club sport much like rodeo that said i find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds that just isn't done in this day of aids and hepatitis i don't care what the tradition and macho image is despite that it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults and sometimes actually did sadly far too many coaches are like or worse,1
4184,i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted for this this is not an artistic movie it is mormon propaganda nothing wrong with that but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading if you are a bible thumping christian or a mormon watch this movie you'll love it and think it is truly amazing for anyone else don't bother the story is so contrived random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor are you kidding what a pussy anyways this is an awful movie,0
4185,the problem with this and with all vietnam war films is that they're all too biased antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u s soldiers were heroes while films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie this film sucks it's time for a movie that is neither nor antiwar nor liberal nor conservative but completely unbiased,0
4186,if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience than this awful motion picture if you may consider to call it that is for you a film worse than the postman sizzle beach u s a batman and robin kazaam fair game well you get my point this film directed by french television sensation patrick sebastien jerry springer with an i q of 25 can truly be considered the worst film ever made i do hope that troma or someone in america would distribute it so that the u s a can experience the french stench at it's worth,0
4187,i saw this movie as a child and i am longing to see it again has it survived i discount the 1980 version entirely as being fluff i am sure that there are many that don't feel it is necessary to preserve these films it is so unfortunate to discover a lost gem after it is gone young people today don't realize the hallucinatory quality and the impact on one's life a film seen in early youth can have in later life this film the blue lagoon had that effect on me how many of us have wished to find ourselves in a place removed of the fears and chaos of the modern world this was an idyllic story of a boy and girl castaway on a tropical island there are troubles to be sure but in the end they fall in love and the have a baby life should be so simple and beautiful,1
4188,from the creators of bruce almighty and liar liar the film took a while to pick up from the start at least for me seeing as i expected this was a run along america pie flick but it was slightly different a fun loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his own college running it accordingly as you can expect there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick bartleby gaines justin long encourages his students peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately it to the system ' the humour was varied which i loved all the cast delivered fantastic performances hire this one out with a friend it's a bloody crack up,1
4189,frank clint eastwood is a secret service agent plagued with guilt over the assassination of president john f kennedy while he was on duty thirty years later and the current president is entering a re election campaign but he is receiving death threats and has been called in to assist in what should be a routine research operation john malkovich plays the professional assassin and master of disguise who is tracking the president and using the past he begins to torture in a psychological duel of cat and mouse br br malkovich eastwood and rene russo all give wonderful performances in this top notch thriller the direction is excellent and the entire picture is charged with tension and intrigue throughout br br a must see for thriller fans 8 10,1
4190,iron eagle has always been one of my films for a long time now it looks like but with a different plot and a lot of people will disagree with me here in my view it's better than br br this film has some amazing dogfight scenes when the fighter jets are zooming through the air it also has the queen song one vision thumping in the background which in my opinion is a fantastic song br br to be honest iron eagle was very good but it's sequels were rubbish br br,1
4191,it must be remembered that the gammera movies like many of the first series gozilla films were in fact aimed squarely at kids little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience they get to run around and play with top secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it they get to cavort with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real danger br br perhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment br br as one critic said these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies,0
4192,if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world i am convinced a son without a name takes care of his mother without a name they love each other i guess no they don't i'm sure these aren't characters they aren't even actors playing characters at least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage 1 10,0
4193,i really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions and i even liked the wade quinn tension in early episodes some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories however as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond there was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension and every world had one of the characters falling in love the writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends a la star wars traveling to different dimensions on tv for several years rather than a tired band of knit pickers,0
4194,russell t davies has been tasked with re creating a slice of my childhood hiding behind the sofa watching scary monsters battle with dr who he and his crew are clearly all true devotees of the original series br br in much the same way as the star trek movies used their budget to make the gene original concept far more believable russell t davies has both money and the advantages of excellent cgi to create the best monsters ever i am sure that this series was made with a budget that anticipated both export and dvd sales and it really feels as if no expense was spared br br the accompanying series dr who confidential shows the work that goes into each episode which is a really useful behind the scenes insight interviews with the cast and writers help retell the story from each characters perspective and are far more useful than simply watching the whole programme over again br br how does david tenant rank in the pantheon of his illustrious predecessors time will tell but tonight seeing billie piper play alongside elisabeth who was the doctor's companion in the 1970's confirm that she has both the acting ability screen presence and script to be the no 1,1
4195,i was expecting to this to be hilarious and it was mediocre at best the only funny character is believe it or not andy dick the timing was just horrible on most of the jokes gags and the writing was bad i mean i know its supposed to be like blaxploitation but it just did work besides this whole genre has been beaten to death already with all the austin powers movies undercover brother it just seems old it also just feels like a rip off from undercover brother which also wasn't hysterical but a lot funnier than this also for an comedy action movie the direction was kind of bland i don't know if this is going to be released in theaters but it definatley is made for tv,0
4196,ru paul plays a secret agent called she teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil manners and get her kidnapped niece back or something like that seriously i had trouble concentrating on the plot the movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe add quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything the dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible the acting is actually pretty ok except for ru paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny after 30 minutes i had to leave because i was bored sick and just couldn't stand it anymore i pride myself on sitting through anything but this went way beyond my limits people are comparing this to the early work of john waters i disagree waters' work is sick but good this is just sick avoid,0
4197,i'm sorry fans but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles it's decent music wise but the presentation is simply boring big time most of the songs sound the same and lead singer writer jeff lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin he has a pleasant voice but he isn't much to watch he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes the songs all sound like 1970s 1980s bubblegum stuff pleasant but not exciting br br lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman rosie but she isn't too animated either the only song out of 23 that creates any excitement is the last one roll over beethoven now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them this could have been a much better concert dvd,0
4198,i don't know about the english version of this movie but the norwegian translation is the funniest movie i've seen in many years the characters say so many funny things and make so many weird references to current events that i'm amazed they kept having more options like the architect who can never say the name of the wizard correctly it becomes things like malcom i x and which is norwegian for foreign affairs br br like the word many of the translations does not give any meaning in english and probably not in french either so the translators must have made up their own jokes and done so very well of course they have a very good base to build on with a film that's simply comical from beginning to end br br recommended in all languages with a good translation,1
4199,i think that this is a fabulous movie i watched it constantly from the time i was 4 to about the time i was 8 however watching it resulted in many nightmares i particularly got them because of the guy that was always like the and his friends i am 12 and i still get nightmares about it to this day i can't fall asleep right now because i am thinking about it i love this movie but it is so scary i definitely love this movie though i have very good memories from it kate is very good at acting in this movie amazingly i never realized that it was her i also think that the graphics were very high quality contrary to what some other people think,1
4200,begotten is certainly an experience and a out of the ordinary experience at that the use of colour is fascinating and at times frustrating a lot of what happens on screen is incredibly difficult to make out your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in colour and tone characters in the way and random cuts to the sky the sound is very haunting and a welcome addition it really aids the nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film br br as for what begotten is about the rape of the environment and rebirth theory feels pretty accurate to me but i wouldn't spend a lot of time focusing on the meaning it's virtually unimportant it's clear the director didn't want to explain anything he simply presents it as it is and if you want to search for a meaning that's up to you br br watching begotten is definitely not a walk in the park but i was captivated from the opening it really is like watching a person's worst nightmare what we see is at times distressing and very unpleasant but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty in there if you're an art house experimental fan and you haven't yet seen begotten make it a priority i doubt you will ever forget it i sure know that i won't,1
4201,even for sci fi this movie is movie is a little out there alright more than a little my first thought after watching it was that i had just lost my mind br br don't watch this movie expecting another darko darko fans are never going to like another richard kelly movie because of their freaky cult standards donnie darko is a thing of the past get over it br br richard kelly loves making movies that make you feel stupid for not understanding the meaning' the first time you watch them to be honest i had to watch the box twice before i liked it br br the deeper meaning to spare you a bunch of sociological psycho babble humans are self serving we make decisions that can destroy our lives and don't open mail without a return address br br summary creepy old man tells diaz if you push the button i will kill someone you don't know and give you a million bucks of course she pushes it and as promised by the creepy old gets a case of money then the movie takes a dive into the unusual to spare my fingers the typing for pushing the button diaz and her husband are cursed by supernatural alien beings in an elaborate experiment to gage the morality of the human race br br i liked the willingness of the movie to ignore the generic movie guidelines its different its intense it has a deeper meaning although its philosophy 101 material it leaves you guessing not a hollywood ending br br i disliked why would any being with the technology to inhibit another life form devise such a ridiculous scheme what god like alien has the patience for that diaz was good but was there a need for the country accent they live in virginia br br i give it a 7 because kelly didn't put as much attention to detail as with his other movies overall good flick,1
4202,this is one of the best sequels around and a very good movie too even there were some mistakes but still i enjoyed it this time charles is not just fighting one or two muggers but a whole army of them death wish 3 has a lot great action scenes and i enjoyed it every single second of it director michael winner knows how to direct a good action movie like this and jimmy page providing the music with producers golan and globus still doing there thing and charles bronson is still acting good for paul this movie also made it look like that michael try to end the death wish series and i can't blame him and i love the gun that charles uses death wish 3 is one of the great movies of 1985 and can't get any better than this br br i gives this 9 10,1
4203,let me just say that granny was extremely well made with the horror violence and sure suspense moves the best indie horror movie i have ever seen that is only 58 minutes long it is my 5 out of 20 most favorite movie of all time you people should love this i give it a 10 out of 10,1
4204,like another reviewer i really wanted to like this movie i went with my father who was the biggest lover and booster of classical music but neither of us could stand this movie i wouldn't even call it a movie a better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces as i recall the camera never even moved rather i just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece the only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little lapping at a beach i'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake and again using a stationary camera truly pathetic i can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five when we walked out my father and i were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie i don't know of of any good movies about bach the world really does need one but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one someone will make one someday until then just keep rewatching amadeus,0
4205,this movie should be retitled sex in the 70s in a part of new york city called greenwich village and chelsea br br this movie does little to talk about sex in the 70s except focus on the environments of public and private sex spaces in new york city i doubt that the manhole bar was symbolic of actual sex in the 70s and that kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film br br don't get me wrong the time period looks like a blast and it's rather important to document the scene to which the film refers but as far as calling this film sex in the 70s the title is a bit misleading technically it's no oscar nominee but the rawness of it feels appropriate for the subject br br overall an eh,0
4206,my friend and i rented this one a few nights ago and i must say this is the single best movie i have ever seen i mean woah dude we better get some brew before this joint closes and dude linda's not a bra again what poetry woah and it's such a original movie too i mean you don't usually find a slasher film where every single murder is exactly the same i mean exactly now that's originality and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great close ups of the psycho in the er scrubs how cool the acting is so wonderful to the dad was just brilliant must have studied real dads before filming and how many movies do you find that just don't make any sense not many but this is one of those gems i mean how cool is it that one guy waited outside for like six hours to pull a prank while his friends were both inside that's really cool overall i'd say this is the single greatest film of the genre nay in the world,0
4207,i wonder how someone could diss on this movie it is based on an actual story it is not necessarily about rugby itself so to the one that posted on here that they need to make a real rugby movie you missed the point this is not another typical sports movie where a team sucks they hire emilio estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies it focuses on a story it shows how someone can change his or her life for the better the movies now days are all about sex drugs partying etc that is hollywood i am a big fan of movies but i have to say this was an inspirational movie with a great message if you consider yourself a tough guy don't watch the movie it won't live up to your standards if you want to watch a good inspirational movie this is a good one,1
4208,please why not put this fantastic film on dvd i have been searching just like the previous writer for years whats the hold up or show it on tv its so underestimated its one of the most romantic and beautifully written books i have ever read and believe i have read some i seem to think it was read on radio 4 but i can't find that either why not try and remake it even i promise it will be top earner people love those sorts of stories so please either release it and take us out of our misery or remake it although i doubt if it could be improved upon has any one read gone to earth by the same author or seen the film with jennifer jones this is superb but not to the same extent may be,1

4211,ah the sci fi channel how often do you disappoint me quite often i think do you ever show good movies ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say bad acting bad directing terrible characters and a shallow story and that is just for starters i checked out the director allan a and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name the premises of four motor bikers out motto crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens leading man bryan the park ranger is so bad it is terrible cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew avoid at all costs,0
4212,po like many films of is perhaps not understandable for the rest of the world story based on the few short stories of who during wwii was the prisoner of dachau and camps in his books describes inhuman life in the nazi camps from the point of view porte parole of author who also was on the privileged position among the prisoners was merciless for the humanity and merciless for himself he describes the human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation ironically after the returning to poland he stopped writing artistic prose and became communistic propagandist producing stream of anti and anti american press publications after few years he committed suicide in the movie changes point of view character created by the plays only supporting role story is focused on the poet destroyed burned out by the war and and his one day love affair with nina jewish girl who escaped from communistic poland although she actually hates jewish life and mentality as the background we can observe sad grotesque of so called displaced persons life who after the liberation are settled by the americans in ss barracks marches patriotic kitsch mixed with hunting for the extra dose of food and or prostituting german girls br br,1
4213,just saw this movie on opening night i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it i must say i was not impressed i'm so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money br br first of all the is very predictable and just not much of a thriller it might be scary for someone under 13 but it really did nothing for me the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution br br furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes br br if you've seen previews for this movie then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters,0

4215,it only took one viewing of this dog for me to say never again it's so profoundly unmemorable that i had to read other people's reactions to it before i could remember anything beyond 1 it was awful 2 connery should have quit while he was ahead and 3 the film included a total gross out bit involving faking a scan through the most gruesome not to mention horribly inefficient means possible br br actually i've never understood why anybody would prefer even the best of connery's bond films over even the worst moore or dalton outings or brosnan or even david niven for that matter i personally found octopussy and moonraker among other canonical bond films to be far more entertaining than this and probably for the very same reasons why others the moore bond films namely their wry humor and their willingness to surrender to the of the whole basic bond milieu,0

4224,this is one of the funniest shows on tv today it hits the mark 99 of the time usually after watching a sitcom after a few years the actors become to cartoonish as if they are trying to become the beloved characters they play these actors have in my opinion stayed true to their roles the chemistry is still there the writing has not gone down and i still look forward to watching it the family dynamic still seems real and the situations after all this time are not so far fetched to make it seem the writers are reaching into an empty bag trying to keep the show on for one more season it is one of the few shows i watch without the remote in my hand for quick switching,1

4227,though this film doesn't stand out particularly from the movie crowd its still a very nice film to sit down and watch with your feet up there maybe the odd one or two mistakes you catch and the cinematic are a little slipshod the film itself is very enjoyable and has a wonderful atmosphere to it the music contributes a lot to the mood of the movie br br the acting is none the less impressive especially the dog he he with john travolta taking the lead of the fun troublesome loving michael other characters feel very genuine and perform very well within the film br br so after a long day at work stick michael on in the evening with some ice cream and enjoy a very quality film in its own right,1
4228,i'd buy that for a dollar br br i did buy this film for a dollar and i've seen much worse for much more br br this is a scottish sci fi film from mark and according to the making of hysterical by the way the production only cost 8000 eight grand that wouldn't pay for half a minute in hollywood nevertheless this is top fun film making if you like things gritty then you're in for a treat these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing i didn't mind but my girl friend did the actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that i've never heard of or seen before it meant i had no idea who was going to die first br br if you watch a movie for it's of the visual effects then watch a star wars the effects here are ok but kinda weak in space but the monsters are very well done if a bit like br br does an amazing job with not very much and i'd love to see his take on a real hollywood movie it least it wasn't predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off ok so it is a little derivative of other sci fi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci fi film for 8 g's is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry br br good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting making of no standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in mancha only with a film at the end but why no commentary keep going scots,1

4233,some time ago i saw this when hbo was showing it and from what i saw of it it seemed like a good movie so i'm in blockbuster today and i see it there with the dvd's and i decide what the hell so i rent it after i finished watching it i was in shock of how good it was br br this movie just touched my heart everything in it was so amazing the stories the actors the dark humor the music oh don't get me started on the music in this film pt is one of the greats definitely the best thing to come out since quentin tarantino a god br br after i finished the first viewing i watched it again with anderson's commentary i was suprised on how such a cool guy he is br br anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie if they haven't already anderson is obviously a film lover in the movie he rips off so many other directors such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water obviously ripped off from i am cuba but i have no beef what so ever with that the film is very respectable with it's br br i recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film porn br br 10 10,1
4234,stan laurel it's been noted first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s he certainly demonstrates himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer here in mud and sand a parody of rudolph blood and sand but i think a film like this really works not because laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it i watched this the day after watching blood and sand itself it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being parodied and where br br the scene where laurel's character vaseline if you believe the title cards or if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board his mother out of money with a two for you two for me trick is funny on its own because it's a great gag but it's extra funny if the viewer is aware how it is taking the air out of extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desires br br this is the best stan laurel solo work i've seen it's just plain funny even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material,1
4235,i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies i've seen in my life but to say that it was one of the worst movies i've ever viewed would be putting it lightly i'm wondering if there isn't some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced i mean the financing had to come from somewhere someone had to put up money for this to be produced br br i'd pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film but this film violated every production standard in the universe i couldn't make it thru the entire movie as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques i also can't tell you how many scenes i just ended off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialog br br i feel like i've been permanently scarred for life if you viewed this movie before getting this warning you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity,0
4236,this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans you think manos is the worst movie ever it doesn't even come close to this garbage i dont even know where to begin the russian commander and the rebel chic are the worst actors ever to appear in a movie they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep the goofy faces the chic makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed then there is the music during the prison break the totally out of place love scene the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene the fake castro the fact that everybody has either a headband and or a on some part of their body the goofiest rape scene ever filmed and the worst acting ever put on film this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans definitely the worst movie ever made,0
4237,to understand crash course in the right context you must understand the 80's in tv most tv shows didn't have any point the sitcom the drama at least 3 to 1 they were still figuring out where the lines were so that they could cross them tv shows like hail to the chief was quite the bold step this made for tv movie crash course featured an all star cast bringing together members from all the 80's classics 227 family ties who's the boss et al directors must've had a certain penchant for those all star movies then still this movie offered very light fare and a simplistic view of heroism and maturity and that's not bad sometimes viva soleil moon frye,1
4238,every once in a while an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't miss but the movie sucks some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are levity and the safety of objects and now here's the united states of leland br br said awesome cast includes ryan gosling kevin spacey don cheadle jena malone lena olin michelle williams chris klein and kerry washington gosling plays leland p fitzgerald the teenage son of a famous author spacey who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime murdering a retarded child but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive br br don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland and also exploit him by writing a book about him and jena malone is his ex girlfriend we see their deteriorating relationship due to her heroin addiction in flashback sounds like an awesome little drama huh i thought so too br br the fact is that this movie is just badly badly written the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about life the characters are all two dimensional indie cliches and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways it glosses over his crime br br for the most part there's no problem with the acting gosling who was oscar worthy in the believer is a tremendously talented young actor but the way they're written none of these characters least of all leland even feel like real people so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad br br jena malone is the most memorable she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this she can break your heart with one look when she's got good material to work with as in donnie darko or the dangerous lives of altar boys she's really amazing br br but this is not good material maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile but as it is the united states of leland is ponderous inert and for a movie that seems in love with how deep it is it's really shallow,0
4239,about the discussion on the south the rednecks and the hillbillies well i am from the south argentina near the south pole to be exact is this southern enough seriously some stories are universal we have never been to greece nor lived the classic period of homer but he speaks to us today so does shakespeare and dante and stories from far unknown places also reach us when told with sensibility intelligence humor just like o brother besides we all the rest of the world have our own hillbillies too and our own depression era ever heard of argentina during year 2001 our politicians and racism our gentle souls just like delmar and tommy i simply loved this movie folks despite the subtitles despite being on the other side of the world and please forgive my errors in english i tried my best br br ps i believe nobody quoted this favorite phrase when delmar asks george nelson what does he do for a living while handling him the machine gun,1

4241,the best way to have fun in this movie is to count how many clichés it is rehashing snarling chinese gangsters a female vice president a duct that happens to be big enough to fit a big caucasian male shooting through the wall to kill the bad guy a situation where you need to snuff out some innocent people to prevent armageddon independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball the vice president in a nice well lighted room surrounded by subordinates while the chinese premier virtually alone in a dark room with just bit of dim light shining snarling as viciously as the slimy gangsters a lone hero left alone in a ship building airplane whatever wreaking havoc on clueless bad guys with big automatic weapons etc etc etc br br the second best way is to count how many zeroes you need to put after the decimal to accurately gauge the probability of the film scenario i counted up to 45 a president agreeing to a meeting on board a private vessel the impossibly non command from the nuke box the part where the chinese decided to play shoot 'em up etc etc man the earth is more likely fall into the sun than for this film to happen br br i admit the film was interesting until the point the evil taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president then the boredom kicked in suspension of disbelief ceased and i started thinking the fun i'd have torturing this film,0
4242,i first saw this movie at a video store and being the bam fan i am had to rent it to see what it was all about since i have a huge and stupid note the word stupid sense of humor i found this movie absolutely hilarious some of the parts are pointless and random but that's what makes them so amusing you'll need to think things like getting slapped in the face and bashed on the head with a watermelon are funny in order to appreciate this movie i was really impressed br br i was also surprised at the acting these people actually did a good job nothing oscar worthy but well enough to get past the amateur level teens and young adults would probably find this more entertaining because of the modern slang and situations used i wouldn't suggest watching this with your parents and vice versa br br all in all the acting was great the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to,1
4243,directed by jim wynorski chopping mall return of the swamp thing cheerleader massacre is the fourth installment in the slumber party massacre series just think about it it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that no one really cares about so how could this even be good well it's not but since when did slasher films have to be good cheerleader massacre is entertaining that's for sure but in the entertainment field we've seen better that's for sure too as you can see i'm not sure about where i stand concerning this movie those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied this movie's all boobs but unfortunately no blood or not enough i think i'm being generous with this movie because i had a good time watching it and i really enjoy watching slasher movies even as bad as they sometimes are if you want me to be sincere the slumber party massacre part 1 is the best one and all the others are a waste of time so i guess i have a lot of time to waste for more fun watch sleepaway camp 2 and cheerleader camp,0
4244,this movie appears to have been overlooked by everyone someone should bring it out on vhs and dvd it is an excellent film and far superior to the one with brooke shields which was terrible br br jean simmons deserves more credit than she is getting now days it would be nice if all her films were offered on vhs or dvd jean simmons was and still is a very good actress she certainly was a beauty in fact she is still a beauty she also has done extremely well on t v she is so much better than many of the actors today,1
4245,lonely among us definitely is one of the best first season episodes the storyline although somewhat confusing creates a lot of suspense supported by the creepy synthesizer driven soundtrack this is a typically alien body invasion scenario but finally turning out to no evil purpose the death of assistant chief engineer singh to me was an accident the two delegate species deliver an entertaining frame best make up so far finally adding a little black humor to the series the final scene patrick stewart obviously enjoys stepping out a bit of his picard character and exploring some new terrain as does data by posing as sherlock holmes another all time classic the special effects are also convincing and director cliff bole did his job well he is the first one trying to compensate trois lack in acting ability by improving her looks she does look beautiful in some scenes and the neck of her dress improves her appearance a lot picard's lightning scene on the bridge gives him a slight air of the emperor of star wars return of the jedi which is a personal impression but made me smile br br there's also some playing with the lighting of the corridors simulating night aboard and the first moving camera pulling back from picard when he's entering the transporter room to beam into the cloud nice work the clever cutting creating continuing dialog through different scenes troi's hypnosis report rounds up the impression of a really well crafted tng episode the first one where even wesley crusher seemed almost tolerable br br the ending however is a bit confusing just as if the producers were running out of time p for picard is a little far fetched and his return far too easy but that can be left aside regarding the many strong moments this episode has to offer,1

4247,ok now at first i thought this was going to be another cheesy romantic comedy which held back on the comedy but this wasn't i mean how could it have been with the fabulous amanda bynes staring in it she was amazing really funny is still stunning the boys in it were also extremely fit one major reason for going girls the plot is strongly based upon the shakespeare play night' as it was extremely similar there was even a spider called which belonged to the like character the script was really well written and pulled together and it was very witty the football skills in it were also amazing it even made me think of playing football myself anyway to sum it up this is a light hearted film about young romance which gets very confusing go and see it,1
4248,i just saw it at an advance screening i haven't read the book but heard many good things about it br br the movie was absolutely fantastic very moving with a roller coaster of emotions you totally connect with the characters shaun was great it was a complete departure from his usual roles and his acting for those who understand persian dari was incredible br br one thing to notes it that actually loved the film which is unusual for book adaptation movies even after seeing the movie several times he was sobbing br br also the animation from the intro was exquisite with names displayed as if it were persian calligraphy very unique at times the translation was not clearly conveying the message efficiently but all in all this was a great movie,1
4249,for all losers who gave it negative review its because you probably have sex once in 2 years or you are in ltr with one girl for years and guess what she is going to cheat on you when player like those on that show approach her somewhere off course any male who is not as good as these guys are going to hate them and hate the show and that one chick who thinks this show is meant to mock these guys its more actually how to show clueless man how to pick up woman what these guys are doing it way better then what most man are doing not approaching at all for anybody who has open mind i recommend to read the book the game by neil strauss it deals with similar theme as this show,1
4250,blew my mind the first time i saw it and it's held up quite well over the years the sets and monster effects work are some of the best i've ever seen nobody i know seems to have seen this film which i believe tanked at the box office because of the lack of interest in horror in the early nineties it plays like a dark horrific fairy tale and is a lot deeper then you'd think with a strong message against bigotry presented by a rich mystical past that clive barker created what sucks is the film ends on a really cool sequel note that we'll probably never see my only minor gripe is that craig sheffer is only a passable actor at best and the the project might have benefited with a better actor in the part just a minor complaint though as sheffer does alright i had a similar issue with scott bakula in barker's lord of illusions not really a terrible performance but i just didn't like him in the role as much as i would have other people,1
4251,i heard they were going to remake this french classic in 2007 and i see it is in development for this will be a shame as hollywood kicked writer director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist they should not have the right to remake any of his films br br i love caper films and film noir and this combines the best of both br br tony jean gets out after doing a and after he beats up his old girlfriend marie he plans a big score with his friends mario robert manuel and jo carl what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers nothing is left to chance br br the caper goes off great but marcel sends his sons robert hossein and pierre after tony and the gang after blowing it with mario they kidnap jo's son lots of bullets fly before it is over br br a great film by a great director the standard by which other caper films are measured,1
4252,formulaic to the max neither title reflects the serial's actual content fighting nazis in morocco actually the ranch the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights the packaging claims over 40 in 15 chapters that's at least three a chapter aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman watching how much furniture is overturned smashed thrown burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about when the protagonists start fighting you can bet that everything in the room will be in it too so kudos to the fight choreographer who is the real star of this serial br br two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights and best of all we have the girl side kick often a journalist as she is here actually participating in the mayhem mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in manhunt of mystery island 1945 on the negative side there are just too many jump out of the way escapes before the slab falls before the car goes over the cliff before the speedboat explodes before the building explodes before the truck hits you etc etc br br it is claimed that this serial partially george lucas to make the first indiana jones film but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development br br rod cameron as a moving rock a role he played in all his films other than watching all the furniture getting smashed there's nothing really going on here compared to other serials that have fewer fights more story better actors and more developed characters br br i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing,0
4253,if you enjoy sitting in the dark both literally and figuratively for ninety minutes then this is the movie for you br br a waste of actors resources and audience time ultimately a waste of space don't be tempted by the resume there is nothing of any further substance beyond it the film lacks all of the basics that you might expect from the genre plot character development denouement the cast may perhaps take heart from the knowledge that in this instance their efforts will be entirely forgettable and given time their careers may perhaps improve br br absolute tripe,0
4254,oddly enough the independent film channel showed this film a week after it showed karate bear fighter even though the bear film was the second in the trilogy and this film was the first what were they thinking while all three of these films are supposedly based on the life of this great karate master you can't help but think that they must have embellished the story quite a bit especially in this first film sure the guy evidently did fight and kill a bull and later a bear in fact he fought and killed many bulls during his career but in this film set in the early 50s at the end of the film the hero actually fights about 60 guys and kills many of them brutally i just can't imagine that this really occurred so i did some checking and found that while many of the details are correct some of this film is pure bunk yes he did kill a man in self defense and yes he did follow the widow and her son and spent a year working for them trying to get them to forgive him but the end of the film is great to watch but hogwash seeing one of his opponents get a staff thrust through his head and all the other gory details couldn't have happened or else the japanese government would have locked oyama up to protect society the film is entertaining and the fighting is excellent there are no complaints about the action or acting the only minor complaint is the camera work which is a tad sloppy during some of the fight scenes despite this minor complaint this is a most enjoyable film in many ways the wandering karate master theme is pretty reminiscent of the zatoichi films which are also lots of fun to watch but many of the exploits are truly impossible br br fyi there is an dubbed version of this film entitled champion of death and i just saw it as well it's not a bad dubbing and it was letter boxed a big plus but still i prefer the subtitled version,1
4255,the most disturbing thing about this film is not that it's a load of hogwash the was never really as much an espionage threat as the movie makes out the troubling aspect is the way that it the wholly unsavory tactics of the fbi and the unamerican activities committee secret informants gossip turned into accusations searches these are the kind of things secret police thugs like the kgb did and presumably what the good patriotic americans were fighting yet the fbi did them and didn't bat an eye that's the only realistic part of this movie and they present it with no sense of shame at all add to this undermining the constitution itself by having only communists invoke the bill of rights the film also makes thinly veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was communist inspired another pack of lies it's extremely difficult in this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda even understanding the paranoia of the times when one realizes how damaging it was to real people then,0
4256,frankie plays jason who is a high school student his biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times however he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline while he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher he crushes into a car as he explains the situation to grumpy man giamatti in the car he gives him a lift to his school but the problem is jason leaves his homework in the car the other way of saying this is marty wolf giamatti steals it br br after a few months jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback because the story of the movie is based on his homework he tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him especially his father uses words which insults him jason decides to go to la and find wolf to tell his father that jason is not a liar when wolf refuses it jason takes action and ruins his life br br this is the short story of the big fat liar well as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible such as having such a small amount of money and going to la with a friend to sort the problem out having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office setting up a telecommunications system overnight does it seem believable it does not well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible br br big fat liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience unfortunately i am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie out of,0

4258,tamara just felt like another teen oriented knock off of the i know what you did last summer trend and is painfully dull a high school outcast who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods vowing to tell no one the next day the supposedly dead tamara arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would be killers and has a little revenge this is basically a combination of carrie the craft and every other straight to video teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers there is some gore which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out otherwise don't bother,0
4259,i first watched this movie back in the mid late 80's when i was a kid we couldn't even get all the way through it the dialog the acting everything about it was just beyond lame br br here are a few examples imagine these spoken real dramatically way over acted you're going to why would anyone want to go to br br nobody ever told us about any br br this movie was so bad my sister and i rented it again for her 16th birthday party just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was i don't think we were able to finish it then either,0
4260,the merchant of four seasons was rainer werner fassbinder's first shot at mainstream acceptance in a turbulent career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer the storyline is fairly straightforward a man is ostracized from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his downward spiral the merchant of four seasons is shot with a slavish devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed every object on set seems painstakingly arranged so as to provoke layers of emotional texture many religious paintings and icons decorate the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama several times during the film i froze the frame to marvel at the beauty of the shot's composition i streamed this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none fassbinder employs his actors in an almost vehement anti style he does everything possible to prevent the actors from reacting in a normal or colloquial manner and this creates a rather stilted effect however by doing so he injects an almost reality' to the narrative rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost militant lack of affectation forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner fassbinder's film intentionally prevents the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and tribulations you are constantly on the outside looking in this will be a disconcerting experience for many but i found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure,1
4261,spiderman was one of the first comic books to initiate a change in the genre in spite of being a very well made superhero comic book this is the first series ever that added a real psychological depth to the main character had complex moral issue round characters and also highlighted social and political issues in other words spiderman was the comic book's coming of age this tv series lacks all of those components it's just a straightforward good buy bad guy tv series suffering from obvious budgetary that make the action scene moderately exciting spiderman is about as convincing as the cardboard rocks in star trek nicholas hammond is way too old for the role at that point in time i think he was well into his thirties wheras spider man was really teenager at the time for some unfathomable reason the writers also changed names and deleted important characters from the comic book which again just resulted in the tension between characters basically disappearing,0
4262,bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer this fact becomes apparent in en i where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep yet very emotional scenes this movie is paves the way for bergman's later comedies and all of them starring gunnar as well as eva this is an excellent movie with which to start your bergman experience acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old the cinematography by martin is astounding for instance in the picnic scene in short the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy with a clarity of depth even surpassing some of bergman's own comedies,1
4263,first of all i'd like to start by saying it's a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable br br patrick stewart does the role justice as ian hood the government science adviser with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of real world science and how he feels it's either being used or abused by others br br not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the series but it makes it's characters seem more believable than most other british drama's br br ashley jensen also delivers a first rate performance as dr hood's appointed bodyguard rachael young she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific uninterested everyday views of science and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them br br the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows br br there are however notable disappointments with the series every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn't seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open ended stories br br although bearing in mind that this is still the first series i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve br br for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point,1
4264,it has been since 1972 that i saw this movie and i still remember it as one of my favorite all time movies i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it isn't you would think that anything starring peter sellers would be brought back much better than being there and as good as the pink panther series uschi digard had a small part for such a well endowed performer she is bonus in this movie i think the medical field may not appreciate this film as it really makes fun of the profession and it also makes one appreciate that sellers was never available to treat them as his bed side manner sucked as well did his analysis of urine samples,1
4265,sorry folks this is without a doubt the worst film i have ever seen sometimes when a movie is really bad you can joke about it and have a good laugh like plan 9 from outer space this movie is so bad you can´t even enjoy it on an ironic level,0
4266,why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it it can't be that bad surely firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project yawn and does so very poorly so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a simpson's halloween special would be far scarier but if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general crapness of this film would suffice but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing the best bit its only about an hour and a half thank god,0
4267,this is one of several period sea faring yarns of its era which has the added distinction although not in itself unique of a female buccaneer at its center at first both leads – jean peters and louis – might seem miscast but they grow nicely into their roles eventually thanks no doubt to the talented players herbert marshall thomas gomez and james robertson justice who support them velvety voiced marshall is uncharacteristically cast as the obligatory philosophical lush of a doctor and gomez is suitably larger than life as the pirate br br the cast is completed by debra paget as wife who incurs the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in whom instills the first pangs of love which however does not spare him the occasional flogging or sword wound incidentally the film was the second exotic teaming of and paget in one year following delmer bird of paradise the direct result of this unexpected softening of character is her falling out with crew and her unlikely climactic sacrifice in order to save the lives of the stranded paget and marshall br br while the film is not a particularly outstanding example of its type jacques energetic direction and franz grandiose score ensure an above average effort that moves along at a brisk pace incidentally tourneur had already done service in the genre with the superior burt lancaster vehicle the flame and the arrow 1950 as usual with vintage technicolor productions the cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating by the way differing running times are given for this film 81 or 87 minutes and for the record the version i watched was the shorter one,1
4268,one of his lesser known films many horror fans have yet to catch this dario argento offering which is unfortunate it is underappreciated mostly because of the fact that really not enough people have seen it the film boasts grade a argento gore with his customary close ups set to savage rock scores while it true that this script is not very complex it is not nearly as bad as other entries in its genre or his own personal resume for that matter br br this movie symbolizes more of the that he likes to portray in his films by his own admission worth a good look on any night,1
4269,when i rented this movie i half expected it to be a low budget plot less indy film but thought i'd give it a try i started watching part 1 and couldn't pull myself away till it ended 3 hours later it was by far one of my absolute favorite films of all time from the writing to the directing to the performances i was laughing crying and singing all the way through nan rite of passage from innocence to adulthood rachael stirling is phenomenal in this film i had never heard of her before but now i will forever remember the vulnerability and strength i felt in her performance she hawes and may are incredible as they guide you through the emotional turmoils that most feel as they deal with an alternate form of sexuality the fact that the film is set in the 1890's not only educates the audience about homosexuality in that time period but makes a statement about our society today you must see this film and probably like myself you'll be making a trip to the store to add it to your collection,1
4270,virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america the only differences are an ending that ties up the loose bits differently than an american film would and a cameo by ram john holder which is always welcome that's enough to make this a watcher on a cold winter's night,0
4271,although it isn't mentioned very often don't look in the basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch the story follows a young nurse charlotte beale who is hired at stephen's sanitarium to replace dr stephens after he is murdered by a patient many patients begin to torment miss beale and her boss dr geraldine masters acts as if she's hiding something br br this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesn't happen very often in horror films the musical score is great and is reminiscent of dark shadows the performance from rosie rhea mcadams and bill are all great the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending this movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film i have ever seen has been able to capture many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic don't look in the basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive in films,1

4274,and now i'm up to episode 7 i really was hoping it'd be over by now not to mention canceled once everything connected with the show including the actors had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere never to be seen again because this series really is dire br br to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before in some episodes i haven't even laughed once br br oh and i can't believe o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' started doing this instead his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day perhaps he simply can't read and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for were don't get me wrong 'my hero' is not masterpiece but it's a million times better than this piece of junk br br and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released,0
4275,the real surprise of this effortlessly lightweight movie is how such a top notch cast got assembled for what is nothing more than a hammy uninspiring affair presumably it was a proverbial snowball rolling down a hill gathering pace and size and shape one can imagine that by the time miranda richardson got contacted by her agent the conversation went along the lines of 'do you want to shoot a movie in dublin scripted by neil jordan michael caine and michael are already in ' this is a dull 'comedy' that sees michael caine and dylan moran try and pull off a well planned hustle where moran must imitate a london gangland boss whose arrival is imminent to collect a sizeable sum of cash from local kingpin michael the rest is simply a forgettable romp that is thankfully over quite quickly moran is mildly amusing in places but on this evidence is better suited to life on the small screen in hit comedies such as black books caine is unchallenged in his role and gives a steady performance without being overstretched one can only imagine what made him sign up for this movie it can't even have been a summer in dublin given that many of the scenes look positively autumnal in the background actually steals the show and anyone who has caught some of his performances in the likes of have i got news for you will know that he is a wonderfully funny man but overall the result is disappointing and it seems a lifetime ago that neil jordan was making quality movies of the likes of mona lisa,0
4276,let me ask you one more question ha what a great soon this movie was brilliant fantastic acting great script the only reason no one noticed it was because of the low budget everyone will agree with me that its a cult just like donnie brasco it shows a young joe pesci once again as a mobster this film is up their with the cults its got some sopranos and some goodfellas chase got his idea for the sopranos when he watched this and scorsese found joe pesci while watching it that proves it must be a great am i right or am i wrong i've got to admit they showed one brilliant scene where they were throwing peanuts at a camp piano player stop with the friggen peanuts,1
4277,i've seen this movie at least 8 times and i still laugh every time the movie is about how an intelligent and motivated man against all odds can cheat the entire over self confident system br br this movie is for all people who like a funny movie br br the action and comedy is well mixed into a brilliant film that i hope to see on dvd soon br br,1
4278,br br what more can you ask for a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true 10 on the rating scale,1
4279,in this film there is a loose plot of a man bardem who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business and marries a woman he does not love the wide eyed maria de in the process he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web he never gives up his juggling act until the three main characters come face to face the film results boring with lots of free sex well both girls are really good all the reactions in the film are absurd incoherent and of course too much stupid none of the characters are believable which makes the movie a little annoying anyway the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film which makes it a little interesting but if you can watch another film please,0
4280,being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit br br it was an awful film though the story was similar to the games plot the whole super human soldiers thing other than that jack carver an all american man in the game is played by a unless thats some sort of twisted irony that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forest br br this is a note to all directors if you ever plan to make a film based on a game book play it understand it and ask fans about it don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it,0
4281,at last a great film that doesn't have to be edited for profanity or sex it's a fun film that the whole family can enjoy willis is great as always rusty was delightful just enough action to keep interest going,1
4282,hoot is about these three teenage kids who try to save a bunch of burrowing owls now to me i thinks that right they stand up to whats right and whats wrong in this film a kid name roy eberhardt logan lerman moved from montana to florida and once he gets on the bus a bully name dana starts bullying him finally the next day roy punches the bully and runs off the bus chasing the mysterious running boy after all that roy finally meets the running boy who's name is mullet fingers cody well actually his nickname his step sister beatrice brie larson gave it to him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands anyway mullet fingers and roy becomes friends and they join together with beatrice to stop the construction of a new pancake restaurant mullet fingers is the one behind all the that happened there and also later he gets bit by one of the dogs that put there to guard the construction site so they stood up to the that was driving the bulldozer and everybody got to see the owls it turned out to be a great movie because it showed where kids can make a difference in life by standing up to whats right and whats wrong thats what is great about this movie it teaches a lot to everyone about wildlife and how important it is,1
4283,let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile after finally getting the chance to see it last night i'm sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed it's hard to imagine a film that could make last exorcist the beginning look good but dominion does just that no wait it makes it look like a great film br br perhaps i got myself too excited about this movie and that contributed to the let down after all the idea that warner bros was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction plus i'm a huge fan of stellan and in true fashion he gives a great performance despite the often ridiculous content of the film on the other hand the supporting cast in this film is abysmal clara seems to be capable of only one expression blank stare and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone while gabrielle mann's father frances is just ridiculous the effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously this movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either i could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers but frankly i'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things i'd love to say br br the saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past had huge potential especially with as leading man unfortunately for us that potential was wasted go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the harlin version but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life otherwise be content with the version first released and move on,0

4285,i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice,0
4286,darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake edwards is shown to be at his best he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen br br the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews br br for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock br br as it is inspirational purely inspirational one of andrews most memorable lines in this film,1
4287,at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles set the plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things or just a lot was edited from the movie the characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the movie i suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they had if they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now there's a new terrible movie coming out this friday my opinion don't waste your time or money,0

4289,this so called movie is horrible the actors cannot act there is no plot i believe they need to start from scratch and film again i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again maybe there is hope for it i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job the wardrobe could have been much better sorry but this just did not do it for me i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but this one i cannot find entertaining i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film,0
4290,successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare but fata morgana is a good case you can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth but herzog does an amazingly good job the movie's point is to show human beings and even the world from a non human point of view br br the movie is in three parts creation paradise and the golden age the imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice over although the text of the from the a mayan myth refers to the primordial wasteland the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth it dwells on the waste and on various specimens of destruction fire smoke wrecked vehicles the images from paradise' are anything but that and the golden age' is darkly comic  the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act br br the suggests that mankind is the central object of creation but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time there are no human characters to speak of when a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view by the end it is much more the dog's likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it and the turtle's partner barely looks human with his big flippers br br animal stories and nature documentaries always but fata morgana has none of that certainly the dunes look like a female body but the cuts both ways presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains lakes and waterfalls people and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape br br in 1979 herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade nosferatu from the vampire's point of view,1
4291,every review i have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays the scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken so listen again and note the difference the play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well enunciated english i am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of walter scott which was written in the tone of the border i come from the border and when i read it as it should be read it made all the difference,1
4292,this is one of those movies that you just don't want to end the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war a young man is taken in by a dynamic big hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences br br i couldn't believe this was a made for television film it was so well executed s is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role you want to be right there amongst her boarders br br i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd,1
4293,yup that's right folks this is undoubtedly the worst show in the history of television if you want to watch a sad lonely and unfunny hack comedian attempt to entertain the masses with a half hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your mildly retarded cousin commented on at the thanksgiving dinner table then this might be the show for you this is billed as edgy comedy my friends but to be honest this makes tim allen look like richard pryor avoid at all costs unless you're a masochist,0

4296,i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this movie other than the mother being a complete moron on a few occasions and the youngest daughter being idiotic enough to go out at night into woods that scared her in the daytime this movie was pretty good had the director had the sense to treat us as if we had brains maybe he'd have given us a movie where the people didn't have to behave idiotically but still manage to get into danger it worked for the plumber and the fellow in the trailer but apparently the teenagers and the mother needed to be idiots for the director to get closure in ending this film br br atmosphere was great scenery was awesome and the undead kids scared the crap out of me i live in a wooded area so taking out the trash will creep me out for quite a while the movie works for me accept for what i already mentioned raise the mom's iq a bit and i'd give it a ten,1
4297,i absolutely love this film and have seen it many times i taped it in about 1987 when it was shown on channel four but my tape is severely worn now and i would love a new copy of it i have e mailed film four to ask them to show it again as it has never been available on video and as far as i know hasn't been repeated since the 80's i have had no reply and it still hasn't been repeated the performances are superb the film has everything its funny sad disturbing exciting and totally takes you back to school days it is extremely well paced and grips you from start to end the scene in the shower room is particularly horrific i also cannot hear the song badge by cream and not think of this film this film deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is superb channel four please show again or release on video or dvd,1
4298,another fabulous movie from catherine this time about the difficulties of shooting a sex scene in a movie using comedy  a new genre for  we get a backstage view of filmmaking but in documentary style the character who plays the director in the movie is based on the sex scene in question is taken from her earlier film a ma as is the main teenage actress but the film like all of work is not entertainment alone it is peppered with philosophical observations on the nature of sexuality as well as demonstrating a devotion to as opposed to pornography that is a cornerstone of work and a devotion to real emotion we see the director character harangue the young lead actress and actor to bring the best out in them hypnotising them into the parts they need to play bringing out part of themselves that the director can see in them but they cannot see in themselves until they achieve the heights of acting that she demands of them she makes meaningful movies not titillation but she shows the work that is needed to produce this and so gives us insights both into the decidedly french film making process and the psychology of male  female sexuality,1
4299,this was on showtime the other night and i figured it was going to be another made for video crap fest like earth vs the spider or any of those other hbo horror shorts instead i found a comedy gore classic it was legitimately funny and surprisingly the acting was quite good even my wife an overall horror hater agreed and was laughing at parts in addition the fx were high quality br br overall the film felt like a parody of joy ride jeepers creepers and the 2 main characters reminded me of the pair from shaun of the dead definitely worth watching but don't take it seriously br br the end,1
4300,this movie was chosen quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store it turned out to be quite a pig the plot line such as it is was disjointed inconsistent and predictable the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines the only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the deployment of an airbag the remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters aged less than ten years myself my wife my mother in law or even the cat or the dog my advice if you are tempted to borrow this turkey is to save your money and your time look for something else,0
4301,when dubbed into another language let's face it neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose loose situation any type of voice over is sure to be an improvement and it actually is at least in the german version br br but that is only a minor point the acting is bad the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid who has had some martial arts training no doubt and to the athleticism shown off by bergman br br schwarzenegger does his conan thing nothing new here br br some of the visuals are nice i'll have to grant that the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool but more often than not the plaster is all too evident br br overall the movie isn't worth seeing even the is better than this although only marginally i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be but i doubt that that could have saved this movie oh well br br 3 10,0
4302,i'm a petty officer 1st class e 6 and have been in the for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when po fischer kutcher went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center supposedly in it looked more like a nasa command center we don't have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist controller a radio otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days,1
4303,this video was my first introduction to the residents and i couldn't stop playing it for the past three days the visuals are dynamite and more inventive and technically complex than any i have ever seen on the big screen or small br br the dvd loses points however for the pointless addition of new music the original residents music is unlike anything else you've ever heard and will really tweak your brain in the best possible way the new music however is uniformly uninteresting and in most cases is rather bad in comparison to some of the classic tracks also the uncompleted vileness fats video feels very incomplete and i could only fathom the plot of the story from extensive reading of the notes on the disc br br speaking of notes on the disc this dvd features lots of cool easter eggs that will probably appeal to long time fans of the residents hint look for icons on the notes pages that shouldn't be there br br from a technical standpoint the disc is one of the best dvd transfers available there is virtually no and only a little edginess in strong contrast points br br kudos for a top notch presentation this disc really deserves your attention,1
4304,without a doubt the best burt reynolds film ever even better than smokey and the bandit this was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor action mystery and style that is missing in today's films br br this one has it all a psychotic henry silva jacked up on pcp 1 000 a night call girls ninja assassins and burt reynolds getting his fingers sliced off one by one with a butterfly knife the film is based on the novel by william diehl who also wrote primal fear another one of my all time favorites this movie is worth watching just to see henry silva get shot six times crash through a window and fall thirty stories from the top of an atlanta high rise this is probably the coolest stunt in hollywood history performed by legendary stuntman dar robinson br br robinson also played in the elmore leonard movie stick also starring burt reynolds stick features another great dar robinson stunt robinson falls from a miami apartment building and all six shots from a 44 magnum on his way down very cool stuff br br sharky's machine is my favorite police drama i never understood why this film flopped the way it did if burt did more films like this he would've built a better reputation for himself he proves to be a talented director with sharky as well as a gifted actor burt is supported by brian kieth charles durning bernie casey richard libertini rachel ward and everyone's favorite bad guy henry silva please remake this classic film get affleck and samuel l and some other hot actors and you've got a great movie just waiting to be filmed br br i give it a 9 out of 10,1
4305,i purchased this film on dvd for £4 but it was a waste the film is very bad the plot is your average monster film where it kills a few people the mayor chief doesn't believe it and they fight it at the end br br on the plus side the film quality is very good and the setting of new york is impressive for a budget film as opposed to a small coastal town the acting is reasonable too br br however the special effects in a monster film are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird the ending is just bad br br in summary whenever you have a chance to see this don't there will be something better on br br r t c true horror films don't have a pg rating,0
4306,well where to start describing this celluloid debacle you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot so let's jut point out that this is so pc it's offensive hard to believe that frank oz the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger made this unfunny mess br br so this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out ok sure if anyone ever says i'm gay i'll know the truth even if i currently like girls more than george luca likes a dollar br br and how to know the true nature of my sexuality well if i like classic dancing and barbra streisand i'm gay if i dress like a blind man in a hurry with half my shirt hanging out i'm straight oh sure br br and here's the big cliché of clichés no matter how you look there's always a very attractive hollywood actor who'll adore every bit of grease under your skin or a top model who'll love your zero iq your butt ugly face and your pointing out ears if all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry this did in real world looks matter folks and i know for sure br br i see it coming now you'll say relax it's a comedy don't take it so seriously if being a comedy gives anything carte blanche to suck out loud i think the world has a serious problem wouldn't be much better and funnier to make a movie to those old tiresome clichés instead of magnifying them over and over again br br so one of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen 1 out of 10 if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual please let me know i'm interested,0
4307,of adam's apple and with your permission i didn't know until looking it up just now also the wants to kill i prefer this very focused deadpan drama over adam's apple's over the top comedic zeal but with your permission is much more layered and subtle but that's another director br br once the part of the story takes place i felt the dread of coming back to the shop again and again a bit claustrophobic maybe that is intentional it builds on the atmosphere you dread the rediscovery and again and again until the in the br br this is some funny stuff,1
4308,peter cushing and donald pleasance are legendary actors and director kostas was the man behind the successful greek giallo esquire thriller death kiss in 1974 and yet when you combine the three talents all you get is this complete load of drivel god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids leading another group to go after them the pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this and no doubt done much better the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended,0
4309,i must admit ashamed though i am that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror chiller was one of my favourite all time films nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses and am able to assess fritz work more reasonably br br indeed king's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper but it makes for a cheap average horror show on celluloid a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker slasher show and then turns the finale into a hocus pocus special effects nightmare br br the cast are reasonable but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible over the top movie will allow them and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is than the pictures br br a real shame that george goldsmith's screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror isaac and all the other children of the corn aren't really all that scary br br sunday august 7 1994 video,0

4311,the academy award winning vs follows a snazzy businessman ted kramer dustin hoffman and his divorce with his bored wife meryl streep one day ted's wife leaves him and their child in search for a better life forcing ted to become closer to his son justin henry the two bond and become very close but only after some friction and just as everything is going perfect ted's wife comes back to town and wants sole custody of their son ted then goes on a mission not to let his son get taken away from him and fights his wife in court dustin hoffman gives a tremendous performance along with meryl streep and young justin henry is impressive it's a sad emotional roller coaster of a movie but it's a very well made and inspiring film the film took the oscar for best picture at the 1979 academy awards along with best actor for hoffman and best supporting actress for streep if you don't mind a tearjerker vs is a great film to watch grade b,1
4312,i went in to this thinking another gross movie with gross humor telling from my first sentence i don't like that humor and this movie had it's moments but i loved it justin long has really never done comedy like this where he's sarcastic and clever and i loved it lewis black enough said the ending i really did love because it had to take itself seriously i mean how else would you end it yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal to go to college where they were accepted the cast was amazing and yes i did laugh at loud when i didn't think i would and the laughter lasted longer then i thought to the parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary the movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to they played in to the story very well and i loved the familiar faces anthony boston public jeremy howard i galaxy quest with justin long ross patterson the new guy and sam brink blake lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable as well as b's friends i recommend this movie to whoever hated those gross comedies of the last 4 years and really want something with humor and an actually story line,1
4313,what i find remarkable about this terrific film is that altman the crazy and wild guy that he is took the novel that cold day in the park and the sandy dennis character was originally a male in the book he was a mentally whacked out isolated gay who looked out of his apartment window when he spotted the hustler it is strange that altman fans aren't aware of how clever he was to change the sex of the main character thereby avoiding the homo erotic taboos of gay life in the 60's and actually making dennis' reclusive kind of madness work even better in the transposition if you see the film again it will be evident how wily the altman mind works,1
4314,if you are among the imdb audience that put high fidelity in the all time top 200 then this movie probably is not for you this film is as as steve frears is self consciously hip renee zellweger is excellent as a hip urbane magazine writer who returns to her suburban bucks county nest in order to care for mother streep who delivers yet another hall of fame performance william hurt is ideally cast and the feckless faithless and egotistical husband if this movie doesn't move you to cry and laugh then you are much too hip to enjoy it,1
4315,the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review was written by someone who walked out of this film not even half way through unfortunately for him he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty agreed the film was very slow to start in fact the friend i was with fell asleep briefly i woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental 60s fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel be patient like many great films its well worth the wait and is certainly a film that i will look forward to revisiting 8 10,1
4316,well my dad drove lee evans back and forth the hotels so i got to see some being made its a brilliant film bob pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over br br lee evans was also funny as he seen me and said are you cold i said yes and he said well whack your hands in your pockets i think it was really funny and it will be a well known comedy as like every other lee evans film they were really great people they seemed to be quite polite and funny i would like to meet them again one day brenda blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood down her and twigs in her messy hair and i got really scared as i didn't notice her until she was right behind me,1
4317,first the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex taking drugs and whatever this is just a cheap market scheme she's barely in it and does neither of the things the marketing here is unbelievable and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected br br the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy handed by a teenage quentin tarantino and thats not meant as a compliment mind you br br i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story it seems to be about nothing just about cool teenagers tripping around living 'on the edge' the characters themselves does have some personality though but the movie doesn't use its potential as said there's no story of any substance here it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad it definitely has that feeling br br still though i guess some people might enjoy it but i'd say there's far better movies like this around,0
4318,the 1979 film musical of hair was loosely based on the infamous 1960's broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene the stage musical isn't really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers however for the film director milos foreman who won an oscar for directing one flew over the cuckoo's nest and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more user friendly for the big screen in the film naive farm boy claude hooper john savage is about to go into the army and decides to spend a couple of days in new york where he meets a group of aging hippies treat williams dorsey wright annie golden don who get him involved in a group of nutty misadventures including the pursuit of a snooty society girl beverly d'angelo the story divides into a series of vignettes that range from the ridiculous to the sublime but it is all gorgeously photographed with a clever use of nyc locations and imaginatively staged musical numbers outstandingly choreographed by the legendary treat williams lights up the screen as berger the unconventional and free spirited hippie who does his best to get claude to loosen up and is matched scene for scene by savage as claude who brings a lovely sweetness to the role of claude annie golden is a charmer as jeannie the pregnant hippie who is pregnant by wright or doesn't know which one is the father and doesn't seem to care there is one outstanding musical number after another here aquarius is a tour through central park which includes dancing horses treat williams disrupts a fancy dinner party in i got life black boys white boys features the late nell carter and ellen foley extolling the ethnic virtues of men and easy to be hard is a powerful rendering of one of the best songs in the show by original cast member cheryl barnes who plays wright's ex girlfriend and mother of his child this is a beautifully photographed well acted sung and danced psychedelic acid trip of a movie that must be seen and once seen will initiate multiple viewings as this dazzler has to much to offer to catch it all in one showing,1

4320,having dabbled in the modeling industry as a model i watch this show with a slightly different view than most might while i admit can be a fun and entertaining show as the seasons go on it seems to continue to drift from any reality br br the show seems to be almost pure publicity for its contestants seeing that none of the show's winners or fellow contestants have made much of a name for themselves out from under of the show's umbrella maybe that's because the truth is any girl with real potential to be a high fashion model shouldn't have too much difficulty submitting to agencies you can do so via email or snail mail if distance prevents you from attending an agency open call signing to an agency and starting a modeling career yes the process does not guarantee success but apparently neither does and participating in a reality show seems to offer less of a boost in the modeling business than signing to a top or decent agency which only one contestant each cycle has a guarantee of anyway br br nonetheless the show can't hurt certainly can be amusing and has a sort of magic that particularly works for teenage girls i have found though i must add may become a tad tiring and dull after watching several cycles as it has become for me and besides some unrealistic situations each more outrageous than the last the only other annoyance is the overuse of tyra tyra tyra tyra seems to genuinely want to guide these girls to success but is it necessary for each of temporary digs to be covered in tyra pictures for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that tyra experienced and overcame i think not br br in my opinion take out a little tyra put back in a little more reality and could be a 10 star show instead of a 7,1
4321,it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come oh yeah the public will say moon' that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it that would be such an injustice as the original lonesome dove was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it,0
4322,and quite frankly that just sums it up br br it is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal br br the animation is almost flawless i thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake br br however some of the model shots didn't look quite that realistic br br and i thought that park made a better t rex br br if this is the type of thing we see on a normal british tv series then i cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies br br i give this 10 10 stars br br and the making of video was also great the dinosaur on the skate board was br br,1
4323,this movie was a suprise for me while i was surfing from channel to channel i don't know why but it filled in me with warmth and happiness this is what a high budget movie can not do mostly i liked it this is a must see one br br,1
4324,this movie had very few moments of real drama after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back viewing was pure purgatory to say the least the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing the continuity between some of the scenes was dire characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else surely this was a spoof of the exorcist the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one do i speak latin et tu brutus,0
4325,skeleton man was okay for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so called special force agents hit the screen it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a sled br br the opening makes us think we might have a corny yet fun horror flick on our hands but no the film makers ruin any hope of that when the special force agents show up i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the skeleton man chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand instead the skeleton man chases down some dim witted special force agents and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper hand br br i know the whole stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this br br when the skeleton man finally does meet his so called demise in a building that blows up the captain of the special force agents is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building what the hell happened in there my answer to that question who the hell cares,0
4326,one of the things that i like about pt anderson is that he has the guts to take talent that most people push to the side or have pushed to the side and makes them stars case in point a washed up burt reynolds delivers a great performance in this film and if proving adam sander can be a great actor punch drunk love wasn't enough here comes mark like you've never seen before br br i think many people pass up boogie nights cause they are anti porn or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film but underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves there is a beautiful film and it's too bad that enough people see that,1
4327,acclaimed argentine horror director emilio directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness a doctor's son is nearing his early death until his desperate father transplants an heart into his chest as expected things are going to get weird when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves when heroin is injected his beauties become zombies the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music so bad well it's just bad in the cast jose e moreno alberto mauricio de ferraris gloria prat and gina,0
4328,i think samuel goldwyn was trying to accomplish two things in this film first the film is a homage to jascha considered to be the best violin virtuoso of the past century secondly having brought to the screen the dead end kids with his film of the same title and seeing them sign with warner brothers he was trying to create a second gang of appealing urchins br br though the film was good there certainly was no demand that the kids from this film be reteamed for another feature br br leader of the gang is gene reynolds who at one time played the violin but now leads a street gang of disreputable urchins his stepfather arthur hohl breaks the violin his late father gave young reynolds and threatens to send him to reform school over the feeble protests of his mother marjorie main br br young reynolds happens to stumble onto a music school run by the old music maestro himself walter brennan and his daughter andrea they take him in but they have their financial problems with a lot of creditors led by porter hall br br this film is mostly to be seen today because it's a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear jascha who as you gather is the solution one way or another to everybody's problems joel mccrea is in this film also but has a rather colorless part as andrea boyfriend br br besides one thing the film does do is touch on albeit gingerly on the topic of child abuse and battered spouses arthur hohl is one mean man and marjorie main is very clearly a much battered wife br br the kids in the cast do well reynolds tommy kelly terry and a young girl under the name of jacqueline nash who grew up and performed as gale sherwood nightclub partner to nelson eddy she had a nice soprano even as a child br br but it's you see the show for,1
4329,this movie is not as bad as some say it is infact i think it s more enjoyable than the original maybe that s why some people hate it as much cos they dont want to admit it s a good not great movie br br most if not all fx were done by c g i which i didn t mind at all cos it was an enjoyable movie phil chris was in my opinion the best guy in the movie julie delpy was rather attractive she brought the sexiness to the movie br br there were a lot of wisecracks in the movie which i thought were good this movie is in my collection but the original is not because i dont like it as much as this one i was not bored when i watched this movie it kept me watching unlike some horror movies i could mention like oh say driller killer suspiria dario argento s movie thats to name but two br br this is an ok werewolf film it should be in people s collection if they like werewolf movies maybe i ll get the original at some point maybe i have only one complaint and that is phil chris should have been in it more than he was but apart from that the movie was fine br br rating for this movie 8 10 an ok werewolf movie not the worst one out there br br,1
4330,this movie is simply amazing unfortunately in portugal not even a shadow of him and i agree with a former opinion only ff fans will really give the movie the real credit but for the rest i dare you to watch it the story is great and i thought that the game has ended the story but the screenwriters have given us a great story to the god of all r p g 's the ost as usual it came from heaven but the little details that they gave us us fans of the game are beautiful like the ring tone is the battle winning song of the game and even some moves are quite familiar just watch it it's a great movie great story great animation just a 10 10,1
4331,this show is great not only is a very well written anime show it also reflects things like philosophy science fiction and a little religion it's hilarious at some points and cute for lack of a better term at others actually this may be effect to my lack of experience with japanese anime shows but it is one of the best of its genre i have seen br br i mainly have to give credit to the writers i haven't seen such brilliant scopes of imagination in a television show since the original star trek i hope the writers continue to add strange new characters and give more insight on the already great characters that have been added br br 9 10,1
4332,i was surprised once more my darling had not generated enough votes at this writing for a user rating it's a screwy comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years robert montgomery's mission places him in some very improbable situations and he's just the man for the job he maintains his trademark befuddled look throughout the film and hysterically too ann blyth plays his precocious eccentric pursuer who assumes a relationship that does not exist her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname killer but remains cute and cuddly br br among the glut of b movies from the late 1940's and 1950's once more my darling is a standout this one is worth looking for,1
4333,tep is like a long cool drink of water after crawling across the sahara to classic film buffs who have been too long deprived of that certain cinematic magic not only is it beautifully photographed but the characters are perfectly portrayed if you're looking for the film to be a mirror of the book you will be seriously disappointed instead it is an excellent companion to the book and i think that is what anthony intended ralph fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world not to mention a brilliant actor juliette binoche is the posterchild for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm and of course i'll go see any film in which kristin scott thomas is featured she simply must be the best actress since the likes of deborah kerr so much was promised with this film and so much is delivered,1

4335,certainly expected more after seeing the cast list but wow br br i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like john made it puzzles me to no end somehow the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d list actors whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half the unknown actors were just plain awful less steve who does a decent job as axl the story is so bad that it really needs no mention the overall production value seems standard with some above average camera work if you can make it through the god awful slo mo scenes and the painful person on fire sequences i knew it would be dumb i just had no idea how dumb and unfortunately it's time spent that can never be returned to me i suppose if you enjoy really bad b films this might work for you but if you value any story at all this one is simply dreadful a complete waste of time,0
4336,first i don't see how the movie is on any best list or how it won any awards compared to la pianiste which is also on a best list la pianiste is gold this movie lacked so many things on so many different levels but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much the lead actor was annoying i felt as though i never knew what was going on and i was bored even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting i wanted it to end as soon as possible why did it have to be his sister and cousin ugh and why did get mean he just turned mean and also was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in i mean this in all seriousness but does incest happen a lot in french culture european culture i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that,0

4338,although this episode was offensive to the syndrome association others thought it was funny while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season br br this episode was funny and just shocking south park has made history as being their first episode with the most cuss words unless you count the movie as an episode br br i enjoyed how they made fun of chris hansen and his television show to catch a predator i didn't like the idea on how they thought chris hansen would do a show on and let a boy speak out and bash the jews br br one thing i did not like is how south park thought that people with syndrome would just blurt out bad language like that i've seen people on television with syndrome and they do not just blurt out bad words unless i am incorrect,1
4339,it's very easy to figure out why the new professionals was a dud at least in new zealand it didn't just follow in the footsteps of the original it followed bodyguards which out the show considerably with its boss and two agents formula cmdr mcintyre was a latter day george cowley tough on his team but one who would defend them to the death against others the shadow the show cast was huge br br well not as huge as it should have been in the uk here it was networked in prime time it was even marketed in the promos as 'they are the professionals ' someone else obviously noticed the difference we were fortunate enough not to have this show released in different regions at different time slots br br it was the high production values that sealed the deal for me as other reviewers have noted it followed the great british tradition of the one hour actioner but blended in personal elements at the same time there's a slight undercurrent of something developing between liz and ian though that never distracted one from the real plot most episodes were based around inflammatory diplomatic incidents the sort of thing that helps spooks along from time to time br br unlike many 2000s shows the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photography or over stylish direction directors like christopher young kept the pace up and did their job they made use of good locations making bodyguards slicker than if it had been shot on back roads and alleyways it was contemporary it would still stand up beautifully today and it was one of the better examples of the british actioner in the 1990s showing that the uk can still do them better than anyone else br br maybe except for the germans and their cobra 11,1
4340,it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death br br this movie like the others of that era contrives to bring this about and the viewer knows this there is no mystery or suspense the people squabble but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughable br br the five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts everyone is nuts so that the director writer team can justify their nazi propaganda br br for some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not men br br totally crap and totally depressing,0
4341,i have to agree with all the previous commenter's this is simply the best of all frothy comedies with bardot as sexy as marilyn monroe ever was and definitely with a prettier face maybe there's less mystique but look how marilyn paid for that i don't think i've ever seen such a succulent looking female on screen so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited by it and not just for purely aesthetic reasons if the idiot really want to do their a number they are really going to need to up their standards as no church mice need apply here her breasts the rest of her figure her adorable voice the hilarious way she shakes as she walks across a room only to arrive in front of a man breasts literally pointed as if in exquisite confrontation br br i think boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all of film history no one played opposite more great female stars than did he garbo dietrich k hepburn colbert and here bardot among many others and he was also in with leslie caron and had small parts in 'how to steal a with a hepburn as well as being in the deneuve movie 'the april although not opposite her the only thing i could disagree with in remarks is that even the loud obnoxious music over the opening credits is appropriate i mean bardot is not meant to be subtle on top of everything else and her essential loudness i don't mean her voice is part of her irresistible and one might even say exemplary charm br br vidal is thoroughly handsome even if pouty brigitte says toward the beginning 'i don't know why i am in love with you you're not even handsome ' br br dear dear bardot truly one of the wonders of the 20th century not to mention the joy that she is still with us when so many of the truly characterful are passing away so fast in all her eccentric glory,1
4342,just watched this movie over the weekend and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it the 2 italo american actors are excellent as usual michael imperioli and john ventimiglia it is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by italians primarily he was influenced by dino and his film il it is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends one is extroverted and the other is introverted they enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony the same thing happens to albert de santi unfortunately il has a very similar ending and this apparently influenced the director of on the run because he uses the same technique but with a twist i had expected something but was surprised to see that it turned out to be the opposite if you watch both movies you will understand the other film that influenced the director is after hours directed by the great italian american scorsese i highly recommend all 3 movies,1
4343,if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting culture have gone to waste here in a horrible way maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish european film for big audiences i'm sure they wanted it to be all state of the art smart and touching at the same time the result is crap br br to make it short the story is pretentious naïve and not credible the same goes for the characters i can imagine them about making a film where everything would like turn to t and people would be hurt and feel you know really bad inside because finnish people are so notoriously depressed too and their self esteem is so bad which brings us to the fact that br br the film is loaded with clichés mostly about the finnish mentality the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull psychology self help book we feel so bad inside i'm sure they watched some too to find out what it is about his films that people like misunderstood him completely and came up with a boring depressing story about people going through all kinds of s t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here it's just a sign of trying to be smart and of not being br br i think the worst fault however is the complete lack of vision and depth the film is highly unoriginal it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it i can go through this kind of mind ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke or better yet something sublime like in e g von trier's breaking the waves there was none these in maa actually though i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable over the top and incredible br br who does this crap and who likes it i hope they're pretending,0

4347,that was one of the lines in a trailer about this film and for once the publicists did not exaggerate all six of the featured players here are on the screen 99 of the time so they have to be good br br it's always fascinating how certain plot premises can be worked for either comedy to a deadly serious situation mary boland of the ditzy and charlie of the henpecked play their usual characters who are planning to motor all the way to california to share expenses they advertise for someone to share the ride they get burns and allen and a monster of a dog that same premise was a deadly serious one several generations later in kalifornia br br of course if you're traveling with gracie allen you know you're going to be going absolutely nuts trying to figure her monty reasoning about the whole world and if that ain't enough you get to run into w c fields part time sheriff and full time pool hustler who's living in sin with alison but back then we didn't delve into such things br br a real classic comedy from the thirties not to be missed,1
4348,i have viewed this cartoon as a child a father and now a grand father it is my favorite cartoon i love the characters the great little tunes and the very good drawings i totally love the main song which comes up throughout the cartoon i think it is a beautiful little cartoon everyone i have shown it to simply loves it it is too bad it opened on such a bad day pearl harbor bombing if it wasn't for the bad timing it would have been a great success i hope i can find a dvd of it because all the vhs tapes don't do it justice br br i think if anyone shows it to their child they will come up with the same result they will just love it br br,1
4349,i enjoyed the movie and the story immensely i have seen the original 1939 i believe and enjoyed them both to really appreciate the story one must be familiar with english culture and customs the prof peter o'toole was dedicated to his school and the boys in that school it was an english public school which we in the u s refer to as a private school e g he is a very person and on the surface gives the appearance of being stiff stuffy uncaring and weak to the point of being effeminate he is strict in his educational standards because he does care for his lads i e he doesn't want them to get a cheap or weak education he meets through introduction a dance hall girl clark and is totally smitten in england at the time the reference to dance hall carried the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was definitely lower class we find that the prof is in fact a very tough and courageous person as well as loyal to people and institutions that he loves and or respects clark becomes more than a lover and wife she his personality and allows him to grow as a man and a person much to the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness the first movie was set before ww ii this one goes through ww ii also it is 1969 we've had the british invasion beetles etc clark had hits and was very popular then still is to me the music is great color and photography excellent i think o'toole played the character perfectly there are dedicated people like chips all around us but many do not receive the recognition very enjoyable movie and story,1
4350,first of all i know almost nothing about rugby so although i found the rugby aspect of this movie to be interesting it could have been any sport and i think i would have enjoyed it just as much the fact that it as about rugby didn't make it any better or worse for me br br what made this movie great is the story itself based on actual events that have occurred over the last 30 years with the highland rugby club coach is the kind of coach that most every parent would like their children to have someone who cares more about the person than the sport even though they have won 17 national championships and have only lost 9 games in over 30 years the more i have learned about the coach and team the more i like this movie and its message br br i have seen other sports movies that seemed great at first but then i researched the details only to find that most of those movies were 10 fact and 90 fiction with the 10 of facts being greatly exaggerated not so with forever strong it may seem too good to be true but that's what's so amazing about it if it were fiction it would just be an enjoyable story and nothing more instead the movie is inspirational and makes you want to be a better person br br don't miss this movie because of a few negative reviews by professional critics i have been reading some of their reviews and most of them have given the movie horrible reviews these are generally the same critics who rave about movies that most people hate in fact i would be worried if some of these critics had given the movie good reviews because i almost always disagree with their opinions br br go see this movie and post your review positive or negative currently most of the audience reviews are enthusiastically positive here and on rotten tomatoes and similar sites and i am interested to see if this trend continues thanks,1
4351,this appears to be two movies spliced into one in the first zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie ok i'd never heard of her before either but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction br br before we know it pitts is no longer miss polly she is i had to rewind to see if i'd fallen asleep somewhere i hadn't she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination br br the movie has some cute moments the first part is better with roles for what seems to be every third rate character actress working in hollywood at the time br br and what of ms she sounds a little like betty hutton she sounds a little like marie wilson she's pretty certainly but she's no comedienne br br pitts often was used in very small roles here she has the largest role she's always fun though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way as a comic when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents the wedding march and greed are the two i have seen she was brilliant,0
4352,i just rented this movie from the video store last night it being new and not released long ago here the rent was only overnight me my little sis and my older brother who usually hates watching these kind of movies sat down and watched once the movie started and after sitting there watching it for a while we were all laughing historically even my brother this movie is hilarious i actually laughed no matter how funny some movies are even if i think its funny i sometimes can't seem to laugh but this movie i laughed my brother ended up thinking it was the best that type of movie he had seen i ended up watching the movie again about 2 or 3 hours later,1
4353,campfire tales is basically made up of three spooky stories that a group of friends tell after they get into a car crash in the woods after a concert the film begins with the classic hook story and then we're introduced to the group of friends driving home from the concert they crash their car put out some flares and start a fire in a little abandoned chapel waiting for someone to arrive with help as they warm themselves by the fire to pass the time they decide to start telling classic horror stories about terrorized honeymooners a girl who falls prey to an internet predator and a motorist who takes refuge in a haunted house as they tell the eerie tales each story becomes increasingly terrifying but the real shock that awaits them is yet to come br br in my opinion the last story they tell is probably the scariest and had some genuine frightening effects the first story was alright and the sequence near the end was a little creepy the second story built a lot of suspense more than either of the others did but it's unoriginal plot was it's downfall i remember watching this movie a long time ago when i was like eight years old on hbo and the third story scared the crap out of me although it's not scary to me now you'll probably recognize some of the cast here particularly amy smart from the opening hook interlude story and christine taylor as one of the main actresses in the film the twist ending was kinda interesting too i know i didn't see that coming i thought it was all cleverly pieced together br br to sum things up if you're looking for a horror movie that is worth the while rent this you should be happy it's a great anthology of some classic urban legends and the whole film was tied together neatly it is much better than what one would expect 7 10,1
4354,what was the aim here i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim poor acting no action and no story i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's 250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go br br war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film,0
4355,delivers great acting and greater special effects stars david cronenberg one of my personal favorites as decker it's special effects on the monsters were so good you thought they might be really deformed clive barker however demented scored a perfect 10 on my list,1
4356,charmed was awesome i don't get how pheobe goes to the underworld and makes a deal with the source but then in season 4 is back how does she get back is there a deleted episode that was never showed i am confused i brought 1 2 3 4 5 and season 8 but am still confused will someone help me help help help h e l p br br h e l p br br h e l p br br h e l p me me me me lull lull loll br br loll loll lull loll loll lull br br br br loll lull loll lull ll lull,1
4357,this film truly was poor i went to the theatre expecting something exciting and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my guess the next plot twist before it happens skills seriously the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see nothing was truly shocking in fact even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much br br the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his investigative epiphany goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience little br br probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the x files treatment every building in the film whether it's the precinct building or a house at noon or a hospital was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting not to mention a lack of in the case of the hospital i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch it sure would have been nice br br mr lambert really isn't an oscar grade actor so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth in the end i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching the warriors otherwise you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as silence of the lambs,0
4358,in this early fulci work the director shows his most mainstream side as well as a talent for compelling storytelling and more than reasonable elucidation for the genre personally i think he has been unfairly maligned throughout his career as an aesthete of gore it's a pretty capable procedural and surprised me with its rich narrative that shows his distrust for small minded small town mentality and the of the police as well as the twisted ideals of the catholic church the last of which seemed to have cut this film at its knees when it was first released and could have possibly given the director another direction so early on the comparative lack of gore in the film shows a more urgent and psychological imperative to this film in its prevailing mystery but the gore and puppetry he does utilise is put to good use here most notably in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senselessly lynched by a mob of men in a graveyard and left for dead in a show of vile and antiquated vigilantism expertly choreographed to the modern tunes off a diegetic radio br br another example was the final scene which was indeed awesome in which a strikingly handsome priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is markedly showed in a medium closeup which accentuated its demonic appearance and evident ugliness curiously considering his later works fulci also invokes the idea of modernity seized upon the hamlet holding on to its anachronistic superstitions and ignorance when the idea of black magic is just that a quaint idea of supernatural evil that never really ends up manifesting from the voodoo dolls while making its witch nothing more than a disturbed woman another thing i liked was that he adds to these character layers by making a bourgeois city girl into an ambiguous figure is she the corrupter the priest fears for his wards and perhaps more tellingly for himself this giallo does lend itself to becoming one of fulci's more personal and substantive films in that we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him,1
4359,michael played by steven robertson has palsy and lives a quiet and dull life in residential home when a newcomer to the home rory mcavoy befriends him he proceeds to show michael how to live past the disability despite or maybe because of crippling disability unable to move all but his head and a few digits on his hand rory is fiercely independent and extremely rebellious his affect upon the quiet and reserve michael is spectacular and the two soon leave the care home to set up lives in the outside world where they recruit the help of siobhan romola garai as a care assistant br br this film is one of the gems of the year much like last year's in america the film goes from being extremely funny to distressing touching upsetting and truly moving without once seeming saccharine sweet knowing exactly where to tug at the heartstrings and where to simply let the story and characters do their thing o'donnell has crafted a wonderful film which tells us all to look past the surface and see what lies within br br the true strengths of the film come in the lead actors so convincing are their characters that you truly do believe that they are disabled to further manage to convey humor and sorrow on top of the already great performances is amazing the pair really seem close friends and as their tale unfolds you care completely for them br br this is definitely one of the finest examples of film this year telling a very relevant story in a simple way if this film fails to touch your heart then you must contain pure ice inside,1
4360,i grew up in winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday there are good and bad in every race why make them all out to be bad that goes for all races today john harper was an educated man he graduated from high school he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve how do i know this john harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation he was a kind and gentle soul he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right i wasn't very old when he left our house but i can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn't be bothered he even taught grade 3 the year before he came to winnipeg none of this is mentioned in the movie and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as i'm concerned what happened to john is unforgivable not only in the native community but also in the white community not everyone in winnipeg think like the police do i knew the person inside and what he was like as a person not an indian,1
4361,i saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic it does well in portraying issues that the average high school student is subjected to br br i left the movie feeling stunned and saddened and yet grateful that this movie will have a chance to raise awareness through its audiences regarding these issues bullying rape suicide and depression br br its a fantastic aussie film br br go see it br br support it br br learn from it,1
4362,wow what a racist profane piece of celluloid garbage and what an insult to the great genre of westerns br br exploitive sex scenes abound profanity abounds violence and gore abounds everything that gives modern movies such a good name especially among those who prefer classic era movies this is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today's films br br somehow i just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in randolph scott or gene films nor can i picture hearing motherf er exclaimed here and there i sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago yet the f word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas not the old west of the 1800s br br prejudice well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain do you think someone might complain about a racist movie home come we don't hear an outcry when the reverse as demonstrated in this film is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country br br mario van peeples wrote directed and starred in this bomb remember that name apparently he is the ed wood of today's filmmakers even spike lee wouldn't be this racist you can't get much worse than this movie,0
